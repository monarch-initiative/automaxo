28669521	Management of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in sickle cell disease: Prevention, diagnosis, treatment.	Transfusion remains a key treatment of sickle cell disease complications. However, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, the most serious complication of transfusion, may be life-threatening if hyperhemolysis develops. This syndrome is generally underdiagnosed because its biological and clinical features resemble those of vaso-occlusive crisis, and red blood cell antibodies are frequently absent. Further transfusions may aggravate the symptoms, leading to severe multiple organ failure and death. It is therefore essential to prevent, diagnose and treat this syndrome efficiently. Prevention is based principally on the attenuation of allo-immunization through the provision of extended-matched RBCs or the use of rituximab. However, such treatment may be insufficient. Early diagnosis might make it possible to implement specific treatments in some cases, thereby avoiding the need for secondary transfusion. Diagnosis is dependent on the knowledge of the medical staff. Finally, many treatments, including steroids, immunoglobulins, erythropoietin and eculizumab, have been used to improve outcome. Improvements in our knowledge of the specific features of DHTR in SCD should facilitate management of this syndrome.
29581211	Effects of vaccines in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic review protocol.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haematological disorder caused by a single point mutation (Glub6Val) that promotes polymerisation of haemoglobin S and sickling of erythrocytes. Inflammation, haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and organ damage characterise the highly variable clinical expression of SCD. People with SCD are at increased risk of severe infections, hence the need for vaccination against common disease-causing organisms in this population. We aim to review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in people with SCD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present systematic review will examine the current data as indexed in PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE and EBSCOHost. We will consult Strategic Advisory Group of Experts practice statements, conference abstracts, reference lists of relevant articles, WHO ICTRP trial registry and experts in the field. Two authors will independently screen search outputs, select studies, extract data and assess risk of bias; resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus between the two authors or arbitration by a third author when necessary. We will perform a meta-analysis for clinically homogenous studies. Evidence from clinically diverse studies will be aggregated using narrative synthesis of the findings. In either case, we will use the GRADE approach to assess the strength of the available evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study draws on data that are readily available in the public domain, hence no formal ethical review and approval is required. The findings of this review will be disseminated through conference presentations and a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018084051.
35929611	The effect of intensity of conditioning regimen on the outcome of HSCT in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study describes the effect of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes among children younger than 14 years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent HSCT, 45 (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%) had MUD. The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at 2 years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% in the RIC group (p < .001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range 26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS was 100% in both groups at 2 years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in patients who underwent MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well tolerated and associated with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD. There was a high rate of secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future studies are needed to optimize RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD.
31467062	Lentiviral and genome-editing strategies for the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies.	beta-Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most prevalent monogenic diseases. These disorders are caused by quantitative or qualitative defects in the production of adult hemoglobin. Gene therapy is a potential treatment option for patients lacking an allogenic compatible hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor. New-generation lentiviral vectors (LVs) carrying a beta-globin-like gene have revolutionized this field by allowing effective HSC transduction, with no evidence of genotoxicity to date. Several clinical trials with different types of vector are underway worldwide; the initial results are encouraging with regard to the sustained production of therapeutic hemoglobin, improved biological parameters, a lower transfusion requirement, and better quality of life. Long-term follow-up studies will confirm the safety of LV-based gene therapy. The optimization of patient conditioning, HSC harvesting, and HSC transduction has further improved the therapeutic potential of this approach. Novel LV-based strategies for reactivating endogenous fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are also promising, because elevated HbF levels can reduce the severity of both beta-thalassemia and SCD. Lastly, genome-editing approaches designed to correct the disease-causing mutation or reactivate HbF are currently under investigation. Here, we discuss the clinical outcomes of current LV-based gene addition trials and the promising advantages of novel alternative therapeutic strategies.
37023225	Managing Sickle Cell Disease in Patients for Whom Blood Transfusion Is Not an Option.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder affecting beta hemoglobin. This disorder causes sickle-shaped red blood cells with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity resulting in vaso-occlusive crises. These crises are often treated with analgesics, antibiotics, IV fluids, supplementary oxygen, and allogeneic blood transfusion. This treatment regimen becomes complicated when caring for SCD patients for whom blood transfusion is not an option. Blood transfusion may not be an option due to the patient's religious, personal, or medical concerns and in scenarios where blood is not available for transfusion. Some examples include the patient being a Jehovah's Witness, blood-borne pathogens concerns, or prior history of multiple alloantibodies and severe transfusion reactions. The number of patients in these categories is growing. The patients and their autonomy should be respected during treatment. This review focuses on the currently available modalities to best manage this subgroup of SCD patients without blood transfusion, including new professional guidelines and new therapies to reduce the severity of SCD as approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2017.
29112240	Splenectomy versus conservative management for acute sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Acute splenic sequestration crises are a complication of sickle cell disease, with high mortality rates and frequent recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with their consequences, are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts of the world. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched clinical trial registries. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy.Date of the most recent search: 14 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease.There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.
31163468	[What's new in diagnostics and treatment of hemoglobinopathies?]	Improvement of care for thalassemia during previous decades focussed on the development of new diagnostic and treatment modalities concerning secondary hemochromatosis resulting from symptomatic treatment with regular transfusion. In addition, hematopoetic stem transplantation as the so far only curative approach had been developed and constantly improved. New approaches for the treatment of thalassemias already entering clinical practice include e. g. additive gene therapy and medical treatment with new drugs like luspatercept. For sickle cell disease, a variety of treatment approaches either to correct the genetic change by gene therapy, to affect the underlying mechanism of sickling e. g. by R-state- stabilising agents, or later the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive complications e. g. by inhibiting selectins are currently thoroughly investigated and some of them will probably get approval very soon.

33979369	Cardiovascular benefits of a home-based exercise program in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The benefits of exercise in patients with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, are well established. For patients with sickle cell disease, medical recommendation was to avoid physical exercise for fear of triggering painful crises or increasing the impairment of the cardiopulmonary function. Only recently, studies have shown safety in exercise programs for this population. Despite that, there is no report that assess the effects of physical exercise on cardiac parameters in patients with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of regular physical exercise (a home-based program) on cardiovascular function in patients with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A quasi-randomized prospective controlled trial. SETTING: During the years 2015 and 2016, we started recruiting among adult patients treated at a Brazilian Center for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease to participate in a study involving a home exercise program. The experimental (exercise) and control groups were submitted to clinical evaluation and cardiovascular tests before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance was applied to compare groups, considering time and group factors. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven adult outpatients with a sickle cell disease diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise group (N = 14): a regular home-based aerobic exercise program, three to five times per week not exceeding give times per week, for eight weeks; no prescription for the control group (N = 13). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic and treadmill test parameters. RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvement in cardiovascular tests, demonstrated by increased distance traveled on a treadmill (p<0.01), increased ejection fraction (p < 0.01) and improvement of diastolic function assessed by mitral tissue Doppler E' wave on echocardiography (p = 0.04). None of the patients presented a sickle cell crisis or worsening of symptoms during the exercise program. CONCLUSION: The selected home-based exercise program is safe, feasible, and promotes a favorable impact on functional capacity and cardiovascular function in sickle cell disease patients.
33283989	CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and beta-Thalassemia.	Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses gamma-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer. Approximately 80% of the alleles at this locus were modified, with no evidence of off-target editing. After undergoing myeloablation, two patients - one with TDT and the other with SCD - received autologous CD34+ cells edited with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the same BCL11A enhancer. More than a year later, both patients had high levels of allelic editing in bone marrow and blood, increases in fetal hemoglobin that were distributed pancellularly, transfusion independence, and (in the patient with SCD) elimination of vaso-occlusive episodes.

36485129	Knowledge to date on secondary malignancy following hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, gene therapy, and gene editing offer a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Unfortunately, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia development have been higher than expected after graft rejection following nonmyeloablative conditioning and lentivirus-based gene therapy employing myeloablative busulfan for SCD. Somatic mutations discovered in 2 of 76 patients who rejected their grafts were identified at baseline at much lower levels. While a whole-genome sequencing analysis reported no difference between patients with SCD and controls, a study including whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with SCD compared with controls. Genetic risk factors for myeloid malignancy development after curative therapy for SCD are currently being explored. Once discovered, decisions could be made about whether gene therapy may be feasible vs allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, which results in full donor chimerism. In the meantime, care should be taken to perform a benefit/risk assessment to help patients identify the best curative approach for them. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for myeloid malignancies and other adverse effects of curative therapies for SCD.
28257476	Cardiac iron overload in chronically transfused patients with thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome.	The risk and clinical significance of cardiac iron overload due to chronic transfusion varies with the underlying disease. Cardiac iron overload shortens the life expectancy of patients with thalassemia, whereas its effect is unclear in those with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), iron does not seem to deposit quickly in the heart. Our primary objective was to assess through a multicentric study the prevalence of cardiac iron overload, defined as a cardiovascular magnetic resonance T2*<20 ms, in patients with thalassemia, SCA, or MDS. Patient inclusion criteria were an accurate record of erythrocyte concentrates (ECs) received, a transfusion history >8 ECs in the past year, and age older than 6 years. We included from 9 centers 20 patients with thalassemia, 41 with SCA, and 25 with MDS in 2012-2014. Erythrocytapharesis did not consistently prevent iron overload in patients with SCA. Cardiac iron overload was found in 3 (15%) patients with thalassemia, none with SCA, and 4 (16%) with MDS. The liver iron content (LIC) ranged from 10.4 to 15.2 mg/g dry weight, with no significant differences across groups (P = 0.29). Abnormal T2* was not significantly associated with any of the measures of transfusion or chelation. Ferritin levels showed a strong association with LIC. Non-transferrin-bound iron was high in the thalassemia and MDS groups but low in the SCA group (P<0.001). Hepcidin was low in thalassemia, normal in SCA, and markedly elevated in MDS (P<0.001). Two mechanisms may explain that iron deposition largely spares the heart in SCA: the high level of erythropoiesis recycles the iron and the chronic inflammation retains iron within the macrophages. Thalassemia, in contrast, is characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis, unable to handle free iron. Iron accumulation varies widely in MDS syndromes due to the competing influences of abnormal erythropoiesis, excess iron supply, and inflammation.

36322937	Hydroxyurea for secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia in Nigeria: a randomized controlled trial.	We tested the hypothesis that fixed oral moderate-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) for initial treatment of secondary stroke prevention results in an 80% relative risk reduction of stroke or death when compared with fixed oral low-dose hydroxyurea (10 mg/kg per day) in a phase 3 double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in Nigeria. A total of 101 participants were randomly allocated to low-dose (n = 49) and moderate-dose (n = 52) hydroxyurea treatment groups. The median participant follow-up was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3), with a planned minimum follow-up of 3.0 years. A total of 6 recurrent strokes and 2 deaths vs 5 recurrent strokes and 3 deaths occurred in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the primary outcome measure of stroke or death in the low- and moderate-dose hydroxyurea treatment groups was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-3.00; P = .97). The trial was stopped early owing to no clinical difference in the incidence rates of the primary outcome measure. The incidence rates of recurrent strokes were 7.1 and 6.0 per 100 person-years in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively, (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.30-4.88; P = .74). As a measure of adherence to the oral hydroxyurea therapy, the median percent of returned pills was 3.0% and 2.6% in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. No participant had hydroxyurea therapy stopped for myelosuppression. For children with SCA in low-income settings without access to regular blood transfusion therapy, initial low-dose hydroxyurea is a minimum known efficacious dose for secondary stroke prevention.
32266061	What are the outcomes of core decompression in patients with avascular necrosis? Protocol for a systematic review.	Background: Core decompression is a hip preserving surgical procedure that is used to treat avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. The eventual clinical and radiological outcome following this procedure is varied in literature. Also, the time to a total hip replacement (THR) from the index procedure and the percentage of patients subsequently undergoing a THR is controversial. Furthermore, there are multiple surgical methods along with multiple augmentation techniques and various classification and staging systems described. The purpose of this systematic review, therefore, is to analyse the outcomes following decompression only, excluding any augmentation techniques for non-traumatic AVN of the femoral head. Methods: This protocol is being developed in line with the PRISMA-P guidelines. The search strategy includes articles from Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, CINHAL and Cochrane library. The review and screening will be done by two independent reviewers. Review articles, editorials and correspondences will be excluded. Articles including patients with sickle cell disease and with core decompression where augmentation is used will be excluded. The risk of bias and quality of articles will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for the different study designs included. Discussion: This study will be a comprehensive review on all published articles having patients with AVN of the femoral head and undergoing core decompression surgery only. The systematic review will then define the outcomes of the core decompression surgery based on clinical and radiological outcomes. Each outcome will include the different stages within it and finally, the total mean time to THR will be calculated. This will then be followed by assessing the cumulative confidence in evidence from all the data collected using the GRADE tool.   Registration: This systematic review is registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PROSPERO) under the registration number:  CRD42018100596.

32518950	Risk score to predict event-free survival after hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease.	We developed a risk score to predict event-free survival (EFS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease. The study population (n = 1425) was randomly split into training (n = 1070) and validation (n = 355) cohorts. Risk factors were identified and validated via Cox regression models. Two risk factors of 9 evaluated were predictive for EFS: age at transplantation and donor type. On the basis of the training cohort, patients age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched sibling donor were at the lowest risk with a 3-year EFS of 92% (score, 0). Patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched sibling donor or age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were at intermediate risk (3-year EFS, 87%; score, 1). All other groups, including patients of any age with a haploidentical relative or HLA-mismatched unrelated donor and patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were high risk (3-year EFS, 57%; score, 2 or 3). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. This simple risk score may guide patients with sickle cell disease and hematologists who are considering allogeneic transplantation as a curative treatment relative to other available contemporary treatments.
32929175	Pre-transplant myeloid and immune suppression, upfront plerixafor mobilization and post-transplant cyclophosphamide: novel strategy for haploidentical transplant in sickle cell disease.	Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative option for symptomatic sickle cell disease (SCD). HLA haploidentical related donor transplants are associated with high graft failure rates. We conceptualized a novel protocol (APOLLO protocol) using pre-transplant immune and myelosuppression (PTIS) using fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone followed by augmented John Hopkins protocol by adding thiotepa to conditioning. Twenty-five consecutive patients suffering from symptomatic SCD were enrolled into the study. We added upfront plerixafor to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) for mobilization of healthy donors. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was done using post-transplant cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Graft failure was not seen in any of our patients. Five patients developed acute grade II/IV GvHD (4 classical acute, 1 late onset), 3 had limited chronic GvHD. Out of 25 evaluable patients, 22 are alive and disease free, making an overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 88% with a median follow up of 485 days (range 198-802). T-cell-replete haploidentical transplant with PTIS, augmented John Hopkins conditioning and plerixafor based mobilization is a safe and effective way of treating patients suffering from SCD with minimal or no risk of graft failure and acceptable GvHD rates.

Liver transplantation in practicing Jehovah's Witnesses is challenging because of their religious beliefs preventing them from accepting allogenic blood products. Pegylated bovine carboxyhemoglobin (SANGUINATE) is an oxygen transfer agent, currently under investigation for the treatment of sickle cell disease, which may play a role in these patients by maximizing perioperative oxygen delivery. We report a case involving the use of SANGUINATE in a Jehovah's Witness undergoing liver transplant.

30768514	Extracorporeal Life Support for Severe Acute Chest Syndrome in Adult Sickle Cell Disease: A Preliminary Report.	OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support could be helpful for severe acute chest syndrome in adults sickle cell disease, because of the frequent hemodynamic compromise in this setting, including acute pulmonary vascular dysfunction and right ventricular failure. The aim of this study was to report the extracorporeal life support experience for severe acute chest syndrome in four referral centers in France. DESIGN: The primary endpoint of this multicentric retrospective study was ICU survival of patients with severe acute chest syndrome managed with extracorporeal life support. Secondary endpoints included comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. SETTING: We performed this study between January 2009 and July 2017 in four referral centers in France. PATIENTS: We included adult patients (age > 18 yr) with sickle cell disease, admitted for severe acute chest syndrome and who required extracorporeal life support during the ICU stay. INTERVENTIONS: The study was observational. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, 22 patients with sickle cell disease required extracorporeal life support for severe acute chest syndrome, including 10 (45%) veno-venous and 12 (55%) veno-arterial extracorporeal life support. In-ICU mortality was high (73%). Nonsurvivors had a higher severity at extracorporeal life support implantation, as assessed by their Vasoactive-Inotrope Score and number of organ failures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that outcome is impaired in sickle cell disease patients receiving extracorporeal life support while in severe multiple organ failure. Further studies are needed to evaluate selection criteria in this setting.
32889827	Role of complement in alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of complement in regulating the removal of a target alloantigen following an incompatible red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, the formation of alloantibodies following RBC alloantigen exposure, and the development of hyperhemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that complement can accelerate alloantibody-mediated removal of target alloantigens from the RBC surface following incompatible transfusion. Complement also influences alloantigen availability during developing alloimmune responses and serves as a unique mediator of CD4 T-cell-independent alloantibody formation following RBC alloantigen exposure. Finally, alternative complement pathway activation appears to play a key role in the development of acute hemolytic episodes in patients with SCD, providing a potential druggable target to prevent acute complications in patients with this disease. SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest that complement can regulate a wide variety of processes germane to hematology, from transfusion complications to baseline hemolysis in patients with SCD. As the role of complement in various disease processes becomes more fully understood, the ability to leverage recently developed complement modulating drugs will only continue to enhance providers' ability to favorably intervene in many hematological diseases.

The appropriate medical treatment includes hydration, analgesics, oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover atypical bacteria and transfusions or exchange transfusion.
32941305	Managing patients with sickle cell disease in primary care.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders affecting the hemoglobin in erythrocytes. SCD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and occurs most commonly among people of African ancestry. In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute updated its guidelines for the management of SCD. These guidelines were implemented to provide evidence-based recommendations to assist primary care clinicians in the proper management of patients with SCD. This article reviews the current practice guidelines for SCD, with attention to health maintenance and hydroxyurea.
29590553	Targeting pain at its source in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder associated with hemolytic anemia, end-organ damage, reduced survival, and pain. One of the unique features of SCD is recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vasoocclusive crisis requiring hospitalization. Additionally, patients with SCD often develop chronic persistent pain. Currently, sickle cell pain is treated with opioids, an approach limited by adverse effects. Because pain can start at infancy and continue throughout life, preventing the genesis of pain may be relatively better than treating the pain once it has been evoked. Therefore, we provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sickle cell pain that contribute to the activation of the somatosensory system in the peripheral and central nervous systems. These mechanisms include mast cell activation and neurogenic inflammation, peripheral nociceptor sensitization, maladaptation of spinal signals, central sensitization, and modulation of neural circuits in the brain. In this review, we describe potential preventive/therapeutic targets and their targeting with novel pharmacologic and/or integrative approaches to ameliorate sickle cell pain.
29794277	Low dose ketamine versus morphine for acute severe vaso occlusive pain in children: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute pain episodes associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are very difficult to manage effectively. Opioid tolerance and side effects have been major roadblocks in our ability to provide these patients with adequate pain relief. Ketamine is cheap, widely safe, readily available drug, with analgesic effects at sub-anesthetic doses and has been used in wide range of surgeries, pediatric burns dressing change and cancer related pain however, literature concerning its use in sickle cell crises is still limited in our setting. This study aimed to establish if 1 mg/kg of intravenous ketamine is non inferior to intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg in severe SCD-associated pain. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved randomized, prospective, double-blinded, active-control, non-inferiority trial at the national referral sickle cell center. Children between 7 and 18 years of age with severe painful sickle cell crisis, defined by numerical rating scale score of greater or equal to 7 were enrolled. Patients were consented and randomized to receive, either IV ketamine (LDK) 1 mg/kg or IV morphine (MOR) 0.1 mg/kg as an infusion over 10 min. The primary endpoint is maximal change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score. Secondary outcomes were, incidence of adverse effects, optimal time to and duration of action of ketamine and incidence of treatment failures by treatment group. A clinically meaningful difference in validated pain scores was defined as 1.3 units. Assuming both treatments are on average equal, a sample size of 240 patients (120 per group) provided 95% power to demonstrate that IV LDK is non-inferior to IV morphine with a 0.05 level of significance and a 10% non-inferiority margin. All analyses were based on a modified intention to treat. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT02434939. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty patients were enrolled (LDK120, MOR120). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (8.9 vs. 9.2) were similar. LDK was comparable to MOR in the maximum change in NRS scores, 66.4% vs. 61.3% (MD 5.5; 95% CI -2.2 to -13.2). Time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 19.8 min for LDK and 34.1 min for MOR. The average duration of action for LDK was 60 min. MOR had more patients still at maximum effect at 120 min (45.8% vs. 37.5%; RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.9-1.7). LDK patients were 11.3 times more likely to develop side effects, though were transient, anticipated and non-life threatening (37.5% vs. 3.3%). MOR had significantly more treatment failures 40% vs. 28.3% (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-1.03, p=0.07) Vital signs and sedation scores were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous LDK at 1 mg/kg provides comparable analgesic effectiveness as IV MOR in the acute treatment of severe painful sickle cell crisis in children in the day care sickle cell center. However, it is associated with a high incidence of several transient, non-life threatening mild side effects. IMPLICATIONS: Intravenous ketamine at 1 mg/kg can be a reliable alternative to morphine in the management of severe painful sickle cell crisis especially in a resource limited area where morphine is not readily available.
28026839	[Acute splenic sequestration in children with sickle cell disease--an overview].	Acute splenic sequestration in children with sickle cell disease - an overview Acute splenic sequestration (ASS) is a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). The condition is important to recognize due to the fact that it can occur with previously unknown disease. ASS is one of the most common causes of death in children with SCD and is the result of blood suddenly getting congested in the spleen, resulting in splenomegaly, acute anemia, and hypovolemic shock. Timely and appropriate treatment is essential in preventing death. Episodes of ASS before one year of age are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. There is no established effective treatment for recurrent ASS; however, there is evidence that all children with SCD should be treated with hydroxyurea. In Sweden, our recommendation is to evaluate the indications for splenectomy after the first episode of ASS. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment, and all children with SCD should be evaluated with regard to the potential success of HSCT. This article presents an overview of the condition with Swedish recommendations.
32462740	Vitamin D supplementation for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic chronic haemolytic and pro-inflammatory disorder. With increased catabolism and deficits in energy and nutrient intake, individuals with SCD suffer multiple macro- and micro-nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with SCD and to compare different dose regimens. To determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on general health (e.g. growth status and health-related quality of life), on musculoskeletal health (including bone mineral density, pain crises, bone fracture and muscle health), on respiratory health (including lung function, acute chest syndrome, acute exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infections) and the safety of vitamin D supplementation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 March 2020. We also searched database such as PubMed, clinical trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 14 January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing oral administration of any form of vitamin D supplementation at any dose and for any duration to another type or dose of vitamin D or placebo or no supplementation in people with SCD, of all ages, gender, and phenotypes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. They used the GRADE guidelines to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Vitamin D versus placebo One double-blind RCT (n = 39) compared oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (20 participants) to placebo (19 participants) for six weeks. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow-up. The study had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, but a low risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Vitamin D supplementation probably led to higher serum 25(OH)D levels at eight weeks, mean difference (MD) 29.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, MD 12.67 (95% CI 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, MD 15.52 (95% CI 13.50 to 17.54) (moderate-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% CI 0.14 to 72.84) (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation probably caused fewer pain days compared to the placebo group at eight weeks, MD -10.00 (95% CI -16.47 to -3.53) (low-quality evidence), but probably led to a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score (change from baseline in physical functioning PedsQL scores); at both 16 weeks, MD -12.56 (95% CI -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks, MD -12.59 (95% CI -17.43 to -7.76), although this may not be the case at eight weeks (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation regimens compared Two double-blind RCTs (83 participants) compared different regimens of vitamin D. One RCT (n = 62) compared oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks, while the second RCT (n = 21) compared oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month for 24 months. Both RCTs had low risk of bias for blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and incomplete outcome data, but the risk of selective outcome reporting bias was high. The bias from randomisation and allocation concealment was low in one study but not in the second. There was an unclear risk of other biases. When comparing oral vitamin D 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month, the higher dose may have resulted in higher serum 25(OH)D levels at one year, MD 16.40 (95% CI 12.59 to 20.21) and at two years, MD 18.96 (95% CI 15.20 to 22.72) (low-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events between doses (low-quality evidence). There were more episodes of acute chest syndrome in the high-dose group, at one year, MD 0.27 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.52) but there was little or no difference at two years, MD 0.09 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22) (moderate-quality evidence). At one year and two years there was also little or no difference between the doses in the presence of pain (moderate-quality evidence) or forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted. However, the high-dose group had lower values for % predicted forced vital capacity at both one and two years, MD -7.20% predicted (95% CI -14.15 to -0.25) and MD -7.10% predicted (95% CI -14.03 to -0.17), respectively. There were little or no differences between dose regimens in the muscle health of either hand or the dominant hand. The study comparing oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day (21 participants) did not provide data for analysis, but median serum 25(OH)D levels were reported to be lower in the low-dose group at both six and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks the median serum parathyroid hormone level was lower in the high-dose group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We included three RCTs of varying quality. We consider that the current evidence presented in this review is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D. Well-designed RCTs of parallel design, are required to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D supplementation as well as to assess the relative benefits of different doses in children and adults with SCD.

36400545	Allogeneic Transplant and Gene Therapy: Evolving Toward a Cure.	Curative therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) include allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- matched sibling and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), gene therapy, and gene editing. However, comparative trial data that might facilitate selecting one curative therapy over another are unavailable. New strategies to decrease graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks are needed to expand haploidentical HCT. Myeloablative gene therapy and gene editing also has limitations. Herein, we review recent studies on curative therapies for SCD in the past 5 years.
38553339	The acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease: What can be done to improve outcomes?	The acute pain crisis (APC) is the commonest complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Severe episodes may require treatment in hospital with strong opioid analgesic drugs, combined with additional supportive care measures. Guidelines for APC management have been produced over the past two decades gathering evidence from published studies, expert opinion, and patient perspective. Unfortunately, reports from multiple sources indicate that guidelines are often not followed, and that acute care in emergency departments and on acute medical wards is suboptimal. It is important to understand what leads to this breakdown in health care, and to identify evidence-based interventions which could be implemented to improve care. This review focuses on recently published articles as well as information about on-going clinical trials. Aspects of care which could potentially make a difference to patient experience include availability and accessibility of individual care plans agreed between patient and treating specialist, innovative means of delivering initial opioids to reduce time to first analgesia, and availability of a specialist unit away from the ED, where expert care can be delivered in a more compassionate environment. The current evidence of improved outcomes and health economic advantage with these interventions is inadequate, and this is hampering their implementation into health care systems.
33596221	Evidence-based interventions implemented in low-and middle-income countries for sickle cell disease management: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Despite ~90% of sickle cell disease (SCD) occurring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), the vast majority of people are not receiving evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to reduce SCD-related adverse outcomes and mortality, and data on implementation research outcomes (IROs) and SCD is limited. This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for SCD and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for SCD management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on SCD, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, patient/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in pain crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of malaria. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary arginine, citrulline, and daily chloroquine and hydroxyurea for SCD patients. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for SCD management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.
38477912	Consequence of RBC Deformability On Heat Sink Effect of Blood in a Three Dimensional Bifurcated Vessel.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of RBC shape and deformation on blood heat transfer of a tumor patient suffering from blood disorders when being treated with hyperthermia procedure. METHODS: Euler-Euler multiphase method along with granular model is used in this study to simulate blood flow in a bifurcated vessel. Kinetic theory is used to include particle nature of RBCs during blood flow in the current model. RESULTS: An increase of 0.25 K in blood temperature is noticed during a cardiac cycle for diseased patient compared to normal patient. These results indicate that blood disorders can alter the heat sink effect and blood heat transfer in a bifurcated vessel, which also affects the efficacy and efficiency of tumor treatment procedure. Hence, blood disorder (where the morphology of RBC is altered) of a patient needs to be taken into consideration when thermal therapy is being used for tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: Both spatial and transient Nusselt number of a normal patient is higher compared to a blood diseased patient which indicates a higher heat transfer in case of normal patient compared to the later, when treated with similar ablation procedure. So for a tumor patient suffering from blood disorder, modification in hyperthermia procedure needs to be done compared to a normal patient for complete infected cell necrosis and minimal destruction of healthy tissues.
33533039	Guideline on the peri-operative management of patients with sickle cell disease: Guideline from the Association of Anaesthetists.	Sickle cell disease is a multisystem disease characterised by chronic haemolytic anaemia, painful vaso-occlusive crises and acute and chronic end-organ damage. It is one of the most common serious inherited single gene conditions worldwide and has a major impact on the health of affected individuals. Peri-operative complications are higher in patients with sickle cell disease compared with the general population and may be sickle or non-sickle-related. Complications may be reduced by meticulous peri-operative care and transfusion, but unnecessary transfusion should be avoided, particularly to reduce the risk of allo-immunisation. Planned surgery and anaesthesia for patients with sickle cell disease should ideally be undertaken in centres with experience in caring for these patients. In an emergency, advice should be sought from specialists with experience in sickle cell disease through the haemoglobinopathy network arrangements. Emerging data suggest that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection but may have a relatively mild clinical course. Outcomes are determined by pre-existing comorbidities, as for the general population.
36992422	Gene Therapy for beta-Hemoglobinopathies: From Discovery to Clinical Trials.	Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the beta-globin gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent beta-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, both affecting functional beta-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient's own HSPCs, broadening access to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for beta-thalassemia (Zynteglo ). This review illuminates the beta-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the beta-globin locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.
34002408	Screening for new red blood cell alloantibodies after transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are frequent recipients of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and are at risk for RBC alloimmunization. RBC alloimmunization is diagnosed by identifying RBC alloantibodies as part of pre-transfusion testing, but this testing fails to detect alloantibodies that have evanesced. It may be beneficial to screen for new RBC alloantibody development after transfusion before possible antibody evanescence. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our institution started a new initiative for episodically transfused patients with SCD to obtain at least one antibody screen 2-6 months after transfusion as part of their clinical care. A database was created to prospectively track all transfused patients for 1 year and their post-transfusion antibody screen results. Patients received prophylactically CEK-matched RBC units. RESULTS: During the study year, 138 patients with SCD received a total of 242 RBC transfusions. Patients with a history of an RBC alloantibody (n = 13, 9.4%) had previously received more RBC units than non alloimmunized patients (median 11 vs. 2 RBC units, p = .0002). A total of 337 post-transfusion antibody screens were obtained in 127 patients (92.0%) with 110 patients (79.7%) having at least one antibody screen 2-6 months post-transfusion. With this prospective testing, two new RBC alloantibodies (anti-C and -M) were identified in two patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to test for new RBC alloantibody development in most episodically transfused patients with SCD as part of their routine care. The yield of this screening appears low with CEK matching, but it could still provide important information for individual patients.
34981707	Liver Transplant in Hemoglobin SC Disease and Autoimmune Hepatitis: A Case Report.	Although liver transplant is a life-saving measure for individuals with end-stage liver disease, the perioperative management may be challenging in individuals with concomitant sickle cell disease. We report a case of a 50-year-old man with sickle cell disease genotype SC (HbSC) and cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis who underwent liver transplant. His postoperative course included upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke via a patent foramen ovale after a line removal, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Fortunately, he is alive with a functioning graft at 10 months after liver transplant. This case highlights the feasibility of liver transplant in sickle cell disease given the support of meticulous multidisciplinary care and the unique aspects of autoimmune hepatitis and sickle cell disease for liver transplant consideration.
29882519	Emphysematous osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella typhi in beta thalassemia major.	There have been various cases of salmonella osteomyelitis reported in sickle cell anemia. We present a case of emphysematous osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella typhi in a 29-year-old beta thalassemia major patient. Diagnosis of emphysematous osteomyelitis was confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and culture of pus drained during surgical debridement confirmed the causative microorganism, Salmonella typhi. Antimicrobials were given according to microbiological sensitivity for a period of 8 weeks. Our patient also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At the end of therapy, he was afebrile and laboratory parameters normalized with a residual joint deformity which developed within 3 months.
29359261	Transplantation in patients with iron overload: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging? : Transplantation in iron overload.	In iron overload diseases (thalassemia, sickle cell, and myelodysplastic syndrome), iron is deposited in all internal organs, leading to functional abnormalities. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment offering a potential cure in these diseases. Our aim was to describe the experience in the field and the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of iron overload before and after HSCT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using T2*, is the most commonly used tool to diagnose myocardial-liver iron overload and guide tailored treatment. Currently, HSCT offers complete cure in thalassemia major, after overcoming the immunologic barrier, and should be considered for all patients who have a suitable donor. The overall thalassemia-free survival of low-risk, HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation patients is 85-90%, with a 95% overall survival. The problems of rejection and engraftment are improving with the use of adequate immunosuppression. However, a detailed iron assessment of both heart and liver is necessary for pre- and post-transplant evaluation. In iron overload diseases, heart and liver iron evaluation is indispensable not only for the patients' survival, but also for evaluation before and after HSCT.
33275672	Optimizing the management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease.	Chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to pain present on most days lasting over six months. It can start during childhood and the prevalence increases with age. By adulthood, over 55% of patients experience pain on over 50% of days; 29% reporting pain on 95% of days. The true prevalence of chronic pain in SCD is likely underappreciated as it is mostly managed at home. Patients with chronic pain and SCD frequently seek acute care for exacerbation of underlying chronic pain difficult to distinguish from their usual acute vaso-occlusive crises. When treating chronic pain in SCD, the challenge is distinguishing between non-SCD related etiologies versus chronic pain resulting from SCD pathophysiological processes. This distinction is important to delineate as it will drive appropriate management strategies. Chronic pain in SCD has profound consequences for the patient; is often associated with comorbid psychiatric illnesses (depression and anxiety), not dissimilar from other chronic pain syndromes. They may also experience challenges with sleep hygiene, various somatic symptoms, and chronic fatigue that impair quality of life. How best to treat chronic pain in SCD is not definitively established. Both acute and chronic pain in SCD is typically treated with opioids. Emerging data suggests that chronic opioid therapy (COT) is a suboptimal treatment strategy for chronic pain. This review will discuss the complexity of managing chronic pain in SCD; pain that may be dependent or independent of the underlying SCD diagnosis. We will also describe alternative treatment approaches to high-dose COT.

34042406	Towards manufactured red blood cells for the treatment of inherited anemia.	Patients with inherited anemia and hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) are treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to alleviate their symptoms. Some of these patients may have rare blood group types or go on to develop alloimmune reactions, which can make it difficult to source compatible blood in the donor population. Laboratory-grown RBC represent a particularly attractive alternative which could satisfy an unmet clinical need. The challenge, however, is to produce - from a limited number of stem cells - the 2x1012 RBC required for a standard adult therapeutic dose. Encouraging progress has been made in RBC production from adult stem cells under good manufacturing practice. In 2011, the Douay group conducted a successful proof-of-principle mini-transfusion of autologous manufactured RBC in a single volunteer. In the UK, a trial is planned to assess whether manufactured RBC are equivalent to RBC produced naturally in donors, by testing an allogeneic mini-dose of laboratory-grown manufactured RBC in multiple volunteers. This review discusses recent progress in the erythroid culture field as well as opportunities for further scaling up of manufactured RBC production for transfusion practice.
33496753	A systematic review of quality of life in sickle cell disease and thalassemia after stem cell transplant or gene therapy.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia experience several complications across their lifespan that lead to impairment in different health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains. There is increasing interest in curative therapies for patients with SCD and thalassemia, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy; however, the effect of these therapies on various HRQOL domains remains unclear. Our objective was to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for the effect of HSCT and gene therapy on HRQOL in patients with SCD and thalassemia. A systematic search of medical literature databases was conducted. A total of 16 studies (thalassemia, n = 9; SCD, n = 6; both, n = 1) involving 517 participants met inclusion criteria (thalassemia, n = 416; SCD, n = 101). HSCT was associated with a small to large positive effects in most HRQOL domains (Cohen's d; mean = 0.47; median = 0.37; range, 0.27-2.05). In thalassemia, HSCT was frequently associated with large positive effects in physical and emotional HRQOL domains (median d = 0.79 and d = 0.57, respectively). In SCD, HSCT was associated with large positive effects in all HRQOL domains. Emerging data suggest improvement in HRQOL outcomes across different domains following gene therapy in thalassemia and SCD. The quality of evidence was moderate in 13 studies (81%). HSCT has a positive impact on several HRQOL domains in patients with SCD and thalassemia; however, more longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the sustainability of these effects. Reporting HRQOL outcomes from ongoing gene therapy or gene-editing trials in SCD and thalassemia is key to better understand the benefits of such therapies.
29357947	Overnight auto-adjusting continuous airway pressure + standard care compared with standard care alone in the prevention of morbidity in sickle cell disease phase II (POMS2b): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: In addition to pain, sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) complications include neurocognitive difficulties in attention and processing speed associated with low daytime and night-time oxygen saturation compounded by obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In the general population OSA is treated with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP). The aim of this single-blind, randomised, controlled phase II trial is to compare auto-adjusting CPAP (APAP) with standard care to standard care alone in individuals with HbSS to determine whether the intervention improves attention and processing speed, brain structure, pain and quality of life. METHODS/DESIGN: Eligibility criteria include: ability to provide informed consent; age > 8 years; diagnosis of HbSS; and mean overnight saturation of < 90% for < 30% of the night (i.e. not meeting current criteria for overnight oxygen therapy). Key exclusion criteria are: overnight respiratory support; respiratory or decompensated cardiac failure; chronic transfusion; or contraindications to APAP therapy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixty individuals with HbSS (30 children and 30 adults) will be randomised to standard care + APAP or standard care alone for six months. Minimisation factors are: age group (8-11, 12-15, 16-22 and > 23 years); silent infarction on MRI; minimum overnight oxygen saturation > 90% or < 90%; and hydroxyurea use. For APAP individuals, the intervention is administered at home. Adherence and effectiveness are recorded using software documenting hours of use each night and overnight oximetry. Participant support in terms of appropriate facemask and facilitating adherence are provided by an unblinded sleep physiologist. The primary outcome is change in the cancellation subtest from the Wechsler scales. Secondary outcomes include general cognitive functioning, quantitative brain MRI, blood and urine chemistry, quality of life and daily pain via a smartphone App (GoMedSolutions, Inc) and, where possible MRI heart, echocardiography, and 6-min walk. These outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after six months of treatment by assessors blind to treatment assignment. DISCUSSION: Altering oxygen saturation in HbSS may lead to bone marrow suppression. This risk will be reduced by monitoring full blood counts at baseline, two weeks, three months and six months, providing treatment as appropriate and reporting as safety events. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN46012373 . Registered on 10 July 2015. Protocol Version: 6.0 Date: 24th December 2015 Sponsor: University Hospital Southampton. Sponsor's protocol code: RHMCHIOT53.
30700461	Gross anterior segment ischaemia following vitreoretinal surgery for sickle-cell retinopathy.	We report the case of a 32-year-old Afrocaribbean man with known stage 3 proliferative sickle-cell retinopathy who presented with a mixed picture of tractional and rhegmatogenous macula off detachment. He underwent left primary 25 g vitrectomy with silicone oil, delamination and endolaser photocoagulation under a general anaesthetic. He, however, presented 48 hours postoperatively with gross anterior segment ischaemia. His pain and ocular signs settled over the course of a few days following administration of supplemental oxygen, oral steroids, analgesia and intravenous hydration. Examination showed resolution of his proptosis and orbital signs as well as anterior segment inflammation. He remains under follow-up.
32853076	Sickle Cell-Related Complications in Patients Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe our experience with patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) and undergoing surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: Data on all patients with SCT or sickle-alpha thalassemia who underwent surgery on CPB were collected (1996-2017). RESULTS: Overall, 46 patients were included, 37 (80%) had SCT and 9 (20%) had sickle-alpha thalassemia. A total of 4 (9%) developed a potential sickle cell-related complication. Patients with sickle cell-related complications were significantly older (median 14 years vs 14 months, P = .037) and heavier (median 54 kg vs 9 kg, P = .041). Complications occurred, although without statistical significance, in patients who underwent longer median CPB times (249 minutes vs 137 minutes, P = .069), lower median temperature (31.7  C vs 33.3  C, P = .094), and a higher percentage underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (50% vs 7%, P = .053). A total of 30 (65%) patients underwent exchange transfusion (ET) pre-bypass. Patients who underwent ET were significantly older (median 4 years vs 7 months, P = .003) and heavier (median 16 kg vs 6 kg, P = .015) than patients who did not undergo ET. The incidence of complications was comparable between patients who underwent ET (10%) and those who did not (6%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, single-center study, it has been shown that cardiac surgery requiring CPB in patients with SCT and sickle-alpha thalassemia had a low risk for sickle cell-associated complications. In this cohort of patients, older age, longer CPB times, lower median temperature, and the utilization of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest appear to play an important role in the development of complications.
28697028	Sciatic (Popliteal Fossa) Catheter for Pediatric Pain Management of Sickle Cell Crisis: A Case Report.	Sickle cell crisis, or vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is a major cause of hospitalizations for adults and children with sickle cell disease, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite prompt pharmacological treatment and multimodal pain management, acute pain during a VOC is often not adequately controlled in the pediatric population. We placed a continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block under ultrasound guidance in a pediatric patient for localized refractory pain during a VOC, resulting in improved pain control with preserved sensorimotor function.

28870775	Ethical Challenges in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using an HLA-identical sibling donor offers a very high likelihood of cure with good outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), and alternative donor HCT for SCD is an area of active clinical research. Thus, HCT is a potential option for a growing number of patients with SCD. This expanded use of HCT has raised several ethical questions. Who is eligible for HCT, in terms of both disease severity and psychosocial factors? Should affected children with matched sibling donors undergo HCT only when they have declared themselves as having significant symptomatology? Regarding donors, special ethical challenges include the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to conceive an HLA-identical sibling. In this review, we critically analyze various ethical challenges related to HCT for SCD, and offer recommendations to guide clinical care.

32283959	Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: a Single-Center Experience.	Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult patients with sickle cell disease represents a leading cause of death. It is characterized by a new density on chest X-ray accompanied by fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Currently, 49 adult patients with sickle cell disease are registered at our department. By now, 12 patients (24.5%) suffered from ACS and two patients showed multiple/recurrent (>2) episodes. Death in one patient was related to acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. In three patients with ACS, invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was mandatory. Veno-venous ECMO was applied within 24 hours upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU). All patients were treated aggressively for ACS including exchange transfusions [packed red blood cell (pRBC) units 5-16] maintaining a Hb S threshold of <30.0% in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics, resulting in a successful outcome following decannulation from VV-ECMO (49 hours, 251 hours, 30 min., and 98 hours, respectively). Limited information is presently available on the use of VV-ECMO in adult patients with sickle cell disease in the context of acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. The adequate timing of the decision to place ECMO in critically ill adults with sickle cell disease, incapable of being treated by conventional mechanical ventilation secondary to very severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), might further reduce mortality rates while treating the underlying condition.
28672087	Interventions for chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD.Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD.Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, and increases in prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of any intervention in preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with SCD (including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)), either alone or in combination with each other. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 05 April 2016. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 13 April 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials with 215 participants. One trial was published in 2011 and included 193 children aged 9 months to 18 months, and compared treatment with hydroxyurea to placebo. The second trial was published in 1998 and included 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared ACEI to placebo.We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials having: a high or unclear risk of bias including attrition and detection bias; indirectness (the available evidence was for children aged 9 months to 18 months in one trial and a small and select adult sample size in a second trial); and imprecise outcome effect estimates of significant benefit or harm. Hydroxyurea versus placebo We are very uncertain if hydroxyurea reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease (assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate), or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged 9 to 18 months, mean difference (MD) 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76 (mL/min per 1.73 m2)) (one study; 142 participants; very low-quality evidence).In children aged 9 to 18 months, hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine, MD 42.23 (95% CI 12.14 to 72.32 (mOsm/kg)) (one study; 178 participants; low-quality evidence).Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events including: incidence of acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.39 (99% CI 0.13 to 1.16); painful crisis, RR 0.68 (99% CI 0.45 to 1.02); and hospitalisations, RR 0.83 (99% CI 0.68 to 1.01) (one study, 193 participants; low-quality evidence).No deaths occurred in the trial. Quality of life was not reported. ACEI versus placeboWe are very uncertain if ACEI reduces proteinuria in adults with SCD who have normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, MD -49.00 (95% CI -124.10 to 26.10 (mg per day)) (one study; 22 participants; very low-quality evidence). We are very uncertain if ACEI reduce or prevent kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance. The authors state that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but no comparative data were provided (very low-quality evidence).All-cause mortality, serious adverse events and quality of life were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In young children aged 9 months to 18 months, we are very uncertain if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration, but it may improve young children's ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference on the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises and hospitalisations.We are very uncertain if giving ACEI to adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications.This review identified no trials that looked at red cell transfusions nor any combinations of interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on the management of either children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD.We have identified a lack of adequately-designed and powered studies, and no ongoing trials which address this critical question. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEI or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction kidney complications in people with SCD.
37227254	An innovative intervention for the prevention of vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a mutation in the beta-globin gene resulting in abnormal hemoglobin S (HgbS). The significant sequela of SCD include anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) which may effectuate patients to receive chronic blood transfusions. Current pharmacotherapy options for SCD include hydroxyurea, voxelotor, Lglutamine, and crizanlizumab. Simple and exchange transfusions are often utilized as prophylaxis to prevent emergency department (ED)/urgent care (UC) visits or hospitalizations from VOEs by reducing the level of sickled red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, the treatment of VOEs involves intravenous (IV) hydration and pain management. Studies have demonstrated that sickle cell infusion centers (SCIC) decrease hospital admissions for VOEs, and IV hydration and pain medications are the key components of management employed. Thus, we hypothesized that implementing a structured infusion protocol in the outpatient setting would reduce the incidence of VOEs. METHODS: Here, we discuss two patients with SCD who were trialed on scheduled outpatient IV hydration and opioids with the goal of decreasing the frequency of VOEs in the setting of the current blood product shortage and the patients' refusal to receive exchange transfusions. RESULTS: Overall, the two patients had opposing outcomes- one demonstrated reduced frequency of VOEs, whereas the other had mixed results due to noncompliance to scheduled outpatient sessions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of outpatient SCICs may be an effective intervention for prevention of VOEs in patients with SCD, and further patient-centered research and quality improvement initiatives are needed to further quantify and understand the factors contributing to their efficacy.
29727586	Efficacy and safety of iron chelators in thalassemia and sickle cell disease: a multiple treatment comparison network meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.	BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP), deferasirox (DFX) and silymarin in patients with either thalassemia or sickle cell disorder through network meta-analysis. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for appropriate randomized clinical trials comparing iron chelators in patients with iron overload. Random effects model was used to generate direct, indirect and mixed treatment comparison pooled estimates for the following outcomes: serum ferritin, liver iron concentration (LIC), changes in serum ferritin, mortality, urine iron excretion, adverse events, neutropenia, agranulocytosis and number of patients withdrawing the chelating therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-two clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis. DFX/DFO was associated with better serum ferritin levels compared to DFO, DFX, DFO/Silymarin and DFP/DFO. DFX/DFO also lower LIC significantly compared to DFO. DFP/DFO was associated with higher LVEF, low risk of adverse events and reduced end of serum ferritin compared to DFO. Combination of silymarin with either DFP or DFX was observed with reduced end of treatment serum ferritin compared to using either of the drugs alone. DFP was observed with better effects in sickle cell disease. The strength of evidence was very low for most of the comparisons. CONCLUSION: Relative estimates between the individual iron chelators have been established. However, this evidence should be considered preliminary and may change with the results of future head-to-head clinical trials.
31319882	Prevention of Morbidity in Sickle Cell Disease (POMS2a)-overnight auto-adjusting continuous positive airway pressure compared with nocturnal oxygen therapy: a randomised crossover pilot study examining patient preference and safety in adults and children.	DESIGN: This randomised crossover trial compared nocturnal auto-adjusting continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) and nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia, with patient acceptability as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included pulmonary physiology (adults), safety, and daily pain during interventions and washout documented using tablet technology. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age > 8 years and the ability to use an iPad to collect daily pain data. Trial participation was 4 weeks; week 1 involved baseline data collection and week 3 was a washout between interventions, which were administered for 7 days each during weeks 2 and 4 in a randomised order. Qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed for content using a funnelling technique, starting generally and then gaining more detailed information on the experience of both interventions. Safety data included routine haematology and median pain days between each period. Missing pain day values were replaced using multiple imputation. RESULTS: Ten adults (three female, median age 30.2 years, range 18-51.5 years) and eleven children (five female, median age 12 years, range 8.7-16.9 years) enrolled. Nine adults and seven children completed interviews. Qualitative data revealed that the APAP machine was smaller, easier to handle, and less noisy. Of 16 participants, 10 preferred APAP (62.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 38.6-81.5%). Haemoglobin decreased from baseline on APAP and NOT (mean difference -3.2 g/L (95% CI -6.0 to -0.2 g/L) and -2.5 g/L (95% CI -4.6 to 0.3 g/L), respectively), but there was no significant difference between interventions (NOT versus APAP, 1.1 (-1.2 to 3.6)). Pulmonary function changed little. Compared with baseline, there were significant decreases in the median number of pain days (1.58 for APAP and 1.71 for NOT) but no significant difference comparing washout with baseline. After adjustment for carry-over and period effects, there was a non-significant median difference of 0.143 (95% CI -0.116 to 0.401) days additional pain with APAP compared with NOT. CONCLUSION: In view of the point estimate of patient preference for APAP, and no difference in haematology or pulmonary function or evidence that pain was worse during or in washout after APAP, it was decided to proceed with a Phase II trial of 6 months APAP versus standard care with further safety monitoring for bone marrow suppression and pain.

32157246	The role of HLA matching in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in Europe.	We report the results of an analysis of unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) in 71 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) transplanted in EBMT centers between 2005 and 2017. Median age was 9.3 years; graft type was bone marrow in 79% and peripheral blood in 21%. Recipient-donor HLA match at high resolution typing was 10/10 in 31, 9/10 in 20, and 8/10 in 4 patients; the other patients had intermediate resolution typing. The most frequent conditioning regimens were fludarabine-thiotepa-treosulfan (64%) or busulfan-cyclophosphamide (12%). Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 92%; platelet engraftment was 90%. Eleven patients (15%) experienced graft failure. Grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) was 23%; 3-year chronic GvHD was 23%. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 88 +- 4%. GRFS was 62 +- 6%. HLA matching was the most significant risk factor for OS: 3-year OS was 96 +- 4% in 10/10 group vs. 75 +- 10% in 9-8/10 (p = 0.042); GRFS was 69 +- 9% vs. 50 +- 12% (p = 0.114), respectively. In conclusion, unrelated donor HSCT is a valid option for SCD patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor, preferably in the context of clinical trials. Using a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor yields better survival indicating that HLA matching is an important donor selection factor in this nonmalignant disease.
37939877	Sickle cell disease and pregnancy.	Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.
32367178	Outcomes related to intravenous fluid administration in sickle cell patients during vaso-occlusive crisis.	While fluid replacement therapy is a primary treatment modality used in vaso-occlusive crises for sickle cell disease, data is limited on its safety, efficacy, and variability. We performed a retrospective analysis on 157 unique patient encounters from 49 sickle cell patients hospitalized with a vaso-occlusive episode at our institution from 2013 to 2017. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 2-7). The mean total amount of intravenous fluid administered during the hospitalization was 7.4 L (Std 9.6). The mean total amount of fluid intake including intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and oral fluids was 14.2 L (Std 18.2). Multivariate analyses revealed significant associations between the development of any adverse event (including a new oxygen requirement, acute chest syndrome, aspiration event, other hospital-acquired infection, acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit transfer) and the following variables: intravenous fluid administered in the first 24 h (p = 0.001, OR 1.899, 95% CI 1.319-2.733), total amount of intravenous fluid administered (p = 0.005, OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.023-1.141), and total amount of fluid intake including oral fluids, blood transfusions, and intravenous fluids (p = 0.009, OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.011-1.081). Other factors found to be significantly associated with any adverse event were dialysis dependence prior to admission (p < 0.001, OR 12.984, 95% CI 3.660-46.056) and admission to an inpatient service versus an emergency room or observation unit (p = 0.008, OR 3.201, 95% CI 1.346-7.612). While fluid administration may theoretically slow the sickling process, this data suggests that fluid administration during a vaso-occlusive episode, and especially total volume given in the first 24 h, may also lead to adverse events.
28506281	A telephonic mindfulness-based intervention for persons with sickle cell disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult symptoms for persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) to manage is chronic pain. Chronic pain impacts approximately one-third of persons with SCD and is associated with increased pain intensity, pain behavior, and frequency and duration of hospital visits. A promising category of nonpharmacological interventions for managing both physical and affective components of pain are mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). METHODS/DESIGN: The primary aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility, as well as to determine the preliminary efficacy, of a telephonic MBI for adults with SCD who have chronic pain. We will enroll 60 adult patients with SCD and chronic pain at an outpatient comprehensive SCD center in the southeastern United States. Patients will be randomized to either an MBI or a wait-listed control group. The MBI group will complete a six-session (60 minutes), telephonically delivered, group-based MBI program. The feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the MBI regarding pain catastrophizing will be assessed by administering questionnaires at baseline and weeks 1, 3, and 6. In addition, ten randomly selected MBI participants will complete semistructured interviews to help determine intervention acceptability. DISCUSSION: In this study protocol, we report detailed methods of the randomized controlled trial. Findings of this study will be useful to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an MBI for persons with SCD and chronic pain.

28977106	Daily use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors as prevention for recurrent priapism.	OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of recurrent priapism is currently being investigated based on the regulation of the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) enzyme. We explored the daily use of PDE5 inhibitors to treat and prevent priapism recurrences. METHOD: We administered PDE5 inhibitors using a long-term therapeutic regimen in seven men with recurrent priapism, with a mean age of 29.2 years (range 21 to 35 years). Six men (85.7%) had idiopathic priapism recurrences and one man (24.3%) had sickle cell disease-associated priapism recurrences. Tadalafil 5 mg was administered daily. The mean follow-up was 6.6 months (range 3 to 12 months). RESULTS: Daily long-term oral PDE5 inhibitor therapy alleviated priapism recurrences in all patients. Five (71.4%) had no episodes of priapism and two (28.6%) referred decrease in their episodes of priapism. All patients referred improvement in erectile function. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the hypothesis that PDE5 dysregulation exerts a pathogenic role for both sickle cell disease-associated priapism and for idiopathic priapism, and that it offers a molecular target for the therapeutic management of priapism. These preliminary observations suggest that continuous long-term oral PDE5 inhibitor therapy may treat and prevent recurrent priapism.

34396933	Refractory acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a patient with sickle cell trait successfully treated with caplacizumab.	Methods: We report a case of a 20-year-old Nigerian male who presented with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) and sickle cell trait. The coexistence of published cases of TTP and sickle cell hemoglobinopathies is rare.Results: Despite the initial treatment with plasma exchange and glucocorticoids, our patient relapsed and also required caplacizumab which resulted in successful remission.Discussion: We conclude by reviewing the cases of TTP in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and review how vaso-occlusive crises with multiorgan injury can mimic TTP.Conclusion: Ours is the first published case of aTTP with confirmed ADAMTS13 autoantibodies in a patient with a sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and contributes to the literature on the successful use of caplacizumab in clinical practice.
36191299	Subanesthetic ketamine: the way forward for pain management in sickle cell disease patients?	INTRODUCTION: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) present recurrent episodes of acute pain, the hallmark of the disease, and some will also develop chronic pain. Currently, the treatment of SCD acute pain only targets its symptoms, rather than underlying mechanisms, and is directed by expert and consensus guidelines. AREAS COVERED: While opioids remain the mainstay of therapy for acute pain and are also used to treat SCD-related chronic pain, in some patients, opioids are ineffective or are associated with severe undesirable side effects. In those instances, clinicians caring for patients with SCD face an unmet need for effective non-opioid analgesics. Recently, the use of subanesthetic ketamine has been explored as a strategy to meet this need. While definitive evidence of its efficacy is lacking, some information exists suggesting that subanesthetic ketamine improves pain control and may have opioid-sparing effects in SCD-related acute pain. However, ketamine can also yield undesirable psychotomimetic and cardiovascular effects. EXPERT OPINION: After weighing potential risks and benefits, in the absence of better alternatives and in settings where it can be administered safely, ketamine may be a reasonable option for patients with SCD-related acute refractory pain.
29668544	Splenectomy to Optimize Hemoglobin S Control in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia on Chronic Transfusion Therapy for Stroke Prevention.	Chronic transfusion therapy with the goal of maintaining a hemoglobin (Hb) S <30% is the primary recommended treatment for children with sickle cell anemia and a history of overt stroke or abnormal transcranial Doppler examination. We report chronic hypersplenism as a cause of poor HbS% control in 3 children on chronic transfusion therapy for stroke prevention. Splenectomy resulted in a 39.77% (95% confidence interval, 34.3-45.3, P<0.0001) mean reduction in HbS% with no perioperative or infectious complications suggesting the need for additional research into splenectomy as a therapeutic option for select high-risk children to optimize transfusion therapy for stroke prevention.
32312326	Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: Pregnancies in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated with a higher risk of sickle and pregnancy complications. Limited options exist for treating SCD during pregnancy. Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) has been shown to be effective in treating SCD outside pregnancy, but evidence is lacking regarding its use during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future phase 3 randomised controlled trial (RCT) to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of SPEBT in pregnant women with SCD. METHODS: The study is an individually randomised, two-arm, feasibility trial with embedded qualitative and health economic studies. Fifty women, 18 years of age and older, with SCD and a singleton pregnancy at <= 18 weeks' gestation will be recruited from six hospitals in England. Randomisation will be conducted using a secure online database and minimised by centre, SCD genotype and maternal age. Women allocated to the intervention arm will receive SPEBT commencing at <= 18 weeks' gestation, performed using automated erythrocytapheresis every 6-10 weeks until the end of pregnancy, aiming to maintain HbS% or combined HbS/HbC% below 30%. Women in the standard care arm will only receive transfusion when clinically indicated. The primary outcome will be the recruitment rate. Additional endpoints include reasons for refusal to participate, attrition rate, protocol adherence, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Women will be monitored throughout pregnancy to assess maternal, sickle, and foetal complications. Detailed information about adverse events (including hospital admission) and birth outcomes will be extracted from medical records and via interview at 6 weeks postpartum. An embedded qualitative study will consist of interviews with (a) 15-25 trial participants to assess experiences and acceptability, (b) 5-15 women who decline to participate to identify barriers to recruitment and (c) 15-20 clinical staff to explore fidelity and acceptability. A health economic study will inform a future cost effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. DISCUSSION: This feasibility study aims to rigorously evaluate SPEBT as a treatment for SCD in pregnancy and its impact on maternal and infant outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NIH registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov), registration number NCT03975894 (registered 05/06/19); ISRCTN (www.isrctn.com), registration number ISRCTN52684446 (retrospectively registered 02/08/19).
34983921	Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Transfusion therapy has a well-established role in the management of several sickle cell disease (SCD)-related complications. Nevertheless, the benefits of transfusion must outweigh the possible risks, including iron overload, infections, and transfusion reactions. Alloimmunization is the underlying etiology of most delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). DHTR is often underestimated and underdiagnosed in sickle cell disease patients as it mimics a vaso-occlusive crisis in presentation. Alloimmunization to RBC antigens can be a serious complication of transfusion, which is of particular interest in individuals with SCD, as the occurrence rate is higher in this population. This complication represents a secondary immunological phenomenon that typically arises after the emergence of an alloantibody to which the patient had been previously sensitized to. CASE REPORT Here, we report 2 cases of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) in which the patients showed evidence of alloimmunization from previous blood transfusions. The patients were managed with a variety of medications, including supportive treatments, utilization of immunosuppressive agents, and enhancement of erythropoiesis. Both patients had evidence of clinical and laboratory improvement following the management. CONCLUSIONS DHTR is considered one of the most deleterious complications of transfusion in SCD patients. The diagnosis and management of DHTR is very challenging, especially because it can present differently in this population. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in addition to the laboratory criteria.

32735379	Vaso-occlusive crisis in a sickle cell patient after transfusion-transmitted dengue infection.	CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old woman with sickle cell disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy complained of severe arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, and fever 24 hours after transfusion of a red blood cells (RBCs). Dengue virus (DENV) infection was suspected and the patient was hospitalized for clinical support and RBC transfusion, to lower the hemoglobin S to less than 30%. The patient's clinical condition improved approximately 8 days after the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: DENV type 2 (DENV-2) TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction was negative in the patient's pretransfusion sample while the posttransfusion sample was positive (Ct, 27.8), suggesting a high viral load and an acute infection. To investigate DENV transfusion transmission (TT-DENV) the stored donor serum was tested and was also positive (Ct, 25.8). Molecular typing confirmed the presence of DENV-2. The phylogenetic analysis of the DENV-2 strains obtained from both donor and patient samples were classified as the Southeast Asia-American genotype (Genotype III) and demonstrated 100% genomic identity, indicating TT-DENV. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of TT-DENV in a SCD patient. A presumed high viral load in the transfused RBC unit probably determined the early clinical manifestation. In endemic regions dengue fever should be considered as differential diagnosis in SCD patients with fever and acute pain crisis, mainly during DENV outbreaks.
32765834	Drug Therapies for the Management of Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) afflicts millions of people worldwide but is referred to as an orphan disease in the United States. Over the past several decades, there has been an increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications. While most individuals with SCD in resource-rich countries survive into adulthood, the life expectancy of patients with SCD remains substantially shorter than for the general African-American population. SCD can be cured using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy, but these treatment approaches are not available to most patients, the majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries. Until relatively recently, only one drug, hydroxyurea, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to ameliorate disease severity. Multiple other drugs (L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor) have recently been approved for the treatment of SCD, with several others at various stages of clinical testing. The availability of multiple agents to treat SCD raises questions related to the choice of appropriate drug therapy, combination of multiple agents, and affordability of recently approved products. The enthusiasm for new drug development provides opportunities to involve patients in low- and middle-income nations in the testing of potentially disease-modifying therapies and has the potential to contribute to capacity building in these environments. Demonstration that these agents, alone or in combination, can prevent or decrease end-organ damage would provide additional evidence for the role of drug therapies in improving outcomes in SCD.
37046407	Feasibility study of busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantationfor children and young adults with nonmalignant disorders.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for several pediatric non-malignant disorders. A widely used conditioning backbone is busulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). Thiotepa has improved engraftment when added to this regimen, however the minimum effective dose (MED) of thiotepa to achieve engraftment while minimizing toxicities has not been well established. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this prospective feasibility study was to determine the MED of thiotepa (5mg/kg) in combination with reduced-dose busulfan, fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, and rATG required to achieve engraftment in >90% of HSCT recipients for non-malignant disorders with acceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Six patients who received fully matched HSCT were enrolled. Patient diagnoses included Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 1), CD40L deficiency (n = 1), sickle cell disease (n = 2), autoinflammatory syndrome (n = 1), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 1). All six patients achieved engraftment prior to Day +42 and five patients had stable full donor engraftment. Two of the six patients (33%) developed acute GVHD and/or chronic GHVD, both of whom had sickle cell disease. At a median follow-up of 2.25 years post-transplant, all patients were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Three out of six patients (50%) developed grade 3 adverse events. Neurocognitive functioning of children under 10 years of age was not adversely affected by this regimen. CONCLUSION: This approach shows acceptable toxicity and reliable engraftment in children with non-malignant disorders receiving related or unrelated HLA-matched transplants.
33601015	Integrative holistic approaches for children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease: A single center experience.	CONTEXT: Painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common cause of morbidity, hospitalizations, and poor quality of life. Additional symptoms such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and stress are also common. Non-traditional approaches are often used by families, but concerns remain that patients may forgo standard of care effective therapies in favor of dangerous unproven alternatives. OBJECTIVES: To describe a single center experience related to a multidisciplinary integrative medicine clinic within the division of hematology dedicated to children and young adults with SCD. METHODS: The Sickle Cell Integrative Clinic at Children's National Hospital services patients with SCD. The main goal of this clinic is to provide access to non-pharmacologic interventions, and to manage patients' symptoms in a holistic manner along with standard of care management of SCD. This IRB approved study evaluated experiences of both patients and parents who attended this clinic. RESULTS: Thirty-seven unique patients attended this clinic over 2 years and 31 participated in the study. After attending the SCD integrative clinic, the majority of patients reported integrative therapies to be an acceptable way of treating pain and believed these to be effective. Overall, the vast majority (88 %) of patients reported having a positive experience with the therapies offered in the clinic. None of the patients experienced any adverse events related to integrative therapies provided in the clinic. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that encouraging conversations and offering safe and potentially effective integrative therapies alongside conventional SCD therapies under medical guidance allows patients to have an open discussion about their beliefs and treatment goals, improves patient satisfaction and can improve outcomes.

We report results of a phase 1 multicenter stem cell transplantation (SCT) trial from HLA-matched (n = 7) or one-antigen-mismatched (n = 7) unrelated donors (URD) using bone marrow or cord blood as stem cell source, following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in severe sickle cell disease (SCD). Conditioning included distal alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan (matched donors), with thiotepa (mismatched donors). Abatacept, a selective inhibitor of T cell costimulation, was added to tacrolimus and methotrexate as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to offset GVHD risks, and was administered for longer duration in bone marrow recipients than in cord blood recipients because of increased incidence of chronic GVHD with bone marrow. Median age at transplant was 13 years (range, 7-21 years). The incidence of grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute GVHD at day +100 was 28.6% and 7%, respectively. One-year incidence of chronic GVHD was 57% and mild/limited in all but 1 patient who received abatacept for a longer duration. Only 1 patient developed reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome and recovered. With a median follow-up of 1.6 years (range, 1-5.5 years), the 2-year overall and disease-free survival was 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The encouraging results from the phase 1 portion of this RIC SCT trial, despite risk factors such as older age, URD, and HLA-mismatch, support further evaluation of URD SCT in clinical trial settings. The phase 2 portion of the trial is in progress. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03128996.

28467346	Chronic anemia and thyroid function.	Anaemia is a global public health problem affecting both developing and developed countries with major consequences for human health as well as social and economic development. It occurs at all stages of the life cycle, but is more prevalent in pregnant women and young children. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) impairs thyroid metabolism in animals and human and may negatively affect growth and develpment of children. On the other hand both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with anemia and adding iron to thyroxine therapy improves both conditions compared to thyroxine therapy alone. In addition patients with chronic hemolytic anemia requiring repeated blood transfusion have high prevalence of hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis. Both primary hypothyroidism and central hypothyroidism occur in these patients with increasing prevalence with age, severity of the anemia and higher ferritin concentration denoting poor chelation.  Proper blood transfusion and intensive chelation appears to prevent deterioration of thyroid function and in many cases can reverse thyroid pathology. Physicians treating these forms of anemia should be aware of thyroid disorders in these patients for early screening, prevention and proper management of any thyroid dysfunction.
31790841	Outcomes in Patients with Moyamoya Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Moyamoya syndrome, a progressive, idiopathic stenosis of the internal carotid arteries, results in increased risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Revascularization procedures have been shown in small studies to be both safe and efficacious for these patients; however, randomized controlled trials are lacking. The goal of this systematic review is to organize the literature evaluating surgical intervention versus conservative medical management. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including studies with 3 or more participants with moyamoya syndrome in the setting of sickle cell disease and a measured outcome after either medical or surgical intervention. Relevant studies were identified using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria and a set of predetermined key words. RESULTS: Sixty-one articles were identified with 6 articles ultimately included in this review (N = 122). Of the patients, 73 (59.8%) were revascularized surgically (all indirect procedures), whereas 49 (40.2%) remained on chronic transfusion therapy. Of the patients that underwent indirect revascularization surgery, a total of 1 perioperative (1.4%) and 4 postoperative strokes (5.5%) were reported over 44 months (1 stroke per 53.3 patient-years). In comparison, an average of 46.5% of patients who were receiving chronic transfusions had major events (stroke or transient ischemic attack) while undergoing therapy (1 stroke per 13.65 patient-years, P = 0.00215). CONCLUSIONS: We present a large systematic review of the literature regarding outcomes of surgical and medical management for patients with moyamoya syndrome and sickle cell disease. The findings redemonstrate the efficacy and safety of surgical revascularization, and advocate for earlier discussion around surgical intervention.
33368343	Safety and benefits of automated red cell depletion-exchange compared to standard exchange in patients with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic transfusion.	BACKGROUND: The Spectra Optia allows automated performance of red blood cell reduction and isovolemic hemodilution (IHD) prior to standard red cell exchange (RCE), and is primarily intended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing chronic RCE. Data on the safety of inducing transient further anemia and the benefits of IHD-RCE is limited and occasionally contradictory. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective crossover analysis of six patients with SCD who underwent chronic exchange with standard RCE (Cobe Spectra) followed by IHD-RCE (Spectra Optia), we compared safety and benefit outcomes with IHD-RCE vs standard RCE. RESULTS: There were statistically but not clinically significant drops in blood pressure in the post-IHD phase. With IHD-RCE, there were significant reductions in red blood cell (RBC) usage and/or lower fraction of cells and significant increases in postprocedure hematocrit (Hct) associated with increased preprocedure Hct. There were no differences achieved in the time interval between procedures or in the net RBC gain with IHD-RCE. Overall, there were also no significant differences in pre- and postprocedure percentage of hemoglobin S, reticulocyte count, interval daily hemoglobin A decrement, or postprocedure white blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports that IHD-RCE can be safely used in patients with stroke risk and compared to standard RCE, results in benefits of lower RBC usage and/or fraction of cells remaining and higher postprocedure Hct associated with higher preprocedure Hct. These findings support wider use of IHD-RCE, especially in the current environment with reduced availability of minority units.
29386039	Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to asymptomatic poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in a child with sickle cell anemia: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a neurotoxic condition that occurs as a result of the failure of posterior circulatory autoregulation in response to acute changes in blood pressure. Overperfusion with resultant disruption of the blood-brain barrier results in vasogenic edema, but not infarction. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome can be the presenting feature of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which has been reported in approximately 5% of hospitalized children, and it has been reported in very few cases of adult patients with sickle cell anemia. We report a very rare case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome that occurred in a child with sickle cell anemia. This presentation should be differentiated from other neurologic manifestations that occur in patients with sickle cell anemia, because management is totally different. CASE PRESENTATION: We report what is to our knowledge the first reported case of a 9-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell anemia who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to asymptomatic poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. This occurred after full recovery from acute chest syndrome and severe vaso-occlusive crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this report is to emphasize that all efforts should be made to explore the causes of different neurologic manifestations that occur in patients with sickle cell anemia, because this will require different pathways of management.

37184905	Developing an Implementation Blueprint for the NIH HEAL Initiative GRACE Trial: Perspectives on Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation for Chronic Sickle Cell Disease Pain.	Objective: This study aimed to explore perspectives of people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) and SCD clinic providers and staff about the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for treating chronic SCD pain. Data obtained were to inform an implementation blueprint for an effectiveness implementation clinical trial (GRACE Trial) testing whether acupuncture or guided relaxation reduces chronic pain when compared with usual care. Design: Qualitative research design. Methods: We conducted 33 semistructured interviews with people with SCD and SCD clinic providers and staff. Interviews were transcribed and coded. A deductive content analysis process was used to identify themes. Results: Four themes were identified: Receptivity to Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation, Limited Awareness, Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) Therapy Preference, and Access Barriers. Both patients and clinic providers and staff were open to the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic pain treatment. After learning about these CIH therapies, some patients expressed a preference for one therapy over the other. They also discussed their ability to successfully engage with each therapy. There is a need to dispel misconceptions about the therapies by increasing understanding of how each therapy is implemented and functions to reduce pain. We identified several potential barriers that might affect the success of the trial and future health system integration, including time, transportation, and technology. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to present perspectives of both patients with SCD and clinic providers and staff on the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic SCD pain. Stakeholders' early input and perspectives highlighted that they welcome nonpharmacological CIH therapies. Implementation of a clinical trial and future health system integration will require the addressing misinformation and identifying strategies to overcome access barriers. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04906447.
31537695	Extensive multilineage analysis in patients with mixed chimerism after allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease: insight into hematopoiesis and engraftment thresholds for gene therapy.	Although studies of mixed chimerism following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may provide insights into the engraftment needed to correct the disease and into immunological reconstitution, an extensive multilineage analysis is lacking. We analyzed chimerism simultaneously in peripheral erythroid and granulomonocytic precursors/progenitors, highly purified B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and red blood cells (RBC). Thirty-four patients with mixed chimerism and >=12 months of follow-up were included. A selective advantage of donor RBC and their progenitors/precursors led to full chimerism in mature RBC (despite partial engraftment of other lineages), and resulted in the clinical control of the disease. Six patients with donor chimerism <50% had hemolysis (reticulocytosis) and higher HbS than their donor. Four of them had donor chimerism <30%, including a patient with AA donor (hemoglobin >10 g/dL) and three with AS donors (hemoglobin <10 g/dL). However, only one vaso-occlusive crisis occurred with 68.7% HbS. Except in the patients with the lowest chimerism, the donor engraftment was lower for T cells than for the other lineages. In a context of mixed chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for SCD, myeloid (rather than T cell) engraftment was the key efficacy criterion. Results show that myeloid chimerism as low as 30% was sufficient to prevent a vaso-occlusive crisis in transplants from an AA donor but not constantly from an AS donor. However, the correction of hemolysis requires higher donor chimerism levels (i.e >=50%) in both AA and AS recipients. In the future, this group of patients may need a different therapeutic approach.
38066873	Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.	Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.
35260809	A population-based analysis of predictors of penile surgical intervention among inpatients with acute priapism.	While consensus exists regarding risk factors for priapism, predictors of operative intervention are less well established. We assessed patient and hospital-level predictors associated with penile surgical intervention (PSI) for patients admitted with acute priapism, as well as length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charges using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015). Inpatients with acute priapism were stratified by PSI, defined as penile shunts, incisions, and placement of penile prostheses, exclusive of irrigation procedures. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were utilized to assess predictors of PSI. Negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare PSI to LOS and total hospital charges, respectively. Among 14,529 weighted hospitalizations, 4,953 underwent PSI. Non-Medicare insurances, substance abuse, and >=3 Elixhauser comorbidities had increased odds of PSI. Conversely, Black patients, sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, neurologic diseases, malignancies, and teaching hospitals had lower odds. PSI coincided with shorter median LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.62; p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the mean hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Additional subgroup analysis revealed penile incisions and shunts primarily associated with reduced LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.66; p < 0.001) and total hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Further work is required to understand predictors of poor outcomes in these populations.

29659464	Transitioning Patients With Iron Overload From Exjade to Jadenu.	Iron overload is a concern for patients who require chronic transfusions as a result of inherited or acquired anemias, including sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) is the primary treatment for iron overload in these patients. The ICT deferasirox, which has been available as an oral dispersible tablet for liquid suspension, is now also available as a once-daily, film-coated tablet (FCT). Deferasirox FCT allows greater convenience and may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects versus the original formulation. Dose adjustment increments, determined by titration monitoring, are lower for the FCT because of greater bioavailability.
32869281	Changing the Clinical Paradigm of Hydroxyurea Treatment for Sickle Cell Anemia Through Precision Medicine.	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common and devastating inherited blood disorder, affecting millions of people across the world. Without treatment, SCA results in tremendous morbidity and early mortality. Hydroxyurea is the primary and most well-established pharmacologic therapy with proven benefits to ameliorate the clinical course of SCA, primarily due to its ability to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which prevents sickling of red blood cells. The optimal induction of HbF depends upon selection and maintenance of the proper dose that maximizes benefits and minimizes toxicity. Due to the significant interpatient variability in hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing, most patients treated with hydroxyurea receive suboptimal doses and have only modest treatment responses. Recognizing this variability, using a precision medicine approach, we developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized dosing model for children with SCA, designed to optimize the hydroxyurea dose and clinical response. We utilize novel laboratory methods and a sparse sampling strategy requiring only 10 muL of blood collected 15 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes after a test dose. We use Bayesian adaptive control to estimate hydroxyurea exposure and to select an individual, optimal starting dose. This dosing model has resulted in HbF responses >30-40%, levels beyond what is achieved with traditional weight-based dosing and trial and error dose escalation. This hydroxyurea dosing strategy, if widely implemented, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm of hydroxyurea therapy and improve outcomes for the millions of patients with SCA across the world.
29266772	Efficacy and Tolerance of Lidocaine 5% Patches in Neuropathic Pain and Pain Related to Vaso-occlusive Sickle Cell Crises in Children: A Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.	BACKGROUND: The management of neuropathic pain and pain related to bone vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease remains challenging in children. Lidocaine 5% patches are recommended in adults for neuropathic pain treatment, but they are not recommended in children. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerance of lidocaine 5% patches in pediatric inpatients. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II study aimed to assess the use of lidocaine 5% patches in 6- to 21-year-old pediatric patients suffering from neuropathic pain or superficial bone vaso-occlusive crises. Patches were applied on the painful area for 12 hours a day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of inpatients with significant pain relief defined as a decrease of at least 2 points on the visual analog pain scale (VAS) measured at 12 hours after patch placement over at least 2 consecutive days. RESULTS: The 12-hour VAS score decreased by at least 2 points over 2 consecutive days in 48.6% of patients 95% unilateral confidence interval (33.8%). Only 7.7% of patients experienced grade 1 or grade 2 toxicities. CONCLUSION: Although lidocaine 5% patches decreased the pain's intensity in nearly half of the enrolled patients with an excellent tolerance, the efficacy endpoint was not reached. Further studies should consider a more refined selection of the experimental population to assess the efficacy of lidocaine 5% patches in the pediatric population.
37858508	The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income countries.

27982320	Allogenic bone narrow transplantation in sickle-cell diseases.	Sickle-cell diseases are the most common inherited hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Improvement in survival has been seen in the last decades with the introduction of careful screening and prevention of complications and the introduction of hydroxyurea. Stem-cell transplantation is currently the only curative option for these patients and has been indicated for patients with neurological events, repeated vaso-occlusive crisis, any organ damage or presence of red blood cell antibodies. Related bone-marrow or cord-blood transplant has shown an overall survival of more than 90% with a disease-free survival of 90% in 1,000 patients transplanted in the last decades. The use of unrelated donors unfortunately has not shown the same good results, but better typing methods and improved support may improve the outcome with this source of stem cells in the future. In Brazil, only recently stem cell transplant from related donors has been included in the procedures performed in the public health system. The use of related bone marrow or cord blood and a myeloablative conditioning regimen are considered standard of care for patients with sickle-cell diseases. Transplants with non-myeloablative regimens, unrelated donors or haploidentical donors should be performed only in controlled clinical trials.
34252204	Impact of universal irradiation on chronic transfusion for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Irradiation of blood products prevents transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, but most patients do not require this modification which could have an adverse impact on transfusion outcomes. We hypothesized that irradiation may increase transfusion requirements for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving chronic transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our pediatric hospital implemented a new policy of universal blood product irradiation in May 2018. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD receiving chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion throughout the year before and after institution of this policy. The primary outcome was the change in RBC transfusion volume per patient weight transfused during the pre- vs. post- universal irradiation period. Secondary outcomes were the change in median pretransfusion laboratory values. RESULTS: Among 17 patients, 8 (47%) received more RBCs the year before irradiation and 9 (53%) received more the year after irradiation. Implementation of universal irradiation did not significantly increase transfusion volumes needed to clinically manage this population (median change +1.7 ml/kg/year, p = .54). Additionally, there were no significant changes in absolute reticulocyte count, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, serum potassium, and ferritin during the two time periods. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with SCD receiving simple chronic transfusion, irradiation did not impact transfusion requirements or pertinent pretransfusion laboratory values. Irradiation does not appear to have clinically significant consequences for SCD chronic transfusion management.
31697818	How I treat sickle cell disease with hematopoietic cell transplantation.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to significant morbidity and early mortality, and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only widely available cure, with impacts seen on SCD-related organ dysfunction. Outcomes are excellent following matched-related donor (MRD) HCT, leading to significantly expanded application of this treatment over the past decade. The majority of SCD patients lack an MRD, but outcomes following alternative donor HCT continue to improve on clinical trials. Within this framework, we aim to provide our perspective on how to apply research findings to clinical practice, for an individual patient. We also emphasize that the preparation of SCD recipients for HCT and supporting them through HCT have special nuances that require awareness and close attention. Through the use of clinical vignettes, we provide our perpsective on the complex decision-making process in HCT for SCD as well as recommendations for the evaluation and support of these patients through HCT.
32949739	Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Patient with Sickle Cell Anemia Using Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis.	The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) management is lacking, particularly in specific patient subgroups. The current case report demonstrates the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) therapy in conjunction with standard systemic anticoagulation in a patient with sickle cell disease presenting with a submassive PE and chronic thrombus burden. CDT may potentially play a role in the management of submassive PE in sickle cell patients.
28895851	Gene Therapy Approaches to Hemoglobinopathies.	Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is currently based on transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with a lentiviral vector expressing a globin gene under the control of globin transcriptional regulatory elements. Preclinical and early clinical studies showed the safety and potential efficacy of this therapeutic approach as well as the hurdles still limiting its general application. In addition, for both beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, an altered bone marrow microenvironment reduces the efficiency of stem cell harvesting as well as engraftment. These hurdles need be addressed for gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies to become a clinical reality.
29540903	L-Glutamine approved for use in patients with sickle cell disease.	
33461919	Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies.	Beta hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia (BT) are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide. Both diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Because patients require lifelong follow-up and care, it also poses a serious burden in health services. Blood transfusions and/or drug therapy ameliorate the signs and symptoms of the disorders but are not curative. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is currently the only cure but it has several limitations including the paucity of human leukocyte antigen-matched related donors and a high risk of adverse events. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell based-gene therapy has made autologous HCT (auto-HCT) a reality. Clinical trials are underway using different gene transfer vectors and cassettes. Data obtained so far with a short-term follow-up has been very encouraging. Patients with SCD engrafted, had sustained production of the transgene and a decreased number of vaso-occlusive crises. Patients with BT were able to decrease the amount of transfusions required or stop transfusions all together. Adverse events observed were mostly associated with the myeloablative conditioning regimen. Long term data on gene persistence and toxicities are still needed. This review focuses on the current state of auto-HCT with gene therapy for SCD and BT. Current clinical trials and their outcome results are summarized.
28408108	Therapeutic drug monitoring-guided dosing of busulfan differs from weight-based dosing in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.	Busulfan (Bu)-based preparative regimens in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are commonly used. Previous studies have shown that Bu at a fixed dose of 3.2mg/kg/day (FBD) given intravenously decreases variability in drug pharmacokinetics and this decreases the dependency on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Bu. We compared the Bu dose given using TDM with the FBD of 3.2mg/kg/day. Seventy-three patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia, thalassemia major, and sickle cell disease were included. The mean age at transplant was 15years (range 2-55years) with 57% adults. Indication for transplantation was leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in 46% of the patients, while the remaining 54% were transplanted for inherited blood disorders. We found that the median FBD was lower than the median TDM dose by 39mg/day with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) even after adjusting for the weight (median total FBD of 349mg, median TDM dose of 494mg, p<0.0001). Age and underlying condition (malignant vs. nonmalignant) were the main factors affecting Bu clearance (p<0.001 and p<0.07, respectively). TDM remains an important tool for the appropriate dosing of Bu in preparative regimens of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially in populations with genetic admixture.
32202245	Standard management of sickle cell disease complications.	Sickle cell disease remains a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the United States. The survival rate of children and adolescents has increased immensely in developed countries, whereas the survival rate for adults lagged behind. The increase in the pediatric survival rate is attributable to the institution of hydroxyurea treatment as well as stroke prevention strategies. In this review, we discuss the management of the sickle disease major complications such as pain, stroke, and acute chest syndrome with the most current hydroxyurea use and transfusion therapy.
37595686	Treosulfan-based conditioning regimen in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A retrospective analysis on behalf of the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (GETH-TC).	INTRODUCTION: Data on treosulfan-based conditioning regimens are little by little increasing, and the benefits of this approach are consistent, particularly regarding acute toxicity. This study aims to describe the results of treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in children, focusing on toxicity and outcomes when used to treat both malignant and non-malignant diseases. METHODS: Retrospective observational study on pediatric patients treated in Spain with treosulfan-based conditioning regimens before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), based on data collection from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty treosulfan-based conditioning HSCTs to treat non-malignant diseases (n=117) or malignant diseases (n=43) in 158 children and adolescents are reported. Median age at HSCT was 5.1 years (IQR: 2-10). The most frequent diagnoses were primary immunodeficiency (n=42; 36%) and sickle cell disease (n=42; 36%) in the non-malignant cohort and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=15; 35%) in the malignant cohort. Engraftment occurred in 97% of the patients. There was a longer median time to neutrophil engraftment (17 vs. 14 days; p=0.008) and platelet engraftment (20 vs. 15 days; p=0.002) in the non-malignant cohort. The 1-year cumulative incidence of VOD was 7.98 (95%CI [4.6-13.6]), with no significant differences between cohorts. The 1-year cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGvHD was higher in the malignant cohort (18% vs. 3.2%; p=0.011). Overall, cGvHD was more frequently observed in the malignant cohort for both total incidence (9 vs. 3%; p<0.001) and 2-year cumulative incidence of total cGvHD (16 vs. 1.9%; p<0.001). The 2-year cumulative TRM was 15%, with no differences between cohorts. 5-year Overall Survival was 80% (95%CI [72-86]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (87 vs. 61%; p=0.01). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the malignant cohort was 25%. 5-year cumulative GRFS rate was 60% (95%CI [51-70]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (72 vs. 22%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The treosulfan-based radiation-free conditioning regimen is feasible, achieving a high engraftment rate and 5-year overall survival. A treosulfan-based conditioning regimen is an emerging option for the first HSCT in non-malignant diseases.
35617049	Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait patients.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle trait (Hb SA) or sickle disease (Hb SS) carries increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Hb SS patients are young and lack common comorbid conditions that qualify them for VTE prophylaxis (VTEP). METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter analysis of Hb SS/Hb SA adult patients between January 2013 and December 2018. RESULTS: There were 803 Hb SA (525 patients) and 1020 Hb SS admissions (262 patients). VTEP use was similar between Hb SA and controls (42% vs. 46%; p-value = .06) and Hb SS and controls (45% vs. 42%; p-value = .13). Hb SS/Hb SA patients more frequently received more than half of prescribed doses of VTEP. In multivariate analysis, increasing age and longer hospitalizations were positive predictors. Odds of VTEP use varied with treatment site for Hb SS patients, whereas comorbid conditions, admission hemoglobin and platelet count were not predictive. By contrast, in Hb SA patients, comorbid conditions, higher admission hemoglobin, and higher admission platelet counts raised the odds of VTEP being offered. CONCLUSIONS: VTEP is underused in Hb SS/Hb SA patients. There may be a trend toward offering more VTEP in Hb SS disease, but not in Hb SA patients, where VTEP prescribing is driven by comorbid conditions rather than genotype. Patient compliance does not appear to play a major role, but intercenter variability suggests provider education may improve VTEP use.
30988105	Isolated intermittent neurogenic priapism: an unusual presentation in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.	Priapism is a relatively uncommon clinical presentation. The well-recognised causes are sickle cell anaemia and the use of medications, such as vasoactive erectile agents. Infrequently, it could be the result of lumbar spinal stenosis. The authors reported an elderly man with 1-year history of isolated intermittent priapism aggravated by walking. MRI showed lumbosacral spondylosis with severe stenosis at the level of L4-L5. Total laminectomy of L4 and L5 was done, resulting in a rapid and complete resolution of symptom without recurrence during the follow-up time of 10 years.
30879337	Purulent Pericarditis in Sickle Cell Disease Due to Streptococcus agalactiae; a Unique Case Report and Literature Review.	Purulent pericarditis is a localized infection with a thick, fibrinous hypercellular exudate and is historically associated with a high mortality. We describe a case of purulent pericarditis due to Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) in a 30-year-old woman with sickle cell disease who presented with fever, dyspnea, and S. agalactiae septicemia. Despite timely initiation of antibiotics, she developed a large purulent pericardial effusion requiring surgical pericardiocentesis followed by a pericardial window. At 14 months follow-up, she has remained asymptomatic without sequelae. A review of the literature contained only four patients with purulent pericarditis in sickle cell patients. We discuss the unique aspects of this case in the context of purulent pericarditis in the age of modern antibiotics and hypothesize on the pathogenesis of delayed pericardial effusion after pericarditis.
32039737	Impact of a paediatric-adult care transition programme on the health status of patients with sickle cell disease: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (the DREPADO trial).	BACKGROUND: Thanks to advancements in medical care, a majority of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) worldwide live beyond 18 years of age, and therefore, patients initially followed in paediatric departments are then transferred to adult departments. This paediatric-adult care transition is a period with an increased risk of discontinuity of care and subsequent morbidity and mortality. During this period, the patient will have to manage new interlocutors and places of care, and personal issues related to the period of adolescence. To take into consideration all these aspects, an interesting approach is to use the whole system approach to the patient, as presented in the biopsychosocial approach. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the impact of the proposed biopsychosocial paediatric-adult transition programme. METHODS: The DREPADO study is a multicentre randomised control trial comparing a control group (Arm A) to an interventional group with a paediatric-adult transition programme based on a biopsychosocial approach (Arm B). To be included, patients should have the SS, SC, or Sbeta form of sickle cell disease and be aged between 16 and 17 years. The randomisation in a 1:1 ratio assigns to Arm A or B. The primary outcome is the number of hospital admissions and emergencies for complications in the index hospital, in the 2 years after the first consultation in the adult department of care. Secondary outcomes consider the quality of life, but also include coping skills such as sense of self-efficacy and disease knowledge. To provide patient and parent knowledge and coping skills, the transition programme is composed of three axes: educational, psychological, and social, conducted individually and in groups. DISCUSSION: By providing self-care knowledge and coping skills related to SCD and therapeutics, helping empower patientsin relation to pain management and emotions, and facilitating the relationship to oneself, others, and care in Arm B of the DREPADO study, we believe that the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD may be reduced after the proposed paediatric-adult transition programme.

37498339	The use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH): a retrospective study.	PURPOSE: As most of the cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) in Saudi Arabia is seen in young population and as literature showed good effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain and oedema in avascular necrosis and delaying the need of surgical intervention. Our purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain, improving range of motion (ROM) and delaying the surgical intervention in patient with AVN of femoral head and compare our results to published literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have treated 24 patients, 13 males and 11 females with a mean age of 29 years (range 14-48) with 34 hips affected. There were 14 unilateral and ten bilateral lesions. In our series 11 out of 24 patients (45.8%) were due to sickle cell disease. Other causes included idiopathic in five patients (20.8%), corticosteroids use and systemic lupus erythematous in three patients each (12.5% each) and post-traumatic AVN in two patients (8.3%). Extracorporeal shock wave therapy was implanted in FICAT stage I, II and III. All patients had two sessions of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, four to six weeks apart, each with 4000 impulses divided into four points. Radiological and MRI assessment were performed at regular time intervals with a minimum follow-up of two years. Clinical assessment was based on Visual Analog Scale and Harris Hip Score (HHS). The end point outcome measurement was the need for any operative intervention. RESULTS: Operative intervention was necessary in eight out of 34 hips (23.5%), within an average of 2.5 years (range 1 to 5 years). A hip salvage was achieved in 76.5%. Function was improved with the Harris Hip Score from a mean of 54.6 to 80.4 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). Pain assessed with Visual Analog Scale improved from 5.73 to 2.75 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). CONCLUSION: We do recommend the use of ESWT in treating AVN of bone whether of femoral head or other sites prior to the collapse of the articular surface. Further studies are needed to compare using two or more sessions as well as using four or six points for ESWT.
31520310	Sickle Cell Intrahepatic Cholestasis with Acute Liver Failure and Acute Kidney Injury: Favourable Outcome with Exchange Transfusion.	
29078924	Sickle Cell Disease in the Emergency Department.	Acute painful episodes are the most common reason for emergency department visits among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Early and aggressive pain management is a priority. Emergency providers (EPs) must also diagnose other emergent diagnoses in patients with SCD and differentiate them from vaso-occlusive crisis. EPs should be aware of cognitive biases that may misdirect the diagnostic process. Administration of intravenous fluids should be used judiciously. Blood transfusion may be considered. Coordination of care with hematology is an important part of the effective emergency department and long-term management of patients with SCD.
35181561	Reduction in the Prevalence of Thrombotic Events in Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation.	Thrombosis is a recognized complication in sickle cell disease (SCD). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains the sole curative option for patients with severe SCD phenotypes. Data describing the effects of allo-HCT on recurrent thrombotic events (venous and arterial events) are limited, however. We evaluated 31 patients with SCD who underwent allo-HCT with a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range, 13 to 115) post-transplantation. No patient continued anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after allo-HCT. There was an absolute difference of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3% to 32.2%; P = .002) in the prevalence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events before and after allo-HSCT. In addition, there was an absolute difference of 38.5% (95% CI, 10.63 to 45.96; P = .006) in the number of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) occurring before and after allo-HSCT. Patients with severe SCD who undergo allo-HCT are less likely to develop recurrent thrombotic events compared with a control cohort of patients matched for age and genotype (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.058 to 0.83; P = .025). Following curative therapy with allo-HCT, there is a reduction in recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with severe SCD phenotypes.
37318395	A systematic review of clinical trials for gene therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathy around the world.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Amidst the success of cell therapy for the treatment of onco-hematological diseases, the first recently Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy product for patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) indicates the feasibility of gene therapy as curative for genetic hematologic disorders. This work analyzed the current-world scenario of clinical trials involving gene therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: Eighteen trials for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 24 for patients with TDT were analyzed. RESULTS: Most are phase 1 and 2 trials, funded by the industry and are currently recruiting volunteers. Treatment strategies for both diseases are fetal hemoglobin induction (52.4%); addition of wild-type or therapeutic beta-globin gene (38.1%) and correction of mutations (9,5%). Gene editing (52.4%) and gene addition (40.5%) are the two most used techniques. The United States and France are the countries with the greatest number of clinical trials centers for SCD, with 83.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The United States (41.1%), China (26%) and Italy (6.8%) lead TDT trials centers. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trial concentration indicates the high costs of this technology, logistical issues and social challenges that need to be overcome for gene therapy to reach low- and middle-income countries where SCD and TDT are prevalent and where they most impact the patient's health.
33852506	Peripartum considerations in sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnancy exacerbates sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased frequency and severity of complications resulting in high levels of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. We review recent recommendations for managing SCD in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: An updated pathobiological model of SCD now attributes the clinical picture to a vicious cycle of four major cellular disturbances. Management decisions should be guided by an understanding of this upgraded model. Red cell transfusions are a key therapeutic intervention used in managing several acute and chronic complications. Transfusion however has significant drawbacks. The American Society of Hematology recently published transfusion guidelines to support care providers. SUMMARY: Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary and experienced team. The perioperative episode is a recognized period of disease exacerbation and informed anesthetic management can contribute to improved patient outcomes.
35082243	Identifying and Treating Severe Bone Marrow Necrosis and Fat Embolism Syndrome in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Fat embolism syndrome after bone marrow necrosis is an extremely rare complication in sickle cell disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. This case report will assist pediatric clinicians and hematologists to recognize this severe complication in patients with sickle cell disease and to promptly initiate treatment. Red flags include severe bone pain, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, decreasing platelet count, peripheral leukocyte left shift, elevated nucleated red blood cells, and significant elevation in plasma ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. We report a pediatric patient who was diagnosed early, received urgent red cell exchange transfusion and plasma exchange, and ultimately survived this devastating complication.

29958565	When there is no match, the game is not over: Alternative donor options for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease.	Many patients with sickle cell disease experience severe morbidity and early mortality. The only curative option remains hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although HLA-matched sibling transplantation has been very successful for adults and children, the vast majority of patients with sickle cell disease do not have an HLA-matched sibling. Alternative donor options include haploidentical, unrelated umbilical cord blood, and matched unrelated donor transplantation. This report summarizes major alternative donor transplantation studies reported to date and ongoing and upcoming clinical trials. We conclude that when there is no HLA-match, all these approaches should be systematically considered before ruling out the option of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
28994899	Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) are particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD in relation to:1. incidence of infection;2. mortality;3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community;4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform. Additionally, we carried out handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 19 December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials (880 children randomised) met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with SCD (SS or Sbeta0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-quality evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-quality evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five.Overall, the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.
36705266	Immunological efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination including the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in adult patients with sickle-cell disease: results of the randomized DREVAC controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal diseases. The immunological efficacy of 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is poorly documented in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a randomized open-labelled phase 2 study of the immunogenicity of PCV13 at week (W)0, followed by PPSV23 at W4, compared to PPSV23 alone at W4 in adult patients with SCD. The proportion of responders (four-fold increase of serotype-specific IgG antibodies) to at least 10-shared serotypes was assessed at W8. Secondary endpoints were: i) geometrical mean titers (GMTs), ii) responders to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes, iii) pneumococcal opsonophagocytic (OPA) activity, and iv) response durability at W24 and W96. RESULTS: In total, 128 patients were randomized in the PCV13/PPSV23 (n=63) or PPSV23-alone groups (n=65). At W8, 24.56% and 8.20% of patients from the PCV13/PPSV23 and PPSV23 groups, respectively, reached the primary endpoint (p=0.016). These numbers were 36.2% and 8.7% for OPA responders (p=0.002). A combined PCV13/PPSV23 strategy improved the breadth of responses to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes with 15.8%, 35%, 24.6%, and 24.6% versus 52.5%, 31%, 8%, and 8% in the PPSV23 group. At W96, GMTs were significantly higher in the PCV13/PPSV23 than in the PPSV23 alone group for five serotypes (4, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F). CONCLUSIONS: A PCV13/PPSV23 regimen improved the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses against a large range of pneumococcal serotypes in adults with SCD. The sustainability of the immune response requires recall strategies.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02274415.
35180761	Introduction of Hydroxyurea Therapy to a Cohort of Sickle Cell Patients in Northern Haiti.	Although the prevalence of sickle cell anemia is high in Haiti, treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) is uncommon. HU therapy was started at a hospital in Northern Haiti for children and young adults who had presented with complications of their disease. The patients were followed in clinic for their response to therapy and the principal outcome was hospitalization for complications. There was a 70% decrease in the rate of hospitalization in the cohort with no significant complications or deaths during the study period. Treatment with HU is a proven therapy that reduces the morbidity associated with sickle cell anemia and efforts should be made to assure access and affordability in regions with a high prevalence.

33193339	Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation a Review and a Pilot Study in Children Treated With Decidua Stromal Cells for Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease.	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are rare precursors in all organs of the body. MSCs have profound anti-inflammatory effects and reduce alloreactivity in vitro and in vivo. In pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), MSCs have mainly been used to treat acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). MSCs are commercially available for this indication in Canada, Japan, and New Zeeland. More rare indications for MSCs in pediatric patients include graft failure and chronic GVHD. MSCs from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, Wharton's jelly, placenta tissue, and decidua have been used, but the optimal clinical stromal cell source has not been compared in clinical trials. More experimental clinical indications using MSCs, such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhages, pneumo-mediastinum, and neuroinflammation have primarily been explored in animal models or adult HCT patients. MSCs have almost no if any side-effects. In this pilot study we report the outcome of six children treated with decidua stromal cells (DSCs) for steroid refractory acute GVHD. At 6 months, complete response was seen in four patients and partial response in two patients. One child with high-risk ALL died from relapse and a boy with sickle cell disease died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Five-year survival was 67% and all survivors showed a Lansky score of 100%. To conclude, MSCs from various organs are well-tolerated and have shown an encouraging outcome for acute GVHD in pediatric patients.
35810055	[Acute chest syndrome in adult sickle cell patients].	Sickle cell disease is a frequent genetic condition, due to a mutation of the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of an abnormal S hemoglobin and characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive events. The acute chest syndrome is a severe complication associated with a significant disability and mortality. It is defined by the association of one or more clinical respiratory manifestations and a new infiltrate on lung imaging. Its pathophysiology is complex and implies vaso-occlusive phenomena (pulmonary vascular thrombosis, fat embolism), infection, and alveolar hypoventilation. S/S or S/beta0-thalassemia genotype, a history of vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome, a low F hemoglobin level (<5%), a high steady-state hemoglobin level (> 10 g/dL), or a high steady-state leukocytosis (>10 G/L) are the main risk factors. Febrile chest pain, dyspnea, sometimes cough with expectorations are its main clinical manifestations, and bi-basal crackles are found at auscultation. Inferior alveolar opacities with or without pleural effusions are identified on chest X-ray or CT-scan. Management of the acute chest syndrome should be prompt and implies, besides the recognition of severity signs, a multimodal analgesia, oxygen supplementation, sometimes a parenteral antibiotic treatment and the frequent use of blood transfusions especially in the most severe cases. Prevention is important and includes a regular monitoring of hospitalized patients and the use of incentive spirometry.
35659126	Liver Transplantation After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Sickle cell anemia is the most common of the hemoglobinopathies, in which the abnormal hemoglobin formed in deoxygenation states undergoes a polymerization process with consequent erythrocyte deformation and vaso-occlusive events. The need for multiple blood transfusions, prolonged ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and increased iron absorption can cause iron overload in the liver, leading to liver fibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only treatment with a curative potential for this disease and can establish normal complete or partial donor-derived erythropoiesis and stabilize or restore function in affected organs, preventing further deterioration of function. However, it does not reverse preexisting liver fibrosis and siderosis. One of the possible complications of patients who undergo HSCT is chronic liver disease, which has a multifactorial cause, with iron overload being an important factor. In the long term, the prevalence of chronic liver disease in HSCT patients, including cirrhosis and its complications, can be significant. Solid organ transplantation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for end-organ failure remains a very rare event. It may offer a valuable treatment strategy in selected recipients, although it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a patient with sickle cell anemia who underwent HSCT and developed severe liver dysfunction requiring liver transplantation 13 years after the procedure. We found no previous report in the literature of orthotopic liver transplant after HCT for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
38582651	Utility of hemoglobin electrophoresis to distinguish between severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction versus hyperhemolysis syndrome.	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) and hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) are both complications of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.Clinically, both present with hemolysis and can be difficult to differentiate. Hemoglobin electrophoresis may aid in the diagnosis. Herein we describe a case in which a patient with hemoglobin SC disease presented with features of severe hemolysis several days after initiation of red blood cell exchange. Increase in reticulocyte count and complete absence of hemoglobin A on electrophoresis during this event supported the diagnosis of severe DHTR, indicating a rapid and selective destruction of the transfused red blood cells. Ability to interpret the hemoglobin electrophoresis can help clinicians distinguish between these two severe transfusion complications in patients living with sickle cell disease. It is important to identify the presence or absence of concomitant HHS, as patients with HHS tend to have a worse prognosis and there is a higher rate of recurrence of HHS with subsequent transfusions. Accurate diagnosis can lead to prompt management and decrease morbidity and mortality.
32583456	Red cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease: an international survey of current practices.	INTRODUCTION: Red cell exchange (RCE) therapy is increasingly used to treat patients with acute or chronic manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, little is known regarding the most safe and effective practice parameters associated with this particular therapy. METHODS: A SCD subcommittee of members of the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) developed a 122-question survey and administered it via email to other ASFA members. The survey inquired about clinical indications for treatment, practice patterns, and transfusion policies for RCE when used for patients with SCD. RESULTS: Ninety-nine distinct institutions completed the survey. Twenty-one (21%) were from outside of the US. Twenty-two (22%) provided chronic transfusion therapy to >10 patients, and both adult (25%) and pediatric-focused services (20%) were represented. Common acute indications for RCE included acute chest syndrome, acute ischemic stroke, and pre-surgical prophylaxis. Common chronic indications included primary stroke prophylaxis, secondary stroke prophylaxis, and recurrent acute chest syndrome. Respondents most commonly set a post-RCE treatment target of 30% for the hematocrit and hemoglobin S levels, regardless of the therapeutic indication. Units for RCE were phenotypically matched in 95% of cases. About 40% of respondents reported using isovolemic hemodilution. CONCLUSIONS: This survey solicited the current practice variations in RCE from a diverse range of practice sites. Many sites reported similar practice patterns and challenges but some variations emerged. To our knowledge, this survey represents the largest and most in-depth investigation of the use of RCE for patients with SCD, and could inform future studies in the field.
35927947	Pulmonary function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD). The use of standard myeloablative conditioning regimens may increase the risk of lung injury. We report serial pulmonary function testing (PFT) outcomes in children with SCD who underwent a matched-sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using nonmyeloablative (NMA) protocol. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review describing pulmonary outcomes in pediatric patients post HCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and a single fraction of 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI), and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Serial PFT testing was performed pre and post HCT. The evaluated pulmonary measures included: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ), FEV1 /FVC, and forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75 ). RESULTS: Twelve subjects were included in the analysis. All had HbSS genotype, and five of the 12 patients had one or more episodes of acute chest syndrome prior to HCT. Serial PFT measures were completed per patient. No patient was diagnosed with chronic GVHD of any organ post HCT. The baseline median FVC, FEV1 , FEV1 /FVC, and FEF25-75 were within the normal range and remained relatively unchanged post HCT. A linear mixed effects model, adjusting for gender and time from HCT, suggested no significant relationship between HCT and PFT parameters, including FVC, FEV1 , and FEV1 /FVC. Interestingly, the FEF25-75 results exhibited a shift in the means post HCT (pre-HCT 86.2% predicted and post-HCT 93.05% predicted, p-value = .018). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that HCT in children with SCD may prevent the anticipated decline in pulmonary function over time.

34263922	Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors.	Intravenous fluid therapy (IV-FT) is routinely used in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), as dehydration possibly promotes and sustains erythrocyte sickling. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of developing diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload due to IV-FT. However, data on the adverse effects of IV-FT for VOC is sparse. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of fluid overload due to IV-FT in patients with SCD. Consecutive hospitalisations for VOC treated with IV-FT between September 2016 and September 2018 were retrospectively analysed. The median (interquartile range) age was 25 0 (18 3-33 8) years and 65% had a severe genotype (HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thal). Fluid overload occurred in 21% of 100 patients. Hospital stay was longer in patients with fluid overload (6 0 vs. 4 0 days, P = 0 037). A positive history of fluid overload (P = 0 017), lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0 011), and top-up transfusion during admission (P = 0 005) were independently associated with fluid overload occurrence. IV-FT was not reduced in 86% of patients despite a previous history of fluid overload. Fluid overload is frequently encountered during IV-FT for VOC. IV-FT is often not adjusted despite a positive history of fluid overload or when top-up transfusion is indicated, emphasising the need for more awareness of this complication and a personalised approach.
32286203	Leg Ulcers in Sickle-Cell Disease: Treatment Update.	Significance: Sickle-cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a severe, chronic, and recurrent complication of sickle-cell disease (SCD). There are no official recommendations for treatment. Recent Advances: Only a few studies with a high level of evidence have been conducted to evaluate treatment of SCLUs. However, several studies have been conducted with a high level of evidence to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in venous leg ulcers, and SCLUs could benefit from these treatments, especially when a venous incompetence or an edema is associated. Pathophysiology of SCLUs includes a vasculopathy related to chronic hemolysis and an endothelial dysfunction, which could be therapeutic approaches to SCLU treatment. Critical Issues: Therapeutic approaches to SCLUs can target SCD on the one hand and skin healing and associated aggravating factors on the other. A review of the literature found only case series and six randomized controlled trials; some offered encouraging results, but most had serious biases. Clinical trials specifically targeting SCLUs are difficult to realize because of the small number of affected patients, in comparison with patients with leg ulcers from other causes. Future Direction: Treating SCLUs remains a challenge. Data in the literature are currently insufficient to offer clear treatment guidelines because of several biases in controlled studies. New studies are under way to assess the efficacy of topical treatments and describe the microbiome of SCLUs. Prevention of SCLU recurrence should be assessed in future clinical trials because the high risk of recurrence is an unsolved critical issue.

28377044	Gene Therapy for beta-Hemoglobinopathies.	beta-Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the world's two most widely disseminated hereditary hemoglobinopathies. beta-Thalassemia originated in the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Asian regions, and SCD originated in central Africa. However, subsequent population migration means that these two diseases are now global and thus constitute a growing health problem in many countries. Despite remarkable improvements in medical care for patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies, there is still only one definitive treatment option: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The development of gene therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies has been justified by (1) the limited availability of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donors, (2) the narrow window of application of HSC transplantation to the youngest patients, and (3) recent advances in HSC-based gene therapy. The huge ongoing efforts in translational medicine and the high number of related publications show that gene therapy has the potential to become the treatment of choice for patients who lack either an HLA genoidentical sibling or an alternative, medically acceptable donor. In this dynamic scientific context, we first summarize the main steps toward clinical translation of this therapeutic approach and then discuss novel lentiviral- and genome editing-based treatment strategies for beta-hemoglobinopathies.
28409830	Magnesium for treating sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive inherited haemoglobinopathy which causes painful vaso-occlusive crises due to sickle red blood cell dehydration. Vaso-occlusive crises are common painful events responsible for a variety of clinical complications; overall mortality is increased and life expectancy decreased compared to the general population. Experimental studies suggest that intravenous magnesium has proven to be well-tolerated in individuals hospitalised for the immediate relief of acute (sudden onset) painful crisis and has the potential to decrease the length of hospital stay. Some in vitro studies and open studies of long-term oral magnesium showed promising effect on pain relief but failed to show its efficacy. The studies show that oral magnesium therapy may prevent sickle red blood cell dehydration and prevent recurrent painful episodes. There is a need to access evidence for the impact of oral and intravenous magnesium effect on frequency of pain, length of hospital stay and quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of short-term intravenous magnesium on the length of hospital stay and quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. To determine the effects of long-term oral magnesium therapy on the frequency of painful crises and the quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books.Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 01 December 2016.Date of last search of other resources (clinical trials registries): 29 March 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled studies of oral or intravenous magnesium compared to placebo or no magnesium. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed the study quality and extracted the data using standard Cochrane methodologies. MAIN RESULTS: We included five randomized placebo-controlled studies with a total of 386 participants (aged three to 53 years). Two shorter parallel studies (n = 306) compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo (normal saline) for admission to hospital due to a vaso-occlusive crisis, for which we were able to analyse data. The quality of evidence was moderate for studies presenting this comparison mainly due to limitations due to risk of bias and imprecision. Two of the three longer-term studies comparing oral magnesium pidolate to placebo had a cross-over design. The third was a parallel factorial study which compared hydroxyurea and oral magnesium to each other and to placebo over a longer period of time; we only present the comparison of oral magnesium to placebo from this study. The quality of evidence was very low with uncertainty of the estimation.The eight-hourly dose levels in the two studies of intravenous magnesium were different; one used 100 mg/kg while the second used 40 mg/kg. Only one of these studies (n = 104) reported the mean daily pain score while hospitalised (a non-significant difference between groups, moderate quality evidence). The second study (n = 202) reported a number of child- and parent-reported quality of life scores. None of the scores showed any difference between treatment groups (low quality evidence). Data from one study (n = 106) showed no difference in length of stay in hospital between groups (low quality evidence). Both studies reported on adverse events, but not defined by severity as we had planned. One study showed significantly more participants receiving intravenous magnesium experienced warmth at infusion site compared to placebo; there were no differences between groups for other adverse events (low quality evidence).Three studies (n = 80) compared oral magnesium pidolate to placebo. None of them reported data which we were able to analyse. One study (n = 24) reported on the number of painful days and stated there was no difference between two groups (low quality evidence). None of the studies reported on quality of life or length of hospital stay. Two studies (n = 68) reported there were no differences in levels of magnesium in either plasma or red blood cells (moderate quality evidence). Two studies (n = 56) reported adverse events. One reported episodes of mild diarrhoea and headache, all of which resolved without stopping treatment. The second study reported adverse events as gastrointestinal disorders, headache or migraine, upper respiratory infections and rash; which were all evenly distributed across treatment groups (moderate quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to low quality evidence showed neither intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium therapy has an effect on reducing painful crisis, length of hospital stay and changing quality of life in treating sickle cell disease. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding its clinical benefit. Further randomized controlled studies, perhaps multicentre, are necessary to establish whether intravenous and oral magnesium therapies have any effect on improving the health of people with sickle cell disease.
29222285	Five lessons learned about long-term pain management in adults with sickle cell disease.	Chronic pain affects one-half of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite the prevalence of chronic pain, few studies have been performed to determine the best practices for this patient population. Although the pathophysiology of chronic pain in SCD may be different from other chronic pain syndromes, many of the guidelines outlined in the pain literature and elsewhere are applicable; some were consensus-adopted in the 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute SCD Guidelines. Recommended practices, such as controlled substance agreements and monitoring of urine, may seem unnecessary or counterproductive to hematologists. After all, SCD is a severe pain disorder with a clear indication for opioids, and mistrust is already a major issue. The problem, however, is not with a particular disease but with the medicines, leading many US states to pass broad legislation in attempts to curb opioid misuse. These regulations and other key tenets of chronic pain management are not meant to deprive adults with SCD of appropriate therapies, and their implementation into hematology clinics should not affect patient-provider relationships. They simply encourage prudent prescribing practices and discourage misuse, and should be seen as an opportunity to more effectively manage our patient's pain in the safest manner possible. In line with guideline recommendations as well as newer legislation, we present five lessons learned. These lessons form the basis for our model to manage chronic pain in adults with SCD.
32202252	Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update.	Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.
37169288	Female Reproductive Health Outcomes after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease: Is Reduced Intensity Better Than Myeloablative Conditioning?	Curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with a high level of risk for treatment-related gonadal dysfunction and future infertility. Both the myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens used for SCD HCT are considered to carry a high risk for ovarian damage. Cyclophosphamide equivalent doses (CEDs) are thought to correlate with the degree of gonadal damage in pediatric oncology patients. We aimed to evaluate ovarian outcomes previously reported from our center, characterize the conditioning regimens as MAC or RIC, and calculate the CED for each regimen. The ovarian outcomes diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), as determined by an anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) below the normal limits for age and assay or <5%, and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), defined as a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level >40 mIU/ML, are presented by conditioning regimen from 3 clinical studies from our center (2 published and 1 presented as an abstract in 2022). The studies were not mutually exclusive of patients. CEDs were calculated for each regimen. The CED ranged from 3388 to 9705 mg/m2 for MAC regimens and from 5600 to 18,750 mg/m2 for RIC regimens. DOR was observed in all regimens; however, in one study 2 patients had normal AMH levels after a fludarabine/melphalan regimen, and 1 patient had a normal AMH level after a fludarabine/melphalan/thiotepa regimen. Rates of POI were more variable and ranged from 40% to 100% after MAC regimens and from 0 to 100% after RIC regimens. Female patients with SCD who undergo HCT have very high rates of DOR after both MAC HCT and RIC HCT. Two of the 3 RIC regimens evaluated had higher CEDs than were seen in any of the MAC regimens evaluated. Rates of POI were more variable but may increase with time from transplantation. All SCD patients need to be counseled about the risk of infertility and provided information about fertility preservation.
29176462	Feasibility and Acceptability of Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain in Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease and Their Parents.	Pain is a clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), and is rarely optimally managed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain has been effectively delivered through the Internet in other pediatric populations. We tested feasibility and acceptability of an Internet-delivered CBT intervention in 25 adolescents with SCD (64% female, mean age=14.8 y) and their parents randomized to Internet CBT (n=15) or Internet Pain Education (n=10). Participants completed pretreatment/posttreatment measures. Eight dyads completed semistructured interviews to evaluate treatment acceptability. Feasibility indicators included recruitment and participation rates, engagement and adherence to intervention, and completion of outcome measures. In total, 87 referrals were received from 9 study sites; our recruitment rate was 60% from those families approached for screening. Among participants, high levels of initial intervention engagement (>90%), and adherence (>70%) were demonstrated. Most participants completed posttreatment outcome and diary measures (>75%). Retention at posttreatment was 80%. High treatment acceptability was reported in interviews. Our findings suggest that Internet-delivered CBT for SCD pain is feasible and acceptable to adolescents with SCD and their parents. Engagement and adherence were good. Next steps are to modify recruitment plans to enhance enrollment and determine efficacy of Internet CBT for SCD pain in a large multisite randomized controlled trial.
35180760	Peripheral Blood Smear Detection of Asymptomatic Central Line Infection in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder which may be managed by chronic red cell transfusion including exchange transfusion. Chronic indwelling vascular catheters including ports offer convenient and reliable access for red cell exchange but confer risk of complications including infection and thrombosis. Detection of these complications is essential for preserving vascular access and relies on both clinical and laboratory observation. Here we describe a case of asymptomatic port infection detected by manual screening of a peripheral blood smear.
30152184	Red blood cell transfusion therapy for sickle cell patients with frequent painful events.	BACKGROUND: Recurrent pain events or chronic pain are among the most common complications of sickle cell disease. Despite attempts to maximize adherence to and dosing of hydroxyurea, some patients continue to suffer from pain. Our institution developed a program to initiate chronic red blood cell transfusions for one year in patients clinically deemed to have high healthcare utilization from sickle cell pain, despite being prescribed hydroxyurea. PROCEDURE: An institutional review board approved retrospective study to evaluate the health outcomes associated with a one-year red blood cell transfusion protocol in sickle cell patients experiencing recurrent pain events as compared with the health outcomes for these patients in the one year prior to receiving transfusion therapy. We performed a matched-pair analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank to determine the impact of transfusion therapy on clinic visits, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, hospitalization days, and opioid prescriptions filled. RESULTS: One year of transfusion therapy significantly reduced the number of total emergency department visits for pain (6 vs 2.5 pain visits/year, P = 0.005), mean hospitalizations for pain (3.4 vs 0.9 pain admissions/year), and mean hospital days per year for pain crisis (23.5 vs 4.5, P = 0.0001), as compared with the one year prior to transfusion therapy. We identified no significant difference in opioid prescriptions filled during the year of transfusion therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with frequent pain episodes may benefit from one year of transfusion therapy.
28000341	Heart failure in haemoglobinopathies: pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, and management.	Hereditary haemoglobinopathies, mainly beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, constitute the most common monogenic disorders in humans, and although once geographically confined, they are currently globally distributed. They are demanding clinical entities that require multidisciplinary medical management. Despite their genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, the haemoglobinopathies share several similarities in pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, therapeutic requirements, and complications, among which heart failure (HF) represents a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. However, haemoglobinopathies have generally been addressed in a rather fragmentary manner. A unifying approach focusing on the underlying similarities of HF attributes in the two main entities might contribute to their better understanding, characterization, and management. In the present review, we attempt such an approach to the pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, and management of HF in haemoglobinopathies.

31942751	Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted. MAIN RESULTS: One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sbeta0-thalassaemia, 11Sbeta+-thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.
38302121	Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.	Sickle cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].
28500860	Interventions for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD. Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits and may lower intelligence quotient. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 19 September 2016. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 06 October 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention.Three trials compared the use of regular long-term red blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children with no previous long-term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents).The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long-term red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarcts) Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124 participants, low-quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low-quality evidence).No deaths were reported in either trial.Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of: acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate-quality evidence).Long-term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate -0.54; 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants; one trial)Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low-quality evidence).We are very uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low-quality evidence).The trial did not report: comparative numbers for SCD-related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention, children (121 participants; one trial)We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts); all-cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD-related complications, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low-quality evidence). Secondary prevention, children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial)We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all-cause mortality, Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to 253.66) (very low-quality evidence).Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD-related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low-quality evidence).Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD.Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, long-term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke, and other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises).In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts. No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions.Switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts and SCD-related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention.All other evidence in this review is of very low-quality.
31226000	Inhaled corticosteroids prescriptions increased in the ED for recurrent asthma exacerbations by automated electronic reminders in the ED.	Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an electronic alert on the prescription rate of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) by ED providers for poorly controlled persistent asthmatic children.Methods: Study subjects included asthmatic patients age 4-18 presenting to the ED at Phenix Children's Hospital between February 9, 2018 and December 4, 2018, with a history of at least two previous ED visits for acute exacerbation of asthma within 365 days, no active ICS prescription within 90 days, and free from developmental delay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to prematurity, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and/or interstitial ling disease. Patients meeting these criteria triggered an electronic alert prompting the medical provider to prescribe ICS or indicate reason for not prescribing. Instruction on the alert was provided to ED attending physicians and residents by email and through several educational sessions held prior to the implementation.Results: Among 62 patients without prior ICS who were discharged home from the ED, ICS was prescribed for 48 (77%). No statistically significant differences were detected in baseline characteristics between patients discharged home from the ED with and without ICS prescription. While ICS was prescribed by a larger proportion of physicians (56%) compared to residents (42%), statistical significance was not reached. For the 14 (33%) patients who were discharged home without ICS, no reason was provided to indicate why ICS were not prescribed.Conclusion: An electronic alert incorporated into the ED workflow to populate a discharge order set is effective to initiate asthma controller medication for poorly controlled pediatric patients. Additional data describing reasons for not prescribing ICS can further refine recommendations for ICS prescriptions, and provide a comprehensive strategy to support clinical decision for pediatric asthma control in acute care settings.
31578191	Reversal of a rheologic cardiomyopathy following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Cardiac complications have been well-described in sickle cell disease; however, it has been rare to see improvements in cardiac abnormalities following any interventions. Previous work has shown no significant structural changes after treatment with hydroxyurea. The cardiac effects of red blood cell exchange transfusion (RBCx) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have not been well described. We studied 56 patients undergoing HSCT (41 HLA-matched, 15 haploidentical), of whom 32 had RBCx within 3 months before HSCT. Echocardiograms and laboratory parameters were obtained at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months following HSCT. Although hemolytic parameters and anemia improved following RBCx, there was a small increase in left ventricular volume index. Following successful HSCT, however, there were significant improvements in cardiac size, function, and diastolic filling parameters at 3 months followed by continued smaller improvements up to 1 year. There was a significant improvement in N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels and a trend toward improvement in 6-minute walk time 1 year after HSCT. The magnitude of cardiac improvement seen following HSCT was comparable to that observed following correction of a volume overload state as seen in pregnancy or after repair of chronic valvular regurgitation. Further studies in sickle cell disease patients will help delineate which cardiac complications and what level of severity should be considered indications for HSCT.
33541761	Parameters affecting successful stem cell collections for genetic therapies in sickle cell disease.	Emerging cellular therapies require the collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by apheresis for in vitro manipulation to accomplish gene addition or gene editing. These therapies require relatively large numbers of HSCs within a short time frame to generate an efficacious therapeutic product. This review focuses on the principal factors that affect collection outcomes, especially relevant to gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
31351033	Analgesic management of uncomplicated acute sickle-cell pain crisis in pediatrics: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: To capture evidence of the efficacy and safety of pharmacological analgesia for uncomplicated acute sickle-cell pain in pediatric patients compared to placebo. SOURCES OF DATA: Searches for key evidence were performed from March 1 to 31, 2018, for randomized controlled trials of pharmacological analgesia compared to placebo for uncomplicated acute sickle-cell pain in a pediatric sample. The authors searched ten scientific databases including, among others, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov for this systematic review and meta-analysis. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Four trials (n=227) were selected by the inclusion criteria (intranasal fentanyl, intravenous magnesium, arginine, and inhaled nitric oxide). The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate for each outcome. Meta-analysis of changes in the ladder of pain score (p=0.72), length-of-stay in hospital (p=0.65), and amount of narcotics used during the study (p=0.10) showed non-statistically significant differences and a lack of amelioration provided by pharmaceutical analgesics in treatment group. The adverse events reported that more participants in the intervention arm underwent pain, with statistically significant differences at the drug delivery site in studies using intranasal fentanyl and intravenous magnesium (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological analgesia appears to be uncertain in improving the intensity and providing relief of acute pain crisis in pediatric patients with sickle-cell anemia. With respect to clinical advantage, no decisive deduction about the clinical efficacy may be made regarding these medications in acute sickle-cell pain management in the pediatric age group.
32621537	Cumulative outcome of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis for sickle cell disease: a 5-year review.	To review the cumulative outcome of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles performed for prevention of sickle cell disease (SCD). Couples referred for PGD for SCD between April 2012 and October 2017 were included. Ovarian stimulation was performed using a short gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol and follicle-stimulating hormone injections. The GnRH agonist was used to trigger oocyte maturation. Oocytes were fertilised using intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Trophectoderm biopsy was performed on day 5 or 6 followed by vitrification. Genetic testing was done using pre-implantation genetic haplotyping. A total of 60 couples started 70 fresh PGD cycles (mean 1 2 cycles/couple) and underwent a total of 74 frozen-embryo-transfer (FET) cycles (mean 1 3 FET/couple). The mean (SD) female age was 33 (4 4) years and the mean (SD) anti-mullerian hormone level was 22 9 (2 8) pmol/l. The cumulative live-birth rate was 54%/PGD cycle started and 63%/couple embarking on PGD. The rate of multiple births was 8%. The cumulative outcome of PGD treatment for prevention of SCD transmission is high and PGD treatment should be offered to all at-risk couples.

28759112	Fluid replacement therapy for acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Treating vaso-occlusive painful crises in people with sickle cell disease is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids are routinely given as adjunct treatment, regardless of the individual's state of hydration with the aim of slowing or stopping the sickling process and thereby alleviating pain. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the optimal route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.We also conducted searches of Embase (November 2007), LILACS, www.ClinicalTrials.gov (05 January 2010), and the WHO ICTRP (30 June 2017).Date of most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 16 February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the administration of supplemental fluids adjunctive to analgesics by any route in people with any type of sickle cell disease during an acute painful episode, under medical supervision (inpatient, day care or community). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials have yet been identified. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials were identified by the searches, all of which were not eligible for inclusion in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Treating vaso-occlusive crises is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are no randomised controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes.
29446825	Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004, and updated in 2010, 2013, and 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 10 April 2017; ISRCTN: 26 July 2017; AMED: 24 August 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov: 02 August 2017; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan  (also known as Nicosan ) and Ciklavit  were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan  was effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality evidence). It did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). No serious adverse effects were reported. The single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises (low-quality evidence), and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in the management of people with sickle cell disease and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit . Based on the published results for Niprisan  and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing sickle cell disease.
32472448	Literacy assessment of preimplantation genetic patient education materials exceed national reading levels.	PURPOSE: In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing (IVF+PGT-M) reduces the risk of having a child affected by a heritable condition, yet only one-third of eligible patients are aware of this reproductive option. Access to education materials written at appropriate literacy levels could raise patients' awareness, but there is a mismatch between patient reading ability and the literacy demand of most materials. This study aimed to systematically identify written education materials on IVF+PGT-M and evaluate their literacy levels. We hypothesized that materials would fail to meet standards set by the Joint Commission and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). METHODS: To identify patient education materials about IVF+PGT-M from academic databases and public-facing sources, an environmental scan was performed. Materials were analyzed using three validated scales: Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, and Clear Communication Index. RESULTS: Seventeen patient education materials about IVF+PGT-M were identified from patient education databases, a consumer search engine, and professional organizations. The median reading level was 14.5 grade, median understandability was 74.2%, and median comprehensibility was 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: For most American adults, materials about IVF+PGT-M are not readable, understandable, or clear. The Joint Commission requires patient education materials be written at or below 5th grade reading level and the CDC recommends a 90% minimum score for comprehensibility. No evaluated material met these guidelines. Patient education materials that exceed average American literacy skills may perpetuate disparities in the utilization of IVF+PGT-M. Materials that communicate this complicated subject at an understandable level are needed.
33534948	Non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor transplantation in sickle cell disease: outcomes from three independent centres.	Non-myeloablative haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) from matched related donors (MRD) has been increasingly utilized in sickle cell disease (SCD). A total of 122 patients received 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI), alemtuzumab, unmanipulated filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood HPC and sirolimus. The median follow-up was four years; median age at HPCT was 29 years. Median neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred on day 22 and 19 respectively; 41 patients required no platelet transfusions. Overall and sickle-free survival at one and five years were 93% and 85% respectively. Age, sex, pre-HPCT sickle complications, ferritin and infused HPC numbers were similar between graft failure and engrafted patients. Mean donor myeloid chimaerism at one and five years post HPCT were 84% and 88%, and CD3 was 48% and 53% respectively. Two patients developed grade 1 and 2 skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with no chronic GVHD. Median days of recipients taking immunosuppression were 489; 83% of engrafted patients have discontinued immunosuppression. Haemoglobin, haemolytic parameters and hepatic iron levels improved post HPCT. Pulmonary function testing, hepatic histology and neurovascular imaging remained stable, suggesting cessation of further sickle-related injury. Fourteen patients had children. In this largest group of adult SCD patients, this regimen was highly efficacious, well-tolerated despite compromised organ functions pre HPCT, and without clinically significant GVHD.
29958564	Curative therapies: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from matched related donors using myeloablative, reduced intensity, and nonmyeloablative conditioning in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) chronically damages multiple organs over the lifetime of affected individuals. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the most studied curative intervention. Fully matched related marrow, peripheral blood derived, or cord blood HCT have the best transplant outcome for symptomatic patients with SCD. For patients with asymptomatic or milder disease who have this donor option available, risks and benefits of HCT should be discussed among the patient, family, treating hematologist, and transplant physician, and decision to proceed to HCT should be individualized. Myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ATG has been a commonly employed regimen for children and young adults. Recently, low intensity conditioning with low dose total body irradiation and alemtuzumab is emerging as an efficacious and safe regimen for adults, young adults, and possibly children. Mixed donor chimerism (minimum >=20% myeloid cells), from myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen, produces robust normal donor erythropoiesis and is sufficient to provide a clinical cure. The proportion of patients remaining on immunosuppression beyond 2 years post-HCT is likely <10% with either myeloablative or low intensity regimens. Late effects from myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning, or from several more months of immunosuppression in low intensity conditioning may be less common than those observed in HCT for malignant indications. Nonmyeloablative approaches with low toxicities should be the focus of future research efforts. Prevention of GVHD is a shared goal in all approaches of allo-HCT in SCD.
32147066	Review/overview of pain in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly complex inherited disorder of hemoglobin structure. Although the molecular lesion is a single-point mutation, the sickle gene is pleiotropic in nature causing multiple phenotypic expressions that constitute the various complications of the disease. Its manifestations could be acute, chronic, nociceptive, neuropathic that could occur singly or in various combinations. Pain continues to be the major factor of SCD phenotypic complications and the most common cause of admissions to the Emergency Department and/or the hospital. Although progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of SCD as well as in developing curative therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy, effective pain management continues to lag behind. Palliative therapies continue to be the major approach to the management of SCD and its complications. The advent of hydroxyurea made partial success in preventing the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises and l-glutamine awaits post-trial confirmation of benefits. The search for additional pharmacotherapeutic agents that could be used singly or in combination with hydroxyurea and/or l-glutamine awaits their dawn hopefully in the near future. The purpose of this review is to describe the various manifestations of SCD, their pathophysiology and their current management. Recent impressive advances in understanding the pathophysiology of pain promise the determination of agents that could replace or minimize the use of opioids.

28555355	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in children with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from an increased incidence of gallstone formation due to hemolysis of sickled red blood cells; this leads to an increased level of bilirubin in secreted bile that becomes a nidus for pigment stone formation. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is considered a standard operative procedure for gallstone disease mainly due to lower postoperative wound complaints, faster recovery, better postoperative cosmetic results, shorter hospital stay, and earlier return to work. Although numerous studies have been published addressing both the advantages and complications of LC in acute calcular cholecystitis, there is still limited evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of LC for the management of cholelithiasis in pediatric patients with SCD, and controversies remain unresolved. In this review, we aim to comprehensively study the available literature and propose evidence-based practice recommendations for the optimal management of gallstones in pediatric SCD patients. The current practice differs greatly depending on the prevalence of SCD in a particular geographic area. We acknowledge the limited number of patients reported, the lack of randomized control trials addressing the practice of specific recommendations, and the need for further evidence-based studies.
38786070	Current and Future Therapeutics for Treating Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic blood disorder in the United States, with over 100,000 people suffering from this debilitating disease. SCD is caused by abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) variants that interfere with normal red blood cell (RBC) function. Research on SCD has led to the development and approval of several new SCD therapies in recent years. The recent FDA-approved novel gene therapies are potentially curative, giving patients an additional option besides a hematopoietic bone marrow transplant. Despite the promise of existing therapies, questions remain regarding their long-term pharmacological effects on adults and children. These questions, along with the exorbitant cost of the new gene therapies, justify additional research into more effective therapeutic options. Continual research in this field focuses on not only developing cheaper, more effective cures/treatments but also investigating the physiological effects of the current therapies on SCD patients, particularly on the brain and kidneys. In this article, we undertake a comprehensive review of ongoing clinical trials with completion dates in 2024 or later. Our exploration provides insights into the landscape of current therapeutics and emerging novel therapies designed to combat and potentially eradicate SCD, including the latest FDA-approved gene therapies.
34628962	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: PATIENT SELEction and Timing Based on Sickle Cell-Related Multiple Chronic Conditions.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although most SCD patients experience progressive end-organ damage and shortened lifespans, not all patients follow the same disease course, tempo, or outcome. Therefore, the dilemma facing physicians is weighing the selection of patients and timing for the procedure against donor type and transplant-related mortality and morbidity that go up with increasing age. On the other hand, the dilemma facing the patients and families is how acceptable HSCT that carries some mortality risks to them. We have analyzed the chronic conditions due to SCD in 449 patients to determine whether SCD-related multiple chronic conditions (MCC) can be risk-stratified to identify the group of patients predicted to not only have shortened lifespans but also functional limitation and poor quality of life so that these at-risk patients can be offered HSCT early and before MCC develops. We identified that the age of onset of the first SCD-related chronic conditions strongly predicted for the risks for disease-related MCC. SCD patients who suffered their first disease-related chronic condition before age 30 years developed MCC at a rate of 19.1 times faster than those at a later age. These patients are therefore high-risk patients and should be offered HSCT early in the course of their disease before multiple organ damage intervenes, even if matched-related donors are not available. This patient selection and timing approach provides a forum for an easy-to-understand and real-time discussion, including the choice of donor type, with SCD patients and families when considering HSCT.
36866433	Case report: Successful treatment with plasma exchange in life-threatening hyperhemolytic syndrome unrelated to sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Hyperhemolytic syndrome (HHS) is a severe form of delayed transfusion reaction primarily described in sickle cell anemia patients which is characterized by a hemoglobin decrease to pre-transfusion levels or lower, often with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of auto- or allo-antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of severe HHS in patients without sickle cell anemia refractory to treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins, and rituximab. In one case, temporary relief was achieved with eculizumab. In both cases, plasma exchange resulted in a profound and immediate response allowing for splenectomy and resolution of hemolysis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We discuss the pathophysiology of HHS, its presentation and treatment and expand on the possible role of plasma exchange in this setting.
34550643	How I approach disease-modifying therapy in children with sickle cell disease in an era of novel therapies.	Finally,after decades of stagnation, the therapeutic landscape for sickle cell disease (SCD) is changing with an increasing number of novel therapeutics. Hydroxyurea remains the primary disease-modifying therapy and, when started early in life with maintenance of an optimal dose, can reduce many SCD-related complications. To complement hydroxyurea, there are a growing number of pharmacologic options with additional efforts focused on the development and optimization of curative therapies. Here, we review current treatment options and provide recommendations as to how to approach the treatment of children and adolescents within this evolving therapeutic landscape to allow for full and healthy lives.
32202244	Status quo of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease using matched unrelated donors.	This mini review is based on an oral presentation reflecting the current status quo of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) using matched unrelated donors (MUDs) presented at the EBMT Sickle Disease Meeting held in Regensburg, Germany, in May 2019. Although the clinical trial landscape for MUD HSCT in patients with SCD is limited to date, some attempts to improve patient outcome in terms of overall survival and event-free survival have been made recently, including optimization of conditioning regimens and prevention of engraftment failure as well as graft-versus-host disease. The results achieved by these approaches are summarized in this review and are still unsatisfactory. Whether new haploidentical transplantation protocols will achieve superior results and are able to replace MUD HSCT for patients with SCD remains to be elucidated.
30757919	The use of bevacizumab in pediatric retinal and choroidal disease: A review.	The use of intravitreal bevacizumab in pediatric retinal and uveitic disease has become more widespread over the past decade. This article serves to outline the rationale underlying the use of intravitreal bevacizumab, and which disease entities it should be appropriately thought of as a primary or solo therapy, as opposed to an adjuvant one. Also presented is the relevant literature regarding each of these retinopathies.
29255068	Red cell exchange transfusions lower cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction in pediatric sickle cell anemia.	Blood transfusions are the mainstay of stroke prevention in pediatric sickle cell anemia (SCA), but the physiology conferring this benefit is unclear. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) are elevated in SCA, likely compensating for reduced arterial oxygen content (CaO2). We hypothesized that exchange transfusions would decrease CBF and OEF by increasing CaO2, thereby relieving cerebral oxygen metabolic stress. Twenty-one children with SCA receiving chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and after exchange transfusions. Arterial spin labeling and asymmetric spin echo sequences measured CBF and OEF, respectively, which were compared pre- and posttransfusion. Volumes of tissue with OEF above successive thresholds (36%, 38%, and 40%), as a metric of regional metabolic stress, were compared pre- and posttransfusion. Transfusions increased hemoglobin (Hb; from 9.1 to 10.3 g/dL; P < .001) and decreased Hb S (from 39.7% to 24.3%; P < .001). Transfusions reduced CBF (from 88 to 82.4 mL/100 g per minute; P = .004) and OEF (from 34.4% to 31.2%; P < .001). At all thresholds, transfusions reduced the volume of peak OEF found in the deep white matter, a location at high infarct risk in SCA (P < .001). Reduction of elevated CBF and OEF, both globally and regionally, suggests that CTT mitigates infarct risk in pediatric SCA by relieving cerebral metabolic stress at patient- and tissue-specific levels.
34889371	Evidence-Based Minireview: In young children with severe sickle cell disease, do the benefits of HLA-identical sibling donor HCT outweigh the risks?	In case 1, a 14-month-old male child with sickle cell disease (SCD) was referred for evaluation for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The patient had a history of dactylitis 3 times in his first year of life and febrile episodes twice at the consult. His 4-year-old sister was found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical. The patient was started on hydroxyurea (HU) at 2.5 years of age. His parents again sought consultation when he was 5 years old because of concerns about his medical condition. At the time, the patient had experienced 2 vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOEs) requiring hospitalization during the previous 2 years. He had also experienced intermittent pain crises requiring rest at home for 2 to 3 days. The child has not attended school in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The family is considering HCT but is ambivalent about it because of potential toxicity. In case 2, an 8-year-old female child is 3 years out from HCT for SCD from her HLA-identical sibling. Before HCT, despite receiving HU, she had experienced >5 VOEs requiring hospitalization and 2 episodes of acute chest syndromes in the previous 3 years. She had also been missing almost 50 days of school days each year. After HCT, she is now attending school regularly and participating in all normal age-appropriate activities. The parents believe that HCT has been transformative in their child's life.
32797735	Role of prophylactic and therapeutic red blood cell exchange in pregnancy with sickle cell disease: Maternal and perinatal outcomes.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of fetomaternal complications during pregnancy is high for women with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is the most common hematologic genetic disorder worldwide. Prophylactic red blood cell exchange (pRBCX) has been shown to be efficient, safe, and feasible for preventing complications. The aim of this study was to observe maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies in which pRBCX was. METHOD: This was a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study, which recruited 46 consecutive adult pregnant women with SCD between January 2012 and June 2019. Obstetric features, SCD-related complications, and fetomaternal outcomes were compared between the 27 patients who received prophylactic exchange and the 19 who did not (therapeutic exchange was performed in 7 and was not performed in 12 cases). RESULTS: Painful crises, preeclampsia, and preterm birth rates were significantly higher in the group that did not receive prophylactic exchange (control group; P = .001, P = .024, and P = .027, respectively). There was one maternal mortality in the control group (P = .41). Incidence of adverse fetal or maternal complications was significantly higher in the control group (P = .044 and P = .007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our center's experience over a 7.5-year period, as described above, demonstrates that pRBCX in SCD affects the course of pregnancy positively by ameliorating negative fetomaternal outcomes.
35260961	Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Improve Patient Experience Among Adults During Transitions from Hospital to Home: the PArTNER study.	INTRODUCTION: Minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) need evidence-based strategies tailored to the populations they serve to improve patient-centered outcomes after hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) from October 2014 to January 2017 at a MSH comparing the effectiveness of a stakeholder-supported Navigator intervention vs. Usual care on post-hospital patient experience, outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Community health workers and peer coaches delivered the intervention which included (1) in-hospital visits to assess barriers to health/healthcare and to develop a personalized Discharge Patient Education Tool (DPET); (2) a home visit to review the DPET; and (3) telephone-based peer coaching. The co-primary outcomes were between-group comparisons of 30-day changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of anxiety and informational support (minimum important difference is 2 to 5 units change); a p-value <0.025 was considered significant using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included death, ED visits, or readmissions and measures of emotional, social, and physical health at 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 1029 adults hospitalized with heart failure (28%), pneumonia (22%), MI (10%), COPD (11%), or sickle cell disease (29%). Over 80% were non-Hispanic Black. Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in the 30-day change in anxiety (adjusted difference: -1.6, 97.5% CI -3.3 to 0.1, p=0.03), informational support (adjusted difference: -0.01, 97.5% CI -2.0 to 1.9, p=0.99), or any secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggested the Navigator intervention improved anxiety among participants with COPD, a primary care provider, a hospitalization in the past 12 months, or higher baseline anxiety; among participants without health insurance, the intervention improved informational support (all p-values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic RCT at a MSH, the Navigator intervention did not improve post-hospital anxiety, informational support, or other outcomes compared to Usual care. Benefits observed in participant subgroups should be confirmed in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02114515.
29472357	Plerixafor enables safe, rapid, efficient mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells in sickle cell disease patients after exchange transfusion.	Sickle cell disease is characterized by chronic anemia and vaso-occlusive crises, which eventually lead to multi-organ damage and premature death. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment but it is limited by toxicity and poor availability of HLA-compatible donors. A gene therapy approach based on the autologous transplantation of lentiviral-corrected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was shown to be efficacious in one patient. However, alterations of the bone marrow environment and properties of the red blood cells hamper the harvesting and immunoselection of patients' stem cells from bone marrow. The use of Filgrastim to mobilize large numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into the circulation has been associated with severe adverse events in sickle cell patients. Thus, broader application of the gene therapy approach requires the development of alternative mobilization methods. We set up a phase I/II clinical trial whose primary objective was to assess the safety of a single injection of Plerixafor in sickle cell patients undergoing red blood cell exchange to decrease the hemoglobin S level to below 30%. The secondary objective was to measure the efficiency of mobilization and isolation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. No adverse events were observed. Large numbers of CD34+ cells were mobilized extremely quickly. Importantly, the mobilized cells contained high numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, expressed high levels of stemness genes, and engrafted very efficiently in immunodeficient mice. Thus, Plerixafor can be safely used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells in sickle cell patients; this finding opens up new avenues for treatment approaches based on gene addition and genome editing. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02212535.
30001893	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease: An experience of the Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON).	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A recently occurring increase of the prevalence of haemoglobinopathies, beta-thalassaemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) over the last two decades in our country has generated new needs in terms of medical resources for both prevention and treatment of these patients. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment available for patients who have severe haemoglobinopathies. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the results of allo-HSCT in paediatric patients with TM or SCD performed in paediatric hematopoietic transplant units within the Spanish Group of Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing HSCT in the GETMON units until 2015. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were analysed (43 patients were affected with TM and 22 with SCD), who received allo-HSCT in 6 GETMON units between November 1989 and December 2014. Event-free survival three years post-transplant was 81% and overall survival 92% in patients with TM. Event-free survival three years post-transplant was 79% and overall survival 85% in patients with SCD. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this series are comparable to the results of other international series and offer a platform from which to continue trying to improve the evolution of these patients.
32428732	CTLA4Ig in an Extended Schedule along with Sirolimus Improves Outcome with a Distinct Pattern of Immune Reconstitution Following Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide-Based Haploidentical Transplantation for Hemoglobinopathies.	The major hindrances to the success of a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation for hemoglobinopathies are graft failure, early post-transplant hemophagocytic syndrome (PTHPS), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Following the successful incorporation of CTLA4Ig (abatacept) in post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-based haploidentical transplantation, we piloted this approach in 10 patients (aged 3 to 19 years), with thalassemia major (TM, n=5) and sickle cell disease (n = 5). Pretransplant immunosuppressive therapy (pTIST) was administered for 10 weeks. Conditioning was myeloablative. CTLA4Ig was administered every 2 weeks during pTIST and on days -1, +5, +20, and +35 and every 4 weeks thereafter for 6 months, along with sirolimus. A short course of low-dose dexamethasone was given from day +6 for 14 days. Nine patients engrafted at a median of 15 days, with 1 patient with TM dying of sepsis on day +19. None of the patients developed acute or chronic GVHD. All 9 patients are alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 28 months. Only 4 patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation. The pattern of immune reconstitution showed a prompt and sustained recovery of T cell subsets with memory phenotype, along with early and sustained increase of Tregs and NKG2C+ natural killer (NK) cells. This novel approach, targeting CD80 and CD86 on monocytes/macrophages, promoted engraftment and limited early-onset PTHPS and graft failure. The lack of GVHD and serious infections with this approach reflects an early recovery of Tregs, memory T cells, and persistence of NKG2C+ NK cells.
34200975	Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing.	Hereditary anemia has various manifestations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD), and thalassemia. The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.
28541013	Gene Therapy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease.	
30702538	Exploring Emergency Department Provider Experiences With and Perceptions of Weight-Based Versus Individualized Vaso-Occlusive Treatment Protocols in Sickle Cell Disease.	Treatment of vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) is the most common reason for emergency department (ED) treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). We (1) compared perceptions of the usability and ability to manage VOE pain between ED nurses and other ED provider types, ED sites, and VOE protocols (individualized vs. weight-based), and (2) identified ED nurse and other provider protocol suggestions. A secondary analysis of provider survey data collected immediately after caring for a patient enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing weight-based versus individualized opioid dosing for VOE. Research staff asked the ED nurses and other ED providers (nurse practitioners [NPs], physician assistants [PAs], residents, and attending physicians) 5 questions related to the protocol's ease of use and ability to manage pain. There were 236 surveys completed. Attending physicians (n = 15), residents (n = 88), PAs (n = 21), and NPs (n = l) were more satisfied than nurses (n = 111) with the clarity of the analgesic ordering (97.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.0001) and ability to manage the patient's VOE pain (91% vs. 0%, p = 0.0001). When comparing both protocols with the usual ED strategy in their ED to manage VOE, more nurses than other ED providers perceived the study patients' pain management protocol as better (100% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.0001). Other ED providers perceived the individualized versus weight-based protocol as better at managing pain than their usual ED strategy (70.3% vs. 59.5%, p = 0.04). The individualized protocol was perceived as better in managing VOE than the weight-based ED strategy. While physicians were satisfied with the clarity of the protocols, nurses were not. Improved protocol usability is required for widespread ED implementation.
37072548	Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Arterial Ischemic Stroke.	Though rare, stroke in infants and children is an important cause of mortality and chronic morbidity in the pediatric population. Neuroimaging advances and implementation of pediatric stroke care protocols have led to the ability to rapidly diagnose stroke and in many cases determine the stroke etiology. Though data on efficacy of hyperacute therapies, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, in pediatric stroke are limited, feasibility and safety data are mounting and support careful consideration of these treatments for childhood stroke. Recent therapeutic advances allow for targeted stroke prevention efforts in high-risk conditions, such as moyamoya, sickle cell disease, cardiac disease, and genetic disorders. Despite these exciting advances, important knowledge gaps persist, including optimal dosing and type of thrombolytic agents, inclusion criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, the role of immunomodulatory therapies for focal cerebral arteriopathy, optimal long-term antithrombotic strategies, the role of patent foramen ovale closure in pediatric stroke, and optimal rehabilitation strategies after stroke of the developing brain.
33176303	Hyperhaemolytic Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease: Clearing the Cobwebs.	"Sickle cell disease (SCD) presents with a dynamic background of haemolysis and deepening anaemia. This increases the demand for transfusion if any additional strain on haemopoiesis is encountered due to any other physiological or pathological causes. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents are placed on chronic blood transfusion; those with acute sequestration and acute chest syndrome are likewise managed with blood transfusion. These patients are prone to develop complications of blood transfusion including alloimmunization and hyperhaemolytic syndrome (HHS). This term is used to describe haemolysis of both transfused and ""own"" red cells occurring during or post-transfusion in sickle cell patients. Hyperhaemolysis results in worsening post-transfusion haemoglobin due attendant haemolysis of both transfused and autologous red cells. The mechanism underlying this rare and usually fatal complication of SCD has been thought to be secondary to changes in the red cell membrane with associated immunological reactions against exposed cell membrane phospholipids. The predisposition to HHS in sickle cell is also varied and the search for a prediction pattern or value has been evasive. This review discusses the pathogenesis, risk factors and treatment of HHS, elaborating on what is known of this rare condition."
28756377	Thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in adults with homozygous sickle cell disease.	Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). A specific large-vessel vasculopathy is often responsible for both haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes in patients with SCD. Although intravenous thrombolysis has been considered as a therapeutic option for acute ischaemic strokes in SCD, its use remains debated because of an increased risk of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage reported in this disease. This risk of haemorrhage is mainly supported by the presence of a Moyamoya syndrome often associated with the specific vasculopathy in patients with homozygous SCD. We report two cases of patients with homozygous SCD treated with intravenous thrombolysis for an acute ischaemic stroke without haemorrhagic transformation. Our cases suggest that reperfusion strategy in acute ischaemic stroke in patients with homozygous SCD can be considered once associated Moyamoya syndrome has been ruled out. An international registry would be of interest as these situations are rare.
32469414	Assessment of Patient and Caregiver Attitudes and Approaches to Decision-Making Regarding Bone Marrow Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: A Qualitative Study.	Importance: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is a potentially curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patient and caregiver attitudes toward BMT for SCD and the willingness to accept risks of BMT vary, but these attitudes are not well understood. Objective: To understand patient and caregiver perceptions of and attitudes toward BMT for SCD and decision-making about BMT. Design, Setting, and Participants: Qualitative study of interview transcripts from a convenience sample. Transcripts were from adults with SCD and caregivers of patients with SCD recruited from national and regional SCD conferences, symposia, and sickle cell clinics in 2 cities. Interview transcripts were used from the needs assessment phase to develop a patient-decision aid in 2013 to 2014 (group 1) and from the baseline point in 2015 to 2016 (group 2) of the parent trial, a randomized clinical trial of adults and caregivers of patients with SCD to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient decision aid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant perspectives on decision-making regarding BMT for SCD. Results: Fifty-seven transcripts from adults with SCD and 50 transcripts from caregivers of patients with SCD were included. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of adults with SCD was 34 (21-50) years in group 1 and 30 (23-38) years in group 2. The median (IQR) age of caregivers was 42.5 (31-52) years in group 1 and 41 (35-46.5) years in group 2. Most transcripts from adults with SCD (75.0% in group 1 and 72.4% in group 2) and caregivers of patients with SCD (76.7% in group 1 and 85.0% in group 2) were from female participants. Bone marrow transplant was perceived as a treatment option associated with serious risks. Reported attitudes toward BMT occurred on a continuum ranging from unfavorable to favorable. Participants reported serious decisional dilemma regarding BMT for SCD. Most participants expressed interest in learning about BMT or curative treatments. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study found a continuum in attitudes toward BMT for SCD and highlights the complexity of decision-making in BMT for SCD. Patients and families with SCD expressed an interest in learning about BMT. Future prospective studies of patient decision-making regarding BMT, especially in the context of emerging curative and novel disease-modifying therapies for SCD, are warranted.
29603363	Transfusion-related adverse events are decreased in pregnant women with sickle cell disease by a change in policy from systematic transfusion to prophylactic oxygen therapy at home: A retrospective survey by the international sickle cell disease observatory.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy can be associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Furthermore, complications of SCD can be aggravated by pregnancy. Optimal prenatal care aims to decrease the occurrence of maternal and fetal complications. A retrospective, French, two-center study compared two care strategies for pregnant women with SCD over two time periods. In the first study period (2005-2010), the women were systematically offered prophylactic transfusions. In the second study period (2011-2014), a targeted transfusion strategy was applied whenever possible, and home-based prophylactic nocturnal oxygen therapy was offered to all the pregnant women. The two periods did not differ significantly in terms of the incidence of vaso-occlusive events. Maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, and obstetric complication rates were also similar in the two periods, as was the incidence of post-transfusion complications (6.1% in 2005-2010 and 1.3% in 2011-2014, P = .15), although no de novo alloimmunizations or delayed hemolysis transfusion reactions were observed in the second period. The results of this preliminary, retrospective study indicate that targeted transfusion plus home-based prophylactic nocturnal oxygen therapy is safe and may decrease transfusion requirements and transfusion-associated complications.
30893113	Impact of Sickle Cell Anemia on Inpatient Morbidity After Spinal Fusion.	STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of sickle cell anemia on perioperative outcomes and resource utilization in elective spinal fusion surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sickle cell anemia has been identified as an important surgical risk factor in otolaryngology, cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, and total joint arthroplasty. However, the impact of sickle cell anemia on elective spine surgery is unknown. METHODS: Hospitalizations for elective spinal fusion surgery between the years of 2001-2014 from the US National Inpatient Sample were identified using ICD-9-CM codes and patients were grouped into those with and without sickle cell anemia. The main outcome measures were in-hospital neurological, respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal and urinary, pulmonary embolism, and wound-related complications and mortality. Length of stay and inpatient costs were also collected. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to compare the in-hospital outcomes of patients undergoing elective spinal fusion with or without sickle cell anemia. RESULTS: From a total of 4,542,719 patients undergoing elective spinal fusions from 2001 to 2014, 456 sickle cell disease patients were identified. Sickle cell anemia is a significant independent predictor for pulmonary embolism [odds ratio (OR)=7.37; confidence interval (CI), 4.27-12.71; P<0.001], respiratory complications (OR=2.36; CI, 1.63-3.42; P<0.001), wound complications (OR=3.84; CI, 2.72-5.44; P<0.001), and overall inpatient complications (OR=2.58; CI, 2.05-3.25; P<0.001). Sickle cell anemia patients also have significantly longer length of stay (7.0 vs. 3.8 d; P<0.001) and higher inpatient costs ($20,794 vs. $17,608 P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell anemia is associated with increased risk of perioperative complications and greater health care resource utilization. Sickle cell anemia patients undergoing spinal fusion surgeries should be counseled on these increased risks. Moreover, current strategies for perioperative management of sickle cell anemia patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery need to be improved.

37309792	[Therapeutic approaches in sickle cell disease].	THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.
28988213	Management of pneumatosis intestinalis in children over the age of 6 months: a conservative approach.	BACKGROUND: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is an uncommon and poorly understood condition. Although it can be an incidental finding in asymptomatic individuals, it can also be secondary to life-threatening bowel ischaemia and sepsis. In premature infants, it is a pathognomonic sign of necrotising enterocolitis. There is no consensus regarding management and long-term outcome of children with PI. AIM: Review of our experience of PI in children beyond the early infantile period. METHODS: Retrospective review of patient's records and radiological images from 2013 to 2015. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (three girls) had radiologically confirmed PI. The median age was 4.5 years (range 8 months-13 years). Background medical conditions (number): short bowel syndrome (one), congenital heart disease (two), sickle cell disease (one), epilepsy (three), cerebral palsy (six), myotonic dystrophy (four) and peroxisomal biogenesis defect (one).Six children (33%) presented with abdominal distension, four (22%) with abdominal pain, three (17%) with bilious vomiting, two (11%) with diarrhoea and one (6%) with rectal bleeding. Two (11%) were asymptomatic. One had air in portal vein and two had pneumoperitoneum.All patients with symptomatic PI were treated conservatively with successful outcome and complete resolution of PI. None required surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: PI in children who are not on chemotherapy or immunosuppressant appears to follow a benign course and is responsive to conservative management. In contrast to adults, portal venous gas and pneumoperitoneum do not predict the need for surgical intervention.
36018254	Simple open-heart surgery protocol for sickle-cell disease patients: a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are considered to be at high risk from open-heart surgery. This study assessed the role of a simple sickling-prevention protocol. METHODS: Perioperative non-specific and SCD-specific morbidity and 30-day mortality are investigated in a retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery. Patients with and without SCD were compared. In the SCD cohort, a bundle of interventions was applied to limit the risk of sickling: 'on-demand' transfusions to keep haemoglobin levels of around 7-8 g/dl, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with higher blood flow and perfusion temperature, close monitoring of acid-base balance and oxygenation. RESULTS: Twenty patients with and 40 patients without SCD were included. At baseline, only preoperative haemoglobin levels differed between cohorts (8.1 vs 11.8 g/dl, P < 0.001). Solely SCD patients received preoperative transfusions (45.0%). Intraoperative transfusions were significantly larger in SCD patients during CPB (priming: 300 vs 200 ml; entire length: 600 vs 300 ml and 20 vs 10 ml/kg). SCD patients had higher perfusion temperatures during CPB (34.7 vs 33.0 C, P = 0.01) with consequently higher pharyngeal temperature, both during cooling (34.1 vs 32.3 C, P = 0.02) and rewarming (36.5 vs 36.2 C, P = 0.02). No mortality occurred, and non-SCD-specific complications were comparable between groups, but one SCD patient suffered from perioperative cerebrovascular accident with seizures, and another had evident haemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: SCD patients may undergo open-heart surgery for mitral valve procedures with an acceptable risk profile. Simple but thoughtful perioperative management, embracing 'on-demand' transfusions and less-aggressive CPB cooling is feasible and probably efficacious.
38682445	Optimization of single-needle red cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease.	"The hypercoagulable state associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) can be challenging for apheresis procedures. Among 62 single-needle red cell exchanges (SN-RCEs) performed over a 15-month period, 4 patients experienced 6 hemolytic events with a discolored plasma layer, elevated plasma/RBC interface in the centrifuge, and accompanying alarms of ""Cells were detected in plasma line from centrifuge"" or ""AIM system detected RBC at top of connector."" The hemolysis originated from the apheresis instrument because samples from the apheresis belt but not the patients' peripheral blood were positive for hemolysis. Further analysis showed the alarms occurred more often in SN-RCEs (20.4%) than double-needle RCEs (2.7%), and the hemolysis was probably secondary to clumping. To optimize SN-RCE, we increased the anticoagulant dosage by changing Inlet/AC ratio from 13 to 8 and lowered the inlet rate to the level comparable to double-needle RCE. The adjustments were well-tolerated with no more hemolysis."

29222303	Responsiveness of Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain domains and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures in children and adults with sickle cell disease.	Case 1: A 33-year-old man with hemoglobin SS (homozygous hemoglobin S) disease presents for his regular clinic visit. He had 6 hospital admissions for pain over the past year. He also has avascular necrosis of the right hip. He takes daily hydroxyurea with hematologic changes indicative of compliance. He also takes morphine sustained release twice daily and morphine immediate release every 6 hours as needed for pain. He feels that more optimal pain control at home would help him reduce his number of hospital admissions in the upcoming year and improve his daily functioning at home. His hematologist decides to use Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-ME) to follow changes in the patient's pain. Case 2: An 11-year-old girl with hemoglobin SS disease presents with her mother for her regular clinic visit. She had 2 admissions for pain over the past year. Her mother is concerned because she has been participating less in activities she previously enjoyed and missing classes to go to the school nurse because of pain. She is currently taking hydroxyurea and uses ibuprofen for pain. Her doctor prescribes morphine for home use but wants a way to measure if it is effective in improving her pain. Thus, her physician decides to use PROMIS and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory SCD (PedsQL SCD) module to determine the effectiveness of her pain control.

32200490	A Comprehensive Review of the Treatment and Management of Pain in Sickle Cell Disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder which leads to serious complications in multiple organ systems. While significant research has addressed many of the effects of acute pain episodes and end-organ damage connected to this disease, little has approached the chronic pain state associated with this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Associated chronic pain represents a significant detractor from the quality of life experienced by these patients, affecting over half of those with SCD on more days than not. Current treatment typically is centered upon preventing and responding to acute vasoocclusive crises, presumably because this is the most common reason for hospitalization in these patients. The lack of management of chronic pain symptoms leaves many with SCD in a state of suffering. In this review, the treatment methodologies of SCD patients are examined including alternative treatments, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical, as well as procedural approaches specifically aimed at reducing chronic pain in these patients.
33877274	Effect of Poloxamer 188 vs Placebo on Painful Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in Children and Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Although effective agents are available to prevent painful vaso-occlusive episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no disease-modifying therapies for ongoing painful vaso-occlusive episodes; treatment remains supportive. A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea. Objective: To reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial conducted from May 2013 to February 2016 that included 66 hospitals in 12 countries and 60 cities; 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-beta0 thalassemia, or S-beta+ thalassemia disease) aged 4 to 65 years with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included. Interventions: A 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 intravenously followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants and among those younger than 16 years as a separate subgroup. Results: Of 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), the primary outcome was available for 384 (99.0%), 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.8%). There was no significant difference between the groups for the mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids (81.8 h for the poloxamer 188 group vs 77.8 h for the placebo group; difference, 4.0 h [95% CI, -7.8 to 15.7]; geometric mean ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.5]; P = .09). Based on a significant interaction of age and treatment (P = .01), there was a treatment difference in time from randomization to last administration of parenteral opioids for participants younger than 16 years (88.7 h in the poloxamer 188 group vs 71.9 h in the placebo group; difference, 16.8 h [95% CI, 1.7-32.0]; geometric mean ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8]; P = .008). Adverse events that were more common in the poloxamer 188 group than the placebo group included hyperbilirubinemia (12.7% vs 5.2%); those more common in the placebo group included hypoxia (12.0% vs 5.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children and adults with SCD, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes. These findings do not support the use of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01737814.

36606705	Intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department among children with sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive pain: A multicenter pediatric emergency medicine perspective.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly experience vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE) due to sickling of erythrocytes, which often requires care in the emergency department. Our objective was to assess the use and impact of intranasal fentanyl for the treatment of children with SCD-VOE on discharge from the emergency department in a multicenter study. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 20 academic pediatric emergency departments in the United States and Canada. We used logistic regression to test bivariable and multivariable associations between the outcome of discharge from the emergency department and candidate variables theoretically associated with discharge. The study included 400 patients; 215 (54%) were female. The median age was 14.6 (interquartile range 9.8, 17.6) years. Nineteen percent (n = 75) received intranasal fentanyl in the emergency department. Children who received intranasal fentanyl had nearly nine-fold greater adjusted odds of discharge from the emergency department compared to those who did not (adjusted odds ratio 8.99, 95% CI 2.81-30.56, p < .001). The rapid onset of action and ease of delivery without intravenous access offered by intranasal fentanyl make it a feasible initial parenteral analgesic in the treatment of children with SCD presenting with VOE in the acute-care setting. Further study is needed to determine potential causality of the association between intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department observed in this multicenter study.
32248201	Possible Propofol-Induced Priapism Following Cardiac Catheter Ablation in a Teenager.	BACKGROUND Priapism is rarely reported as a potential complication after the cardiac ablation procedure. We report the case of a teenager admitted for atrial flutter ablation who developed priapism following the procedure. CASE REPORT A 16-year-old male with episodic atrial flutter came to our hospital for an electrophysiological study and catheter ablation. During the procedure, he was given IV propofol for anesthesia and IV heparin for anticoagulation. After the procedure, nursing noted that he had an erection, which persisted for 5 h, with complaints of discomfort. There was no known history of sickle cell disease or trauma to the perineum, nor did he endorse any prior prolonged erections. On physical examination, he had a circumcised phallus with rigid and non-tender corpora cavernosa. He was given 5 mg terbutaline PO, without improvement. Three hours later, a second dose of terbutaline was given. In addition, a penis corporal venous blood gas was taken, and the result was consistent with an ischemic priapism. He had detumescence 1-2 min later. The total duration of his priapism was 8 h. There was no swelling, pain, or any sequelae after detumescence. CONCLUSIONS Although priapism rarely occurs as a complication following catheter ablation procedures due to propofol use, prolonged priapism can result in corporal fibrosis and cause future erectile dysfunction. Recognition and treatment of priapism in the postoperative period may be delayed due to a patient's hesitance to express concerns. To prevent future erectile dysfunction, signs of priapism should be included in routine postoperative evaluation in male patients.

29102975	Fatal delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction in a patient without previous transfusions but with an obstetric history of 13 pregnancies.	Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction is a rare, life-threatening complication of blood transfusion that has been typically described among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) due to alloimmunisation induced by their exposure to red blood cell antigens through recurrent transfusions. We report the case of a patient who suffered from fatal delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) occurring 1 week after blood transfusion. Indirect antiglobulin testing confirmed the presence of anti-Kell antibodies that were absent in the pretransfusion sample. The patient did not receive blood transfusions in the past, but her obstetric history was remarkable for 13 pregnancies. Although DHTR occurs more commonly among patients with SCD, this type of reaction can occur in any patient who is able to mount an immune response. We would to like to draw the attention of physicians to this rare and potentially lethal complication of blood transfusion, especially in grand multiparous women.
32506514	Liver transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: possible but challenging-a cohort study.	The liver is frequently affected in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but few reports have described liver transplantation (LT) in patients with SCD. We present a thorough analysis of the largest single-center series of LT in patients with SCD and the first systematic review. There were 21 patients with a median age of 37.6 years. LT was performed for acute liver failure related to the sickling process (57%) or electively for end-stage liver disease (43%). Prior to LT, 13 patients (62%) were in the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation (33%), vasopressor therapy (24%), renal replacement therapy (10%), or molecular adsorbent recirculating system therapy (19%). Post-LT morbidity and mortality were 95% and 33%, respectively. Patient survival at 1 and 5 years were 58.3% and 41.7%, respectively, in the urgent group and 88.9% and 77.8%, respectively, in the elective group. A total of 22 transplant patients with SCD are described in 20 articles in the literature. The 1- and 5-year patient survival rates for the 18 evaluable patients were 75% and 65%, respectively. LT improves survival in patients with SCD and acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease but is associated with high morbidity during the early postoperative course.
33349018	Hyperacute Recanalization Strategies and Childhood Stroke in the Evidence Age.	No controlled pharmacological studies are available in the field of pediatric stroke, except for sickle cell disease. Therefore, while pharmacological and mechanical recanalization treatments have repeatedly shown clinical benefit in adults with arterial ischemic stroke, pediatric strokologists still cannot base their therapeutic management (including hyperacute strategies) on high-level evidence. Once again, pediatricians face the same dichotomic choice: adapting adult procedures now versus waiting-for a long time-for the corresponding pediatric trials. One way out is building a compromise based on observational studies with large, longitudinal, comprehensive, real-life, and multisource dataset. Two recent high-quality observational studies have delivered promising conclusions on recanalization treatments in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke. TIPSTER (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke Extended Results) showed that the risk of severe intracranial hemorrhage after intravenous thrombolysis is low; the Save Childs Study reported encouraging data about pediatric thrombectomy. Beyond the conclusion of a satisfactory global safety profile, a thorough analysis of the methods, populations, results, and therapeutic complications of these studies helps us to refine indications/contraindications and highlights the safeguards we need to rely on when discussing thrombolysis and thrombectomy in children. In conclusion, pediatric strokologists should not refrain from using clot lysis/retrieval tools in selected children with arterial ischemic stroke. But the implementation of hyperacute care is only feasible if the right candidate is identified through the sharing of common adult/pediatric protocols and ward collaboration, formalized well before the child's arrival. These anticipated protocols should never undervalue contraindications from adult guidelines and must involve the necessary pediatric expertise when facing specific causes of stroke, such as focal cerebral arteriopathy of childhood.

36762634	Stroke in the young.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to review recent findings regarding stroke epidemiology, etiologies, and treatment in children and young adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Incidence in young adults is increasing, and incidence, recurrence, and survival is worse in patients with cryptogenic stroke and in developing countries. Careful consideration of patent foramen ovale closure is now recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. Thrombectomy has recently been extended to carefully selected children with acute ischemic stroke, and two recent publications strongly suggest that it can be beneficial for children. Sickle cell is also an important global contributor to stroke burden, but hydroxyurea can be a cost effective medication for stroke prevention in children. Recent advances in genetic testing and treatments may improve outcomes for patients with monogenic causes of stroke, such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, hemophilia, and Fabry's disease. SUMMARY: Stroke in children and young adults is a morbid disease responsible for enormous indirect societal costs and a high burden of years with disability per affected patient. Recent advances have improved access to care for children with large vessel occlusion and adults with rare causes of stroke. Future research may bring effective treatments for other monogenic causes of stroke as well as increasing access to hyperacute therapies for young stroke patients.
32841705	Efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for sickle cell disease: a review of clinical trials.	Sickle cell disease is prevalent in several parts of the world. Most hospitalizations of these patients are related to pain crisis episodes. Moreover, levels of hemoglobin are lower in sickle cell disease patients as compared with the general population. Complications related to sickle cell disease are managed with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, and opioids. Despite these therapies, patients with sickle cell disease experience multiple pain crisis episodes leading to hospitalizations and end-organ damage. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved three new drugs-L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab-for the prophylaxis and treatment of complications related to sickle cell disease. This review was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for the treatment of sickle cell disease. A comprehensive search was made on PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov to look for clinical trials reporting the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for sickle cell disease. Based on the results of clinical trials, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab were well tolerated by sickle cell disease patients. L-Glutamine and crizanlizumab reduced the number of sickle cell crisis episodes, while voxelotor improved the level of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease patients. These drugs were effective alone and in combination with hydroxyurea.
34101983	SNAP: Supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES: To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients <=22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.
38331925	Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

33955552	Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm.	The phase III Transfusion and Treatment of severe anaemia in African Children Trial (TRACT) found that conservative management of uncomplicated severe anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) 40-60 g/l] was safe, and that transfusion volume (20 vs. 30 ml/kg whole blood equivalent) for children with severe anaemia (Hb <60 g/l) had strong but opposing effects on mortality, depending on fever status (>37 5 C). In 2020 a stakeholder meeting of paediatric and blood transfusion groups from Africa reviewed the results and additional analyses. Among all 3196 children receiving an initial transfusion there was no evidence that nutritional status, presence of shock, malaria parasite burden or sickle cell disease status influenced outcomes or modified the interaction with fever status on volume required. Fever status at the time of ordering blood was a reliable determinant of volume required for optimal outcome. Elevated heart and respiratory rates normalised irrespective of transfusion volume and without diuretics. By consensus, a transfusion management algorithm was developed, incorporating three additional measurements of Hb post-admission, alongside clinical monitoring. The proposed algorithm should help clinicians safely implement findings from TRACT. Further research should assess its implementation in routine clinical practice.
37016392	Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for the chemoprevention of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia in eastern and southern Africa (CHEMCHA): a protocol for a multi-centre, two-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial.	BACKGROUND: An estimated 300,000 babies are born with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) annually. Affected children have chronic ill health and suffer premature death. Febrile illnesses such as malaria commonly precipitate acute crises in children with SCA. Thus, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is an important preventive strategy, but current regimes are either sub-optimally effective (e.g. monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) or difficult to adhere to (e.g. daily proguanil). We propose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as the agent with the most potential to be used across Africa. METHODS: This will be a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial of weekly single-day courses of DP compared to monthly single-day courses of SP in children with SCA. The study will be conducted in eastern (Uganda) and southern (Malawi) Africa using randomisation stratified by body weight and study centre. Participants will be randomised using an allocation of 1:1 to DP or SP. We will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and uptake and cost-effectiveness of malaria chemoprevention with weekly courses of DP vs monthly SP in 548 to 824 children with SCA followed up for 12-18 months. We will also assess toxicity from cumulative DP dosing and the development of resistance. Participant recruitment commenced on 30 April 2021; follow-up is ongoing. DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, findings will be used to inform regional health policy. This manuscript is prepared from protocol version 2.1 dated 1 January 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04844099 . Registered on 08 April 2021.
29222289	What is the role of screening for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children with sickle cell disease?	Patient case: An 18-year-old male patient with homozygous hemoglobin SS disease was evaluated for progressive dyspnea and elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) on echocardiography. The patient's case is described in detail in Lancet1 He had been treated with regular transfusions since childhood for stroke, had rare episodes of vaso-occlusive pain episodes, and did not take narcotic pain medications. He presented with progressive severe dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema. His laboratory tests were notable for a total hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL and hemoglobin S levels <30% but with 18% reticulocytes and elevated markers of hemolysis, such as high plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate amino transferase, and indirect bilirubin. The computed tomography scan of his chest in Figure 1A-B shows a large pulmonary artery, which has a greater diameter than his aorta, and a mosaic perfusion pattern, typical for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. His Doppler echocardiographic study (Figure 1C) showed an unusually high TRV of 5.93 m/s, consistent with a calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of >140 mm Hg (4 times the TRV squared = 4V2). Additional images in Figure 1D show a dilated right ventricle and right atrium with a compressed left ventricle. The patient's right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 147 mm Hg and diastolic pressure of 49 mm Hg; note that the normal values are ~25/10 mm Hg.
32470438	Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of deferiprone compared with deferasirox in paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies (DEEP-2): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies require lifelong iron chelation therapy with one of the three iron chelators (deferiprone, deferasirox, or deferoxamine). Deferasirox and deferiprone are the only two oral chelators used in adult patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies. To our knowledge, there are no randomised clinical trials comparing deferiprone, a less expensive iron chelator, with deferasirox in paediatric patients. We aimed to show the non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox. METHODS: DEEP-2 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised trial in paediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies. The study was done in 21 research hospitals and universities in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Tunisia, and the UK. Participants were receiving at least 150 mL/kg per year of red blood cells for the past 2 years at the time of enrolment, and were receiving deferoxamine (<100 mg/kg per day) or deferasirox (<40 mg/kg per day; deferasirox is not registered for use in children aged <2 years so only deferoxamine was being used in these patients). Any previous chelation treatment was permitted with a 7-day washout period. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered daily deferiprone (75-100 mg/kg per day) or daily deferasirox (20-40 mg/kg per day) administered as dispersible tablets, both with dose adjustment for 12 months, stratified by age (<10 years and >=10 years) and balanced by country. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on predefined success criteria for changes in serum ferritin concentration (all patients) and cardiac MRI T2-star (T2*; patients aged >10 years) to show non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox in the per-protocol population, defined as all randomly assigned patients who received the study drugs and had available data for both variables at baseline and after 1 year of treatment, without major protocol violations. Non-inferiority was based on the two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the proportion of patients with treatment success between the two groups and was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than -12 5%. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with EudraCT, 2012-000353-31, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01825512. FINDINGS: 435 patients were enrolled between March 17, 2014, and June 16, 2016, 393 of whom were randomly assigned to a treatment group (194 to the deferiprone group; 199 to the deferasirox group). 352 (90%) of 390 patients had beta-thalassaemia major, 27 (7%) had sickle cell disease, five (1%) had thalassodrepanocytosis, and six (2%) had other haemoglobinopathies. Median follow-up was 379 days (IQR 294-392) for deferiprone and 381 days (350-392) for deferasirox. Non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox was established (treatment success in 69 [55 2%] of 125 patients assigned deferiprone with primary composite efficacy endpoint data available at baseline and 1 year vs 80 [54 8%] of 146 assigned deferasirox, difference 0 4%; 95% CI -11 9 to 12 6). No significant difference between the groups was shown in the occurrence of serious and drug-related adverse events. Three (2%) cases of reversible agranulocytosis occurred in the 193 patients in the safety analysis in the deferiprone group and two (1%) cases of reversible renal and urinary disorders (one case of each) occurred in the 197 patients in the deferasirox group. Compliance was similar between treatment groups: 183 (95%) of 193 patients in the deferiprone group versus 192 (97%) of 197 patients in the deferisirox group. INTERPRETATION: In paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, deferiprone was effective and safe in inducing control of iron overload during 12 months of treatment. Considering the need for availability of more chelation treatments in paediatric populations, deferiprone offers a valuable treatment option for this age group.

29875973	Sickle cell trait and haemophilia: a rare association.	In this paper we analyze the combination of HbAS disease and haemophilia A must be exceedingly rare. Because of this rarity we report the case of two brothers with sickle cell trait and major haemophilia A. We conclude that it is about a post-circumcision bleeding due to major hemophilia A associated to sickle cell AS, this association was a systematic discovery.
37939876	Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.	Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.
33956057	Disease severity impacts plerixafor-mobilized stem cell collection in patients with sickle cell disease.	Recent studies suggest that plerixafor mobilization and apheresis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is safe and can allow collection of sufficient CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) collection for clinical gene therapy applications. However, the quantities of plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells vary between different SCD patients for unknown reasons. Twenty-three participants with SCD underwent plerixafor mobilization followed by apheresis, processing, and HSC enrichment under a phase 1 safety and efficacy study conducted at 2 institutions. Linear regression or Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the relationships between various hematologic and clinical parameters with total CD34+ cells/kg collected. Median CD34+ cells/kg after 2 or fewer mobilization and apheresis cycles was 4.0 x 106 (range, 1.5-12.0). Similar to what is observed generally, CD34+ yield correlated negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with baseline (P = .003) and preapheresis blood CD34+ cells/microL (P < .001), and baseline white blood cell (P = .01) and platelet counts (P = .03). Uniquely for SCD, CD34+ cell yields correlated positively with the number of days hydroxyurea was held (for up to 5 weeks, P = .01) and negatively with markers of disease severity, including hospitalization frequency within the preceding year (P = .01) and the number of medications taken for chronic pain (P = .002). Unique SCD-specific technical challenges in apheresis were also associated with reduced CD34+ cell collection efficiency and purification. Here, we describe factors that impact plerixafor mobilization success in patients with SCD, confirming known factors as described in other populations in addition to reporting previously unknown disease specific factors in patients with SCD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03226691.
37883315	Longer length peripheral catheters in sickle cell treatment: a more efficient and cost-effective care pathway.	Patients with sickle cell disease require frequent venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition. Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased pain on insertion, and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input and resulted in anxiety and pain on insertion for patients. In this article, the author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.
31505045	Systematic Review of l-glutamine for Prevention of Vaso-occlusive Pain Crisis in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	l-glutamine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sickle cell disease (SCD) in 2017. A vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) occurs in persons with SCD and is associated with acute pain episodes. This systematic review summarizes the evidence for l-glutamine in the prevention of VOC and associated pain in patients with SCD. Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched for records reporting on l-glutamine use in persons with SCD. Eligibility criteria identified primary reports of investigations conducted in humans who were administered l-glutamine, reported on outcomes related to VOC or associated pain, published in English, and were available as full text. All relevant efficacy, safety, participant demographic data, and study method characteristics were extracted and documented. Risk-of-bias assessments were conducted using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized studies. Three studies assessing the effect of exogenous l-glutamine administration in patients with SCD met eligibility criteria: one prospective nonrandomized controlled study and two prospective randomized controlled trials. Rate of VOC and related hospitalizations were reduced in patients receiving l-glutamine, although some conflicting results were noted between studies. l-glutamine was generally well tolerated. Limitations of one or more of the eligible studies included small sample size, nonblinding, and study groups that differed at baseline. l-glutamine has limited high-quality evidence supporting its use. Although l-glutamine is FDA approved for the prevention of frequent episodes of VOC pain, only one randomized controlled trial has strong evidence to support this indication. Based on the results of a systematic review, l-glutamine may be considered for patients unable to receive hydroxyurea or in addition to hydroxyurea for reduction in VOC and associated pain.
30667500	Association of Matched Sibling Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation With Transcranial Doppler Velocities in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia.	Importance: In children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), high transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities are associated with stroke risk, which is reduced by chronic transfusion. Whether matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (MSD-HSCT) can reduce velocities in patients with SCA is unknown. Objective: To determine the association of MSD-HSCT with TCD velocities as a surrogate for the occurrence of ischemic stroke in children with SCA. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nonrandomized controlled intervention study conducted at 9 French centers. Patients with SCA were enrolled between December 2010 and June 2013, with 3-year follow-up ending in January 2017. Children with SCA were eligible if younger than 15 years, required chronic transfusions for persistently elevated TCD velocities, and had at least 1 sibling without SCA from the same 2 parents. Families agreed to HLA antigen typing and transplantation if a matched sibling donor was identified or to standard care in the absence of a matched sibling donor. Exposures: MSD-HSCT (n = 32), compared with standard care (n = 35) (transfusions for >=1 year with potential switch to hydroxyurea thereafter), using propensity score matching. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the highest time-averaged mean of maximum velocities in 8 cerebral arteries, measured by TCD (TCD velocity) at 1 year. Twenty-five of 29 secondary outcomes were analyzed, including the highest TCD velocity at 3 years and normalization of velocities (<170 cm/s) and ferritin levels at 1 and 3 years. Results: Sixty-seven children with SCA (median age, 7.6 years; 35 girls [52%]) were enrolled (7 with stroke history). In the matched sample, highest TCD velocities at 1 year were significantly lower on average in the transplantation group (129.6 cm/s) vs the standard care group (170.4 cm/s; difference, -40.8 cm/s [95% CI, -62.9 to -18.6]; P < .001). Of the 25 analyzed secondary end points, 4 showed significant differences, including the highest TCD velocity at 3 years (112.4 cm/s in the transplantation group vs 156.7 cm/s in the standard care group; difference, -44.3 [95% CI, -71.9 to -21.1]; P = .001); normalization rate at 1 year (80.0% in the transplantation group vs 48.0% in the standard care group; difference, 32.0% [95% CI, 0.2% to 58.6%]; P = .045); and ferritin levels at 1 year (905 ng/mL in the transplantation group vs 2529 ng/mL in the standard care group; difference, -1624 [95% CI, -2370 to -879]; P < .001) and 3 years (382 ng/mL in the transplantation group vs 2170 ng/mL in the standard care group; difference, -1788 [95% CI, -2570 to -1006]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with SCA requiring chronic transfusion because of persistently elevated TCD velocities, MSD-HSCT was significantly associated with lower TCD velocities at 1 year compared with standard care. Further research is warranted to assess the effects of MSD-HSCT on clinical outcomes and over longer follow-up. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01340404.
36508693	Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) includes a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies affecting multiple organs including the eyes. Some people with SCD develop ocular manifestations. Vision-threatening complications are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is characterised by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) to prevent sight-threatening complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in SCD-related proliferative retinopathy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 4 July 2022. We also searched the following resources (26 June 2022): Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials; we extracted and analysed data, contacting trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (414 eyes of 339 children and adults) comparing the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with PSR. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single-centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two-centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow-up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low-certainty evidence). The two-centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow-up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low-certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow-up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow-up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow-up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow-up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow-up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P <= 0.5). The two-centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow-up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow-up 32 months); one centre (mean follow-up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low-certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low-certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long-term follow-up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low- or very low-certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient-important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence).  Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) . Patient-important outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness should be addressed.
28221265	Acute Liver Failure During Deferasirox Chelation: A Toxicity Worth Considering.	This case report details a unique case of acute, reversible liver failure in a 12-year-old male with sickle cell anemia on chronic transfusion protocol and deferasirox chelation. There is substantial literature documenting deferasirox-induced renal injury, including Fanconi syndrome, but less documentation of hepatic toxicity and few reports of hepatic failure. The case highlights the importance of close monitoring of ferritin, bilirubin, and transaminases for patients on deferasirox.

31742587	Beneficial effects of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle microvasculature in sickle cell disease patients.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy leading to 2 major clinical manifestations: severe chronic hemolytic anemia and iterative vaso-occlusive crises. SCD is also accompanied by profound muscle microvascular remodeling. The beneficial effects of endurance training on microvasculature are widely known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an endurance training program on microvasculature of skeletal muscle in SCD patients. A biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental exercise was performed before and after the training period. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets from 32 patients were obtained. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the nontraining (n = 17) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Training consisted of three 40-minute cycle ergometer exercise sessions per week for 8 weeks. Histological analysis highlighted microvascular benefits in the training SCD patients compared with nontraining patients, including increases in capillary density (P = .003), number of capillaries around a fiber (P = .015), and functional exchange surface (P < .0001). Conversely, no significant between-group difference was found in the morphology of capillaries. Indexes of physical ability also improved in the training patients. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise training program improved the muscle capillary network and partly reversed the microvascular defects commonly observed in skeletal muscle of SCD patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.
36115765	Under the hood: The molecular biology driving gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease.	Gene therapy will soon become the dominant modality for treating of sickle cell disease (SCD). Currently, three technologies are the most promising: expression of transgenic globin genes via a lentiviral vector, controlled mutation of the beta-globin control cluster by transgenic CRISPR-based ribonucleoprotein, and suppression of BCL11a mRNA by shRNA. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of each technology and how they correct the SCD pathology at the molecular level. We conclude by discussing potential directions future therapy may take.
35590440	A rapid evidence assessment of sickle cell disease educational interventions.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of educational interventions on the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) pain management in the UK. BACKGROUND: Variations and inadequate pain management due toHCPs' lack of knowledge and negative attitude is still an ongoing global concern for SCD patients despite availability of effective treatment and evidence-based guidelines. Several international studies have implemented interventions aimed at improving knowledge, attitude, and pain management. No review on the effectiveness of these interventions was found. Also, no previous intervention done in the UK was found from the thorough search of research databases. However, there are estimated 240,000 genetic carriers with about 12,500-15,000 estimated people living with SCD in the UK. DESIGN: Rapid Evidence Assessment of existing evidence. METHODS: A rapid evidence assessment was conducted between March 2021-January 2022 following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Included papers must have an educational intervention about SCD or related symptom management where the learners were HCPs. Excluded papers were those not published in English or before 2010. The following databases were searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed America and Europe, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Data quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) and analysed using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the final review. Overall, they reported improved outcomes in six main themes: knowledge, attitude, perception, adoption, satisfaction and efficiency. Five studies reported statistically significant improvement in at least one outcome, four studies reported positive improvement, and two studies reported no significant improvement in knowledge and attitude. These heterogeneous studies were implemented once, and all designs were prone to bias; this makes it difficult to state how effective interventions are for SCD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence of positive improvement in HCPs' knowledge and attitude is insufficient for generalisation and recommendation for adoption. However, we believe that implementing validated educational interventions remains essential for effective acute SCD pain management and patient-centred care. Further research is needed to find a suitable educational intervention that can be replicated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Quality SCD education, timely crisis management and reduced patient stigma are crucial in reducing the risk of rapid clinical decompensation to avoid developing life-threatening complications. Understanding SCD can also support the building of therapeutic relationships between the patient and practitioner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review was not registered.
31495699	Effect of donor type and conditioning regimen intensity on allogeneic transplantation outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease: a retrospective multicentre, cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Donors other than matched siblings and low-intensity conditioning regimens are increasingly used in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We aimed to compare the relative risk of donor type and conditioning regimen intensity on the transplantation outcomes of in patients with sickle cell disease. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we collected data from 90 US centres reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Eligible patients were younger than 50 years, had genetically confirmed sickle cell disease (Hb SS) or sickle beta thalassemia (Hb Sbeta), and underwent allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation between Jan 15, 2008, and Dec 28, 2017. We considered transplants from donor-recipient pairs matched at the allele-level (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1), including HLA-matched sibling donors, haploidentical related donors, matched unrelated donors, or mismatched unrelated donors. The main outcome was event-free survival. The effect of donor type, conditioning regimen intensity (myeloablative, non-myeloablative, and reduced-intensity regimens), age (<=12 or 13-49 years), sex, performance score, comorbidity index, recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, graft type (bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood), and transplantation period (2008-12 and 2013-17) on outcomes was studied using Cox regression models. FINDINGS: Of 996 patients with sickle cell disease and who underwent transplantation in 2008-17, 910 (91%) were included (558 [61%] patients had HLA-matched sibling donors, 137 [15%] haploidentical related donors, 111 [12%] matched unrelated donors, and 104 [11%] mismatched unrelated donors). The median follow-up was 36 months (IQR 18-60) after transplantation from HLA-matched siblings, 25 months (12-48) after transplantation from haploidentical related donors, 37 months (23-60) after transplantation from HLA-matched unrelated donors, and 47 months (24-72) after transplantation from mismatched unrelated donors. Event-free survival was worse in recipients aged 13 years or older than in those younger than 13 years (hazard ratio 1 74, 95% CI 1 24-2 45; p=0 0014) and in those who received a transplant from haploidentical related donors (5 30, 3 17-8 86; p<0 0001), matched unrelated donors (3 71, 2 39-5 75; p<0 0001), and mismatched unrelated donors (4 34, 2 58-7 32; p<0 0001) than in patients who received a transplant from matched siblings. There was no significant difference in event-free survival between recipients of transplants from non-sibling donors: haploidentical related donors (1 43, 0 81-2 50; p=0 21) or mismatched unrelated donors (1 17, 0 67-2 05; p=0 58) versus HLA-matched unrelated donors, or mismatched unrelated donors versus haploidentical related donors (1 22, 0 65-2 27; p=0 98). Event-free survival was also worse in patients conditioned with reduced-intensity regimens (1 97, 1 15-3 36; p=0 013) than in those conditioned with non-myeloablative regimens, but did not differ between those who received myeloablative compared with non-myeloablative regimens (1 57, 0 95-2 61; p=0 079). Interpretation Our data suggest that event-free survival is improved in patients with sickle cell disease who receive an allogenic transplantation at age 12 years or younger and those with an HLA-matched sibling donor. For patients without a matched sibling available for transplantation, our data do not favour one alternative donor type over another in this setting.

29115052	Dose Selection Based on Modeling and Simulation for Rivipansel in Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to 11 Years With Sickle Cell Disease.	This modeling and simulation exercise aimed to provide dosing recommendations for rivipansel phase III studies in children aged 6-11 years with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pharmacokinetic data from 109 patients aged 12-51 years who received rivipansel (2-40 mg/kg) in previous studies (three phase I and one phase II) were integrated to build a three-compartmental simulation model. Renal clearance simulations across the age range accounted for renal function development and postulated hyperfiltration in SCD. Simulated demographic distributions for the pediatric SCD population were used to predict concentration-time profiles from three dosing regimens, which were then compared against efficacious average steady-state concentrations observed in phase II. A dosing regimen comprising a 40-mg/kg loading dose followed by a 20-mg/kg maintenance dose every 12 hours was selected, as it will likely provide an efficacious concentration range. Its validity will be confirmed in the ongoing phase III study.
34474658	Co-existing sickle cell anaemia and inflammatory bowel disease: case report and review of the literature.	Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a chronic haemolytic anaemia associated with vaso-occlusive painful crises which may affect several systems including the gastro-intestinal system, resulting in abdominal pain. The concurrence of inflammatory bowel disease and haemoglobinopathy is rare. No previously reported concurrent cases of both SCA and ulcerative colitis (UC) in sub-Saharan Africa were found in the literature. A 16-year-old girl with concurrent SCA and UC is presented. She was admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan with a 1-year history of recurrent peri-umbilical pain and bloody stools. These symptoms were mainly attributed to SCA at the referring hospital, and she was managed for chronic tropical diarrhoea without a remarkable clinical response. This case illustrates the concurrent presentation of SCA and ulcerative colitis which led to the missed and delayed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.
34537158	Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Special Statement: Beyond the scalpel: in utero fetal gene therapy and curative medicine.	With the recent advances in gene editing with systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, precise genome editing in utero is on the horizon. Sickle cell disease is an excellent candidate for in utero fetal gene therapy, because the disease is monogenic, causes irreversible harm, and has life-limiting morbidity. Gene therapy has recently been proven to be effective in an adolescent patient. Several hurdles still impede the progress for fetal gene therapy in humans, including an incomplete understanding of the fetal immune system, unclear maternal immune responses to in utero gene therapy, risks of off-target effects from gene editing, gestational age constraints, and ethical questions surrounding fetal genetic intervention. However, none of these barriers appears insurmountable, and the journey to in utero gene therapy for sickle cell disease and other conditions should be well underway.
37743224	Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).	BACKGROUND: RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients with SCD. To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles. RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.
33554579	Optimal timing to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy: first vs. second trimester.	OBJECTIVES: Although current guidelines advice to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy, little is known about the best moment of testing. The goal of this study is to analyze the optimal timing (first vs. second trimester) to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis, comparing patients that were screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first vs. second trimester was performed. The main question was to compare the rate of positive urinary culture in both trimesters. Study included patients all followed a prenatal consultation at the University Hospital of Brussels between 2012 and 2017. Other outcomes considered were the nature of identified germs, treatments, possible risk and confounding factors (age, BMI, gravidity-parity-abortus [GPA], type of conception, ethnicity, education, prior urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes, hypertension, prior preterm delivery and sickle cell disease) and complications (UTI, preterm delivery, preterm rupture of the membranes and chorio-amnionitis). RESULTS: A total of 2,005 consecutive files were reviewed, 655 concerned patients screened during the first trimester group and 1,350 in the second trimester group. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was present in only 71 cases (3.54%), 23 in the first trimester group (3.50%) and 48 in the second trimester group (3.55%). Escherichia coli was the most frequently identified germ (37 cases (1.8%), 14 in the first trimester group and 23 in the second trimester group). Our logistic regression analysis shows no statistical difference according to the moment the urinary culture was done for the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (E. coli or others), for its association with hospitalization for pyelonephritis, preterm contractions, preterm pre-labor rupture of the membranes (PPROM) and/or preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: If recommendations remain to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once during pregnancy, this study indicates that the moment of testing (first vs. second trimester) has no clinical impact on obstetrical outcomes.
38693059	Survival of transfused red blood cells from a donor with alpha-thalassemia trait in a recipient with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Post-transfusion survival of donor red blood cells (RBCs) is important for effective chronic transfusion therapy in conditions including sickle cell disease (SCD). Biotin labeling RBCs allows direct in vivo measurement of multiple donor RBC units simultaneously post-transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In an observational trial of patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusion therapy, aliquots of RBCs from one transfusion episode were biotin-labeled and infused along with the unlabeled RBC units. Serial blood samples were obtained to measure RBC survival. Donor units were tested for RBC indices, hemoglobin fractionation, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. For microcytic donor RBCs (MCV < 70 fL), HBA1 and HBA2 genetic testing was performed on whole blood. RESULTS: We present one recipient, a pediatric patient with SCD and splenectomy who received two RBC units with aliquots from each unit labeled at distinct biotin densities (2 and 18 mug/mL biotin). One donor unit was identified to have microcytosis (MCV 68.5 fL after biotinylation); whole blood sample obtained at a subsequent donation showed 2-gene deletion alpha-thalassemia trait (alpha-3.7kb/alpha-3.7kb) and normal serum ferritin. G6PD activity was >60% of normal mean for both. The RBCs with alpha-thalassemia RBC had accelerated clearance and increased surface phosphatidylserine post-transfusion, as compared with the normocytic RBC (half life 65 vs. 86 days, respectively). DISCUSSION: Post-transfusion RBC survival may be lower for units from donors with alpha-thalassemia trait, although the impact of thalassemia trait donors on transfusion efficacy requires further study.
37074146	Epidemiological and clinical features, therapeutic strategies and outcomes in patients with hyperhaemolysis: A systematic review.	Hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS), a severe form of delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction most commonly described in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), involves destruction of both donor and recipient red blood cells (RBCs). As the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology have yet to be definitively elucidated, recognition can be challenging. We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE to identify all cases of post-transfusion hyperhaemolysis and characterized the epidemiological, clinical and immunohaematological characteristics and treatments of HHS. We identified 51 patients (33 females and 18 males), including 31 patients with SCD (HbSS, HbSC and HbS/beta-thalassaemia). The median haemoglobin nadir (3.9 g/dL) occurred a median of 10 days post-transfusion. 32.6% and 45.7% of patients had a negative indirect anti-globulin test and a negative direct anti-globulin test, respectively. The most common therapies included corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. 66.0% of patients received >=1 supportive transfusion, which was associated with a longer median hospital stay/time to recovery (23 days vs. 15 days; p = 0.015) compared to no supportive transfusion. These findings illustrate that HHS that often results in marked anaemia 10 days post-transfusion is not restricted to patients with haemoglobinopathies, and additional transfused RBCs may be associated with a longer time-to-recovery.
37277324	A multimodal pain protocol for treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: Implementation and evaluation.	OBJECTIVES: Pain management during a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a major challenge and strongly depends on opioids. We developed a multimodality pain protocol for rapid, opioid-sparing pain treatment of VOC and evaluated its feasibility. METHODS: Patients were included for evaluation if they were >=18 years, diagnosed with SCD and visited the emergency department (ED) because of VOC between July 2018 and December 2020. Primary evaluation outcome was the feasibility of multimodal pain analgesia (i.e., the use of at least two analgesics with different underlying mechanisms of action). RESULTS: A total of 131 SCD patients visited the ED because of VOC with a total of 550 ED presentations, of which 377 were eventually hospitalised. A total of 508 (92.4%) ED presentations and 374 (99.2%) hospital admissions received multimodal pain treatment. Time to first administration of an opioid was median [IQR] 34.0 [21.0-62.0] minutes. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a pain protocol using multimodal analgesia for VOC in patients with SCD appeared to be feasible and facilitated rapid administration of opioids. Controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of multimodal analgesia on pain and should focus on patient reported outcome measures.
31264793	Successful treatment with eculizumab for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to underlying transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy in patients transplanted for sickle cell disease.	Preexisting endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury sustained during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) increases risk for endothelial injury-related complications such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We report two patients with SCD who developed PRES following allogeneic HCT. In both patients, PRES-related symptoms resolved only after a diagnosis of TA-TMA was established and eculizumab therapy was initiated. Renal manifestations at diagnosis included non-nephrotic range proteinuria and hypertension. This report highlights the importance of screening PRES-affected SCD HCT recipients for TA-TMA as usual treatment strategies may be inadequate.

31589171	The cause and pathogenesis of hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle-cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review aims to summarize the epidemiology, cause, pathophysiology, and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle-cell disease (SCD). RECENT FINDINGS: Patients undergoing occasional, isolated transfusions have been shown to have a higher risk of developing this condition. Despite the identification of well known risk factors, including alloimmunization, the pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unclear, as very severe forms with hyperhemolysis may develop in the absence of detectable antibodies, or with antibodies that are not considered to be clinically significant. Complement plays a crucial role in this reaction, particularly in cases of intravascular hemolysis. Complement triggers the reaction, but it also amplifies the inflammatory response and aggravates tissue damage. Free heme and hemoglobin are released and interact with complement, causing tissue damage. SUMMARY: Hemolytic transfusion reactions are the most feared complications of blood transfusion in patients with SCD. This reaction is underdiagnosed because it mimics a vaso-occlusive crisis. Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens is known to be a major trigger of this reaction, but abnormal complement activation and the underlying condition in patients with chronic hemolysis, may amplify the reaction. There is an urgent need to develop evidence-based approaches for preventing and treating this reaction.
36775201	Multicenter Long-Term Follow-Up of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation with Omidubicel: A Pooled Analysis of Five Prospective Clinical Trials.	Omidubicel is an umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ex vivo-expanded cellular therapy product that has demonstrated faster engraftment and fewer infections compared with unmanipulated UCB in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although the early benefits of omidubicel have been established, long-term outcomes remain unknown. We report on a planned pooled analysis of 5 multicenter clinical trials including 105 patients with hematologic malignancies or sickle cell hemoglobinopathy who underwent omidubicel transplantation at 26 academic transplantation centers worldwide. With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, .3 to 122 months), the 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival were 62.5% and 54.0%, respectively. With up to 10 years of follow-up, omidubicel showed durable trilineage hematopoiesis. Serial quantitative assessments of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD116+CD56+, and CD123+ immune subsets revealed median counts remaining within normal ranges through up to 8 years of follow-up. Secondary graft failure occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the first year, with no late cases reported. One case of donor-derived myeloid neoplasm was reported at 40 months post-transplantation. This was also observed in a control arm patient who received only unmanipulated UCB. Overall, omidubicel demonstrated stable trilineage hematopoiesis, immune competence, and graft durability in extended follow-up.
29403023	Allogenic peripheral stem cell transplantation from HLA-matched related donors for adult sickle cell disease: remarkable outcomes from a single-center trial.	Adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are highly susceptible to stem cell transplant complications, including drug toxicity, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and graft rejection due to SCD-related tissue damage, endothelial activation, and inflammation. The scarcity of compatible stem cells for transplantation further limits treatment options, with only 43 cases of adult allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donors reported in the international registry for the period 1986-2013. Herein we report remarkable outcomes in a cohort of adult SCD patients who underwent allo-PSCT using a fludarabine (Flu), busulfan (Bu), and anti-T-cell lymphocyte globulin (ATG)-based conditioning regimen in combination with very low dose total body irradiation (TBI), followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) and sirolimus as GVHD prophylaxis. We performed a single-center, retrospective study consisting of 20 consecutive patients (mean age 33.4 years) who underwent allo-PSCT from HLA-matched related donors with a conditioning regimen of Flu 150/Bu 3.2/Cy 29/ATG 30 (Fresenius)/TBI 200 between September 2013 and September 2017. Data were validated by an independent data audit group of the affiliated JACIE-accredited transplantation center. All patients experienced a sustained donor cell engraftment. Full donor chimerism (total cell) occurred within 180 days in all patients. Mean duration of follow-up was 13.8 months (range: 0.3-50 months), with 12 (60%) patients completing 12 months. No non-relapse mortality or graft rejection occurred. Successful treatment was achieved without the presence of graft loss, grade III-IV acute GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD, or other major complications. Allo-PSCT in combination with Flu 150/Bu 3.2/Cy 29/ATG 30(Fresenius)/TBI 200- Cy/Sirolimus therapy yielded encouraging outcomes with no mortality and low incidence of GVHD. Further controlled studies will be necessary to compare transplant protocols and long-term outcomes.
29804934	Pediatric red cell and platelet transfusions.	The aim of pediatric transfusions should be based on the concept of avoiding unnecessary transfusions without jeopardizing the patient safety and providing correct blood components when there are well founded indications to transfuse. Despite considerable efforts from transfusion services to increase transfusion safety, transfusions are still associated with preventable and unpreventable adverse effects that may, in the worst case, have severe and fatal consequences. Transfusions to pediatric patients constitute a small proportion of all transfusions but have higher incidence of adverse events compared to adults. Pediatric transfusions consist of intrauterine transfusions, top-up transfusions to neonates and young children, exchange transfusions in the management of hemolytic disease of newborn (HDN), in addition to sickle cell crisis, chronic transfusion therapy in thalassemia patients, massive transfusion in trauma, HLA- and HPA-compatible platelets in immunized patients and neonates with fetal neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). Packed red cells (PRCs) and platelet (PLT) concentrates are the most utilized blood components and will be reviewed here.
27998188	Can the surgical tourniquet be used in patients with sickle cell disease or trait? A review of the literature.	INTRODUCTION: In patients with sickle cell disease, circulatory stasis, acidosis, and hypoxemia induce red cell deoxygenation and consequent sickling. Tourniquets are an important adjunct in limb surgery to obtain a bloodless field. Many local and systemic effects, due to the inflation and deflation of the tourniquet, can develop. These effects may have severe consequences if comorbidities are present. The use of a tourniquet in sickle cell patients is controversial because it may provoke vaso-occlusive complications. Areas covered:We reviewed the literature to detect reports of the use of tourniquet in sickle cell disease or sickle trait. We found only three case reports and five case series, three of which controlled, none randomized, on the complications of tourniquet. Expert commentary:From what we could find in the literature and contrary to what is suggested by most guidelines it appears that complications are rare. However, caution must be applied and the risk/benefit ratio carefully considered.
28110486	Spectra Optia  for Automated Red Blood Cell Exchange in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A NICE Medical Technology Guidance.	The Spectra Optia  automated apheresis system, indicated for red blood cell exchange in people with sickle cell disease, underwent evaluation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which uses its Medical Technologies Advisory Committee to make recommendations. The company (Terumo Medical Corporation) produced a submission making a case for adoption of its technology, which was critiqued by the Newcastle and York external assessment centre. Thirty retrospective observational studies were identified in their clinical submission. The external assessment centre considered these were of low methodological and reporting quality. Most were single-armed studies, with only six studies providing comparative data. The available data showed that, compared with manual red blood cell exchange, Spectra Optia reduces the frequency of exchange procedures as well as their duration, but increases the requirement for donor blood. However, other clinical and patient benefits were equivocal because of an absence of robust clinical evidence. The company provided a de novo model to support the economic proposition of the technology, and reported that in most scenarios Spectra Optia was cost saving, primarily through reduced requirement of chelation therapy to manage iron overload. The external assessment centre considered that although the cost-saving potential of Spectra Optia was plausible, the model and its clinical inputs were not sufficiently robust to demonstrate this. However, taking the evidence together with expert and patient advice, the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee considered Spectra Optia was likely to save costs, provide important patient benefits, and reduce inequality, and gave the technology a positive recommendation in Medical Technology Guidance 28.
31407926	Splenic Infarct on Exposure to Extreme High Altitude in Individuals with Sickle Trait: A Single-Center Experience.	"Background: Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a common genetic abnormality in the so-called ""sickle belts"" in India. Splenic infarction often brings to medical attention an underlying SCT, when appropriately looked for. The hypoxic environment of an extreme high-altitude area (HAA) is conducive for developing a splenic infarct in an SCT individual not a native of these areas. Aims: We studied retrospectively 27 cases who presented with a splenic infarction during the last 4 years. Results: Twenty-five patients (92.5%) were diagnosed to have SCT, and 85% patients had developed splenic infarct on exposure to very HAAs. Clinically, splenomegaly was seen in 33% of patients with splenic infarct at presentation. The mean hemoglobin S was 36.92% in SCT individuals. A thrombus in the splenoportal axis was demonstrated in 22.2% of cases. Splenic rupture was a rare event, seen in only 3.5% of patients. Splenectomy was not required in any of the cases. Splenic abscess was not seen, and antibiotics were not required in any of the cases. We discuss the profile and management of these patients and review the literature on splenic infarction in HAA. Conclusion: SCT is commonly overlooked cause of splenic infarction and conservative management is effective in most of the cases. Splenectomy is required only in the rarest of rare cases. The profile and management of these patients and a review of the literature on splenic infarction in HAA has been discussed."
32501930	The Heterogeneity of Pediatric Knee Infections: A Retrospective Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal infection is a major cause of morbidity in the pediatric population. Despite the canonical teaching that an irritable joint and signs of infection likely represent an infected joint space, recent evidence in the pediatric hip has demonstrated that alternative diagnoses are equally or more likely and that combinations of pathologies are common. The knee is the second most commonly infected joint in children, yet there remains a paucity of available data regarding the epidemiology and workup of the infected pediatric knee. The authors hypothesize that there is heterogeneity of pathologies, including combinations of pathologies, that presents as a potentially infected knee in a child. The authors aim to show the utility of magnetic resonance imaging and epidemiologic and laboratory markers in the workup of these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of all consults made to the pediatric orthopaedic surgery team at a single tertiary care center from September 2009 through December 2015 regarding a concern for potential knee infection was performed. Excluded from the study were patients with penetrating trauma, postoperative infection, open fracture, no C-reactive protein (CRP) within 24 hours of admission, sickle cell disease, an immunocompromised state, or chronic osteomyelitis. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were analyzed in this study. There was marked variability in pathologies. Patients with isolated osteomyelitis or osteomyelitis+septic arthritis were older, had an increased admission CRP, were more likely to be infected with Staphylococcus aureus, required an increased duration of antibiotics, and had an increased incidence of musculoskeletal complications than patients with isolated septic arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: When considering a child with an irritable knee, a heterogeneity of potential underlying pathologies and combinations of pathologies are possible. Importantly, the age of the patient and CRP can guide a clinician when considering further workup. Older patients with a higher admission CRP value warrant an immediate magnetic resonance imaging, as they are likely to have osteomyelitis, which was associated with worse outcomes when compared with patients with isolated septic arthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective research study.
28953858	Gene therapy: Erasing sickle-cell disease.

33331032	A case of hyperhaemolysis syndrome in a pregnant Chinese woman with beta-thalassemia during perinatal transfusion.	OBJECTIVES: To report a case of hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) that occurred during perinatal blood transfusion in a pregnant Chinese woman with beta-thalassemia to deepen the understanding of HHS and the risk of transfusion therapy for patients with thalassemia. BACKGROUND: Most HHS cases occur in people with sickle cell disease. So far, no cases of HHS have been reported in the Chinese population. Here, we report a pregnant Chinese women with beta-thalassemia experiencing HHS. METHODS: The patient received ABO- and RhD-matched red blood cell transfusion from six blood donors in four perinatal transfusions. Haemoglobinuria and lower haemoglobin levels compared to those before transfusion were observed after each transfusion, and the lactate dehydrogenase was consistently elevated. The blood samples were collected at different time points during the hospitalisation for direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antibody screening test and acid elution test. The antigens of six blood donors were identified, and the cross-matching tests were repeated using the blood sample of the patient with specific irregular antibodies after the last transfusion. RESULTS: The DAT of the patient was negative for anti-IgG and positive (1+) for anti-C3d, and no red blood cell antibodies were detected in the eluent before, between and after transfusions. Before and between transfusions, blood samples were negative for red blood cell irregular antibodies, whereas IgM anti-P1 and IgG anti-Jka were detected in blood samples the next day after the last transfusion. In the six donors, two were negative for P1 and Jka , one was positive for P1 and negative for Jka , and three were negative for P1 and positive for Jka . The tentative cross-matching tests using the indirect antiglobulin method in saline showed that only agglutination occurred in the blood samples of the patient collected after last transfusion and the three Jka -positive blood donors. DISCUSSION: The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results suggested that HHS occurred in this patient with beta-thalassemia after each transfusion. Clinicians should be aware that HHS can occur with compatible blood transfusion.
31413089	Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide and approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways 'downstream' to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. To date, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition of intracellular HbS polymerization, inhibition of oxidant stress and inflammation, and perturbation of the activation of the endothelium and other blood components (e.g. platelets, white blood cells, coagulation proteins) involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. In this article, we present a crash-course review of disease-modifying approaches (minus hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) for patients with sickle cell disease currently, or recently, tested in clinical trials in the era following approval of hydroxyurea.
28340843	Acquired Acrodermatitis Enteropathica Syndrome in a Kidney Transplant Receipt: A Case Report.	Acrodermatitis enteropathica syndrome (AE) is a clinical entity that results in severe zinc deficiency. It can be genetic or acquired. Acquired AE has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease, malabsorption syndrome, sickle cell anemia, and chronic renal failure. We present a kidney transplant recipient with skin rash and watery diarrhea. The patient had low serum zinc levels, which quickly resolved after zinc supplementation. Skin biopsy showed cytoplasmic pallor and vacuolization and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes within the superficial epidermis, which may have led to confluent necrosis of keratinocytes. Large amounts of keratinosome-derived lamellae were found in the intercellular spaces in the keratinized area, probably related to disturbance of keratinosome metabolism due to zinc deficiency.
32202248	Alternative donor: alphass/CD19 T-cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder; despite significant improvements in supportive care, SCD continues to cause substantial morbidity, mortality, and reduced life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative therapy for SCD, which is offered as a standard of care for patients with a matched sibling donor (MSD). Donor availability is limited to a minority of patients. Thus, alphabeta/CD3-depleted haploidentical HSCT, as an efficient means for depletion of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)-mediating T cells, can be offered as an alternative curative therapy, particularly for nonmalignant diseases such as SCD. Out of 38 patients with advanced stage SCD, 25 were transplanted with CD3/CD19- or T-cell receptor alphabeta/CD19 T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cell grafts (T-haplo-HSCT group), whereas 13 transplanted from MSD (MSD group); both groups received an almost identical conditioning regimen. Engraftment was achieved in all. However, in the T-haplo-HSCT group, three patients succumbed to an uncontrolled cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, a macrophage activation syndrome, and a major blood group incompatibility with a late graft failure and multiorgan failure. The overall survival was 88% and 100% in T-haplo-HSCT and MSD groups, respectively. None of our patients developed a Glucksberg Grade III-IV acute GvHD. Four patients (16%) in the T-haplo-HSCT group and two patients (15%) in the MSD group developed a steroid-sensitive, mild-to-moderate chronic GvHD that resolved within 18 months posttransplant. These results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of T-haplo-HSCT in advanced stage SCD in children and adults, thus offering a curative alternative to majority of patients.
34889404	Management of hemolytic transfusion reactions.	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) in patients with sickle cell disease are underappreciated and potentially fatal. Patients with DHTRs typically have symptoms of pain or dark urine days to weeks following a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In instances of DHTRs with hyperhemolysis, the patient's hemoglobin (Hgb) may be significantly lower than it was pretransfusion, and the Hgb A may drop by more than 50%. In most cases, at least 1 RBC alloantibody and sometimes multiple RBC alloantibodies can be identified during the DHTR, with those antibodies presumably having fallen below the level of detection at the time of the implicated transfusion. However, in up to one-third of cases, no new RBC alloantibodies can be identified posttransfusion. Complement is increasingly being appreciated to play a role in DHTRs and hyperhemolysis, not only due to classic pathway activation (with complement fixed antibody bound to RBCs) but also due to alternative pathway activation (resulting in part from plasma free heme). As such, anti-C5 inhibition has recently been reported to be effective at mitigating hemolysis in the setting of some severe DHTRs. Transfusion avoidance during DHTRs is recommended if possible, with long-term transfusion support advice being less clear; for example, a history of a severe DHTR may lead to questions regarding the safety of transfusions prior to curative therapies such as stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. A better understanding of antibody-positive and antibody-negative DHTRs, including patient- or disease-specific risk factors, is necessary to improve transfusion safety.
28159390	Sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is a common and life-threatening haematological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Abnormal sickle-shaped erythrocytes disrupt blood flow in small vessels, and this vaso-occlusion leads to distal tissue ischaemia and inflammation, with symptoms defining the acute painful sickle-cell crisis. Repeated sickling and ongoing haemolytic anaemia, even when subclinical, lead to parenchymal injury and chronic organ damage, causing substantial morbidity and early mortality. Currently available treatments are limited to transfusions and hydroxycarbamide, although stem cell transplantation might be a potentially curative therapy. Several new therapeutic options are in development, including gene therapy and gene editing. Recent advances include systematic universal screening for stroke risk, improved management of iron overload using oral chelators and non-invasive MRI measurements, and point-of-care diagnostic devices. Controversies include the role of haemolysis in sickle cell disease pathophysiology, optimal management of pregnancy, and strategies to prevent cerebrovascular disease.
37417197	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an oral formulation of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by an inherited structural abnormality of adult hemoglobin causing polymerization. Fetal hemoglobin interferes with polymerization but is epigenetically silenced by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in adult erythropoiesis. Decitabine depletes DNMT1 and increases fetal and total hemoglobin in SCD patients, but is rapidly catabolized by cytidine deaminase (CDA) in vivo. Tetrahydrouridine (THU) inhibits CDA, safeguarding decitabine. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three oral combination formulations of THU and decitabine, with different coatings producing different delays in decitabine release, were investigated in healthy participants. RESULTS: Tetrahydrouridine and decitabine were rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation after a single combination oral dose, with relative bioavailability of decitabine >=74% in fasted males compared with separate oral administration of THU followed by decitabine 1 h later. THU and decitabine Cmax and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve were higher in females versus males, and fasted versus fed states. Despite sex and food effect on pharmacokinetics, the pharmacodynamic effect of DNMT1 downregulation was comparable in males and females and fasted and fed states. Treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Combination oral formulations of THU with decitabine produced pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suitable for oral DNMT1-targeted therapy.
36400544	The Evolving Landscape of Drug Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.	Although sickle cell disease can be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy and gene editing, these treatments remain unavailable to most patients. As understanding of the disease pathophysiology increases, progress is being made in developing drug therapies. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes. Clinical and surrogate endpoints, other than vaso-occlusive crisis, are increasingly being considered in the evaluation of novel drugs.

37996648	Motixafortide: First Approval.	Motixafortide (APHEXDATM) is a selective C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) inhibitor being developed by BioLineRx under licence from Biokine Therapeutics for the mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the treatment of various cancers. On 11 September 2023, motixafortide was approved in the USA for use in combination with filgrastim [granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)] to mobilize HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Motixafortide has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the EU and the USA, and for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in the USA. Clinical development is ongoing for the mobilization of CD34+ HSCs for gene therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of motixafortide leading to this first approval.

33050763	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies.	Hemoglobinopathies are the most common single-gene diseases and are estimated to affect millions of people worldwide. Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are the most prevalent diseases of this group. Today, despite the decreasing number of newborns diagnosed with a hemoglobinopathy, it remains an important health problem for many countries. Although regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, advanced iron chelation, and supportive therapy alternatives have improved life expectancy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies to prevent irreversible organ damage. Modern transplantation approaches and careful posttransplantation follow-up of patients have improved survival outcomes, and HSCT has now been performed in several patients with hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Considering current experiences, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended in cases of beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) in the presence of a matched family or unrelated donor, without secondary organ damage due to transfusion. In patients with sickle cell anemia, transplantation indications include transfusion dependence and cases of secondary organ damage. Recently, gene therapy as a possible treatment option has yielded promising results, though it is not in routine clinical use at its current stage.
30300449	Deferasirox in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia or sickle cell anemia: A large cohort real-life experience from Turkey (REACH-THEM).	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox therapy in a large observational cohort of children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell anemia (SCA) in Turkey. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study including TDT and SCA patients aged 2-18 years with iron overload (>=100 mL/kg of pRBC or a serum ferritin [SF] level >1000 mug/L) receiving deferasirox. Patients were followed for up to 3 years according to standard practice. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were evaluated (415 [94.5%] TDT, 143 [32.6%] between 2 and 6 years). Serum ferritin levels consistently and significantly decreased across 3 years of deferasirox therapy from a median of 1775.5 to 1250.5 mug/L (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin decreases were noted in TDT (1804.9 to 1241 mug/L), SCA (1655.5 to 1260 mug/L), and across age groups of 2-6 years (1971.5 to 1499 mug/L), 7-12 years (1688.5 to 1159.8 mug/L), and 13-18 years (1496.5 to 1107 mug/L). Serum ferritin decreases were also noted for all deferasirox dose groups but only significant in patients with doses >=30 mg/kg/d (n = 120, -579.6 median reduction, P < 0.001). Only 9 (2%) patients had adverse events suspected to be related to deferasirox. Serum creatinine slightly increased but remained within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Deferasirox has long-term efficacy and safety in children with TDT and SCA, although higher doses (>=30 mg/kg/d) may be required to achieve iron balance.

Fetal hemoglobin induction is a key point in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD). We report the case of a kidney transplant recipient with SCD who was treated with everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. At 10 months after initiating therapy, the patient's fetal hemoglobin level was dramatically increased (from 4.8% to 15%) and there was excellent tolerance to treatment.
30196969	Risks associated with fertility preservation for women with sickle cell anemia.	OBJECTIVE: To highlight the risk of complications among women with sickle cell anemia (SCA) receiving fertility preservation treatment (FPT) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). DESIGN: Single-center case series. SETTING: Academic fertility center. PATIENT(S): Women aged 15-32 years with SCA undergoing FPT before HSCT. INTERVENTION(S): Retrospective, systematic review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): FPT modality, SCA complications during FPT. RESULT(S): Over an 8-year period (2009-2017), seven women with SCA ages 15-32 years (mean 28.5 years) underwent FPT with embryo cryopreservation (n = 1), oocyte cryopreservation (n = 4), and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (n = 2). The five women subjects who underwent oocyte or embryo cryopreservation were treated with an antagonist controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocol and individualized gonadotropin dosing. The trigger medications included leuprolide acetate (n = 2), and human chorionic gonadotropin (n = 3). Most patients (n = 5) received a disease-modifying therapy for SCA (hydroxyurea or chronic transfusions) before FPT. Three patients experienced periprocedural SCA complications that included life-threatening respiratory failure, painful crisis requiring interruption of a stimulation cycle, and severe postharvest painful crisis. CONCLUSION(S): Women with SCA may choose to undergo diverse FPT strategies before HSCT and are at risk for serious SCA-related complications. Evidence-based strategies to mitigate SCA-related morbidity and to optimize fertility preservation outcomes are needed.
35302009	Long-term Survival after Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease Compared to the United States Population.	Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life threatening complications most of which occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In the current era with interest in gene therapy and gene editing we felt it timely to report on sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least 2-year after transplantation, not previously reported. Our objectives were to (1) report the conditional survival rates of patients who were alive for 2 or more years after transplantation (2) identify risk factors for death beyond 2 years after transplantation and (3) compare all-cause mortality risks to those of an age-, sex- and race-matched general population in the United States. By limiting to 2-year survivors, we exclude deaths that occur as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified records of 1149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source and 950 patients were eligible (https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). All analyses were performed in this secure cloud environment using the available statistical software package(s). The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing results from an earlier publication. Conditional survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that had survived a given length (x) of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with mortality beyond 2 years after transplantation. The standardized relative mortality risk (SMR) or the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths, was used to quantify all-cause mortality risk after transplantation and compared to age, race and sex-matched general population. Person-years at risk were calculated from an anchor date (i.e., 2-, 5- and 7-years) after transplantation until date of death or last date known alive. The expected number of deaths was calculated using age, race and sex-specific US mortality rates. The median follow up was 5 years (range 2-20) and 300 (32%) patients were observed for more than 7 years. Among those who lived for at least 7 years after transplantation the 12-year probability of survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%). Compared to an age-, race- and sex-matched US population, the risk for late death after transplantation was higher as late as 7 years after transplantation (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2; P= .020) but the risk receded over time. Risk factors for late death included age at transplant and donor type. For every 10-year increment in patient age, an older patient was 1.75 times more likely to die than a younger patient (P= .0004). Compared to HLA-matched siblings the use of other donors was associated with higher risk for late death (HR 3.49; P= .003). Graft failure (beyond 2-years after transplantation) was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) and graft failure was higher after transplantation of grafts from donors who were not HLA-matched siblings (HR 2.59, P< .0001). Long-term survival after transplantation is excellent and support this treatment as a cure for sickle cell disease. The expected risk for death recedes over time but the risk for late death is not negligible.
34227124	Early initiation of hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) using individualised, pharmacokinetics-guided dosing can produce sustained and nearly pancellular expression of fetal haemoglobin in children with sickle cell anaemia.	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) is an effective treatment for sickle cell anaemia (SCA), but clinical responses depend primarily upon the degree of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) induction and the heterogeneity of HbF expression across erythrocytes. The number and characteristics of HbF-containing cells (F-cells) are not assessed by traditional HbF measurements. Conventional hydroxyurea dosing (e.g. fixed doses or low starting doses with stepwise escalation) produces a moderate heterocellular HbF induction, but haemolysis and clinical complications continue. Robust, pancellular HbF induction is needed to minimise or fully inhibit polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin. We treated children with hydroxyurea using an individualised, pharmacokinetics-guided regimen starting at predicted maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We observed sustained HbF induction (mean >30%) for up to 6 years, which was not dependent on genetic determinants of HbF expression. Nearly 70% of patients had >=80% F-cells (near-pancellular), and almost half had >=90% F-cells (pancellular). The mean HbF/F-cell content was ~12 pg. Earlier age of initiation and better medication adherence were associated with high F-cell responses. In summary, early initiation of hydroxyurea using pharmacokinetics-guided starting doses at predicted MTD can achieve sustained near-pancellular or pancellular HbF expression and should be considered an achievable goal for children with SCA treated with hydroxyurea at optimal doses. Clinical trial registration number: NCT02286154 (clinicaltrials.gov).
34043152	Sickle cell disease related chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: challenging clinical scenario.	Sickle cell disease (SCD), a haemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic haemolysis with acute exacerbations and vascular occlusion episodes, may be complicated by pulmonary hypertension. The latter may be caused by chronic thromboembolic disease of pulmonary artery branches and its management is not well-defined. Herein, we present a case of SCD complicated by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension of subsegmental pulmonary artery branches successfully treated with endothelin receptor antagonists, orally administered prostacyclin analogs and balloon pulmonary angioplasty. This challenging case highlights the need for clinical awareness of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as a specific and potentially curable form of pulmonary hypertension complicating SCD course that may necessitate combined pharmacologic and interventional management.

33075179	Randomized control trial of oral arginine therapy for children with sickle cell anemia hospitalized for pain in Nigeria.	Low arginine bioavailability is associated with vaso-occlusive painful crisis (VOC) severity in sickle cell anemia (SCA) and predicts need for pediatric hospitalization. Intravenous arginine therapy has opioid-sparing effects and was found to significantly decrease pain scores in children hospitalized with SCA-VOC in a phase-two randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT). Efficacy of oral arginine is unknown. Our objective was to determine the safety and efficacy of oral arginine therapy in Nigerian children with SCA. A double-blind RCT of oral L-arginine-hydrochloride (100 mg/kg TID) was conducted in children with SCA-VOC, aged 5-17 years, hospitalized at two Nigerian sites. The primary outcome measure was analgesic usage, quantified by difference in the mean Analgesic Medication Quantification Scale (MQS). Secondary outcomes included daily pain scores, time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Sixty-eight children (age 5-17 years, mean 10.6 +- 0.4 years; 56% male), were randomized to receive L-arginine (35 patients) or placebo (33 patients). The mean total MQS for the arginine group was 73.4 (95% CI, 62.4-84.3) vs 120.0 (96.7-143.3) for placebo (P < .001). The mean rate of decline in worst pain scores was faster in the arginine arm vs placebo (1.50 [1.23-1.77] vs 1.09 [0.94-1.24] point/d, P = .009). Children receiving arginine had a shorter time-to-crisis-resolution (P = .02), shorter hospital-stay (P = .002) and experienced no serious adverse event. Pain control was more rapid, total analgesic requirement was significantly reduced, and most notably, time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay were shorter in children with SCA-VOC receiving arginine vs placebo. Given the established safety and low cost, oral arginine is a promising adjuvant therapy for SCA-VOC management.
37147250	The implementation of automated red blood cell exchange (erythrocytapheresis) as a treatment modality in sickle cell disease patients: Single center experience.	BACKGROUND: Improvements of health infrastructure, preventive care and clinical management is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE: This prospective, investigator-initiated non-randomized open-label intervention, single centre study describes the implementation of the automated erythrocytapheresis in low-middle income country as a treatment modality for SCD patients to improve the standard of care and highlights its benefits and challenges. METHODOLOGY: Eligible patients with SCD who had overt stroke, abnormal/conditional transcranial doppler (TCD), or other indications were subjected to regular automated erythrocytapheresis program. RESULTS: From 18th Dec 2017 till 17th Dec 2022, 21 subjects were enrolled; seventeen (80.9 %) were Egyptian and four (19.1 %) were non-Egyptian (three Sudanese and one Nigerian). Totalling 133 sessions had been performed mainly in working hours with fluctuating frequency per month. All sessions maintained isovolumic status and were performed using central venous access. The target HbS concentration was set from the start; the mean final FCR % fraction was 51, most of the session (n = 78, 58.7 %) were able to achieve target FCR. The majority of session pass smoothly with no adverse event (n = 81, 60.9 %), except for certain challenges as shortage of the required blood (n = 38), hypotension (n = 2), hypocalcaemia (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Automated erythrocytapheresis is safe and effective modality for management of patients with sickle cell disease.
29193101	Case series supporting heme detoxification via therapeutic plasma exchange in acute multiorgan failure syndrome resistant to red blood cell exchange in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Depletion of haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) with increase in free hemoglobin and heme are important etiologies of vaso-occlusive complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). This study is the first to show an association between clinical improvement in SCD and repletion of Hp and Hx by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) using plasma replacement. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) units derived from consecutive whole blood donations were thawed at 37 C after 10 months of storage; Hp and Hx concentrations immediately postthaw and after 5 days of refrigerated storage were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All SCD patients presenting to a single institution over a 2-year period with acute multiorgan failure syndrome resistant to red blood cell exchange (RCE) were treated with TPE with FFP replacement; concentrations of Hp, Hx, and heme were evaluated before and after TPE by ELISA. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of Hp and Hx decreased approximately 20% (p <= 0.002) after 5 days of refrigerated storage. Significant mean fold increases after TPE of 10 for Hp (p < 0.005) and seven for Hx (p < 0.003) and a 30% mean decrease in heme concentrations (p = 0.07) were noted in association with clinical improvement (three patients), whereas minimal increases in Hp and Hx were associated with continued clinical deterioration in one patient. CONCLUSION: Fresh-frozen plasma rather than thawed plasma is optimal for Hp and Hx replacement. Patient data are consistent with Hp and Hx increases via TPE limiting clinical toxicity of worsened hemolysis associated with severe vaso-occlusive complications refractory to RCE in SCD.
38775255	Antioxidant supplementation for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of an abnormal haemoglobin molecule called haemoglobin S (HbS). When subjected to oxidative stress from low oxygen concentrations, HbS molecules form rigid polymers, giving the red cell the typical sickle shape. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve outcomes in other diseases associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, it is important to review and synthesize the available evidence on the effect of antioxidants on the clinical outcomes of people with SCD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antioxidant supplementation for improving health outcomes in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 15 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing antioxidant supplementation to placebo, other antioxidants, or different doses of antioxidants, in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and reported according to Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 1609 participants in 26 studies, with 17 comparisons. We rated 13 studies as having a high risk of bias overall, and 13 studies as having an unclear risk of bias overall due to study limitations. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence. Only eight studies reported on our important outcomes at six months. Vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) versus placebo Based on evidence from one study in 83 participants, vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 2.18), the severity of pain (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.37), or adverse effects (AE), of which the most common were headache, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, and epigastric pain (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00). Vitamin C plus vitamin E may increase the risk of SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome: RR 2.66, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.13; 1 study, 83 participants), and increase haemoglobin level (median (interquartile range) 90 (81 to 96) g/L versus 93.5 (84 to 105) g/L) (1 study, 83 participants) compared to placebo. However, the evidence for all the above effects is very uncertain. The study did not report on quality of life (QoL) of participants and their caregivers, nor on frequency of hospitalization. Zinc versus placebo Zinc may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis at six months (rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.29; 1 study, 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether zinc is better than placebo at improving sickle cell-related complications (complete healing of leg ulcers at six months: RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 6.72; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (g/dL) (MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.26; 1 study, 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not report on severity of pain, QoL, AE, and frequency of hospitalization. N-acetylcysteine versus placebo N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 1200 mg may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis in SCD, reported as pain days (rate ratio 0.99 days, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.84; 1 study, 96 participants; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study (96 participants) suggests NAC (1200 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD 0.17, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.87). Compared to placebo, NAC (1200 mg) may not be better at improving physical QoL (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.41) and mental QoL (MD 2.00, 95% CI -1.45 to 5.45; very low-certainty evidence), reducing the risk of adverse effects (gastrointestinal complaints, pruritus, or rash) (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; low-certainty evidence), reducing the frequency of hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; low-certainty evidence), and sickle cell-related complications (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.48; very low-certainty evidence), or increasing haemoglobin level (MD -0.18 g/dL, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; low-certainty evidence). L-arginine versus placebo L-arginine may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (monthly pain) (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; 1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD -1.41, 95% CI -1.65 to -1.18; 2 studies, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence). One participant allocated to L-arginine developed hives during infusion of L-arginine, another experienced acute clinical deterioration, and a participant in the placebo group had clinically relevant increases in liver function enzymes. The evidence is very uncertain whether L-arginine is better at reducing the mean number of days in hospital compared to placebo (MD -0.85 days, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.17; 2 studies, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also, L-arginine may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.4 g/dL, 95% CI -0.50 to 1.3; 2 studies, 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study in this comparison reported on QoL and sickle cell-related complications. Omega-3 versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence shows no evidence of a difference in the risk of adverse effects of omega-3 compared to placebo (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.48; 1 study, 67 participants). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that omega-3 may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.36 g/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.93; 1 study, 67 participants). The study did not report on frequency of crisis, severity of pain, QoL, frequency of hospitalization, and sickle cell-related complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was inconsistent evidence on all outcomes to draw conclusions on the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidants. However, L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain at six months, and zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level. We are uncertain whether other antioxidants are beneficial for SCD. Larger studies conducted on each comparison would reduce the current uncertainties.
28573314	Reduced toxicity, myeloablative HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers the possibility of cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Unfortunately, the probability of finding an HLA-matched donor for SCD patients is low. HSCT from HLA-haploidentical donors using reduced intensity conditioning, unmanipulated bone marrow and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCy) has resulted in negligible toxicity but high rates of graft rejection. We hypothesized that combining ptCy with a myeloablative reduced toxicity conditioning including serotherapy to increase immune ablation would allow for better engraftment. In a pilot approach, we treated three patients with SCD (5, 8, and 20 years old) lacking a matched donor. All patients had severe disease-related complications despite standard treatment. They received unmanipulated bone marrow from parental HLA-haploidentical donors. Conditioning consisted of alemtuzumab 0.2 mg/kg/day on days -9 and -8, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -7 to -3, treosulfan 14 g/m2/day on days -7 to -5, thiotepa 2 x 5 mg/kg/day on day -4, and cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg/day on days -3 and -2. GVHD prophylaxis was performed using cyclophosphamide 2 x 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4 and mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus from day +5. After a follow-up of 11, 14, and 30 months, all three patients are alive and well, off immunosuppression, and without symptoms of SCD. One patient experienced mild skin GVHD grade I, none showed chronic GVHD. Asymptomatic CMV reactivation was seen in two patients. HLA-haploidentical HSCT can extend the donor pool for patients with SCD. Whether intensification of the conditioning regimen and intensive immunosuppression leads to improvement in engraftment rates while still allowing a favorable toxicity profile deserves further investigation.
34607344	Economic evaluation of regular transfusions for cerebral infarct recurrence in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Trial.	In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published evidence-based guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Although the guidelines were based on National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trials, no cost-effectiveness analysis was completed for children with SCA and silent cerebral infarcts. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing regular blood transfusion vs standard care using SIT (Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion) Trial participants. This analysis included a modified societal perspective with direct costs (hospitalization, emergency department visit, transfusion, outpatient care, and iron chelation) and indirect costs (special education). Direct medical costs were estimated from hospitalizations from SIT hospitals and unlinked aggregated hospital and outpatient costs from SIT sites by using the Pediatric Health Information System. Indirect costs were estimated from published literature. Effectiveness was prevention of infarct recurrence. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using a 3-year time horizon (mean SIT Trial participant follow-up) compared transfusion vs standard care. A total of 196 participants received transfusions (n = 90) or standard care (n = 106), with a mean age of 10.0 years. Annual hospitalization costs were reduced by 54% for transfusions vs standard care ($4929 vs $10 802), but transfusion group outpatient costs added $22 454 to $137 022 per year. Special education cost savings were $2634 over 3 years for every infarct prevented. Transfusion therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $22 025 per infarct prevented. Children with preexisting silent cerebral infarcts receiving blood transfusions had lower hospitalization costs but higher outpatient costs, primarily associated with the oral iron chelator deferasirox. Regular blood transfusion therapy is cost-effective for infarct recurrence in children with SCA. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00072761.
34851438	First report of successful treatment for hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha by hemopoietic stem cell transplantation.	HBB gene mutations lead to many kinds of diseases, of which, except for the two most common diseases of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, rare kinds of hemolytic anemia, such as hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha, are rarely reported, no ideal treatment in clinic. A child suffered from chronic recurrent hemolytic attacks and the related genes of hereditary hemolytic anemia were detected on her. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was conducted in the treatment of the patient. The patient was diagnosed as hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha and achieved complete recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For Bristol-Alesha, without characteristic clinical manifestation and specific biochemical examination, diagnosis is dependent on the gene mutation detection and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective and curable method.

The use of blood transfusions to improve anemia resulting from sickle cell disease (SCD) is often limited by alloimmunization, which occurs due to exposure to incompatible antigen present on donor red blood cells (RBCs). This complication occasionally manifests as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) that cause hemolysis of the recipient's own RBCs and can lead to fatal anemia. In this case study, we report a patient with SCD who experienced a DHTR following chronic transfusion and was successfully treated with voxelotor, an orally administered sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization inhibitor for the treatment of SCD. Laboratory tests following admission indicated pan-reactivity in antigens, and a rare donor registry was used to locate acceptable units. The patient experienced the DHTR 3 days after admission, which limited laboratory tests due to profound hemolysis. Alternative treatments were limited, and phenotypically matched units were incompatible, so voxelotor was selected as a last-resort treatment. Following initiation of voxelotor 1500 mg, the patient's hemoglobin levels returned to baseline (6 g/dl) within 10 days, with clinical improvements. This report provides evidence regarding the use of voxelotor in the treatment of profound anemia where other treatments could be unsafe or unavailable.
30403414	How we evaluate red blood cell compatibility and transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.	Multiple hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation options for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently under investigation. Patients with SCD have a high rate of alloimmunization to red blood cell antigens, often complicating transfusion support. Transfusion reactions, including acute and delayed hemolytic reactions, have been observed despite immunosuppressive regimens. Allogeneic donor transplants have been shown to carry a risk of prolonged reticulocytopenia and acute hemolysis with severe anemia in nonmyeloablative regimens. We discuss our experience providing transfusion support to patients with SCD undergoing HPC transplantation, propose an outline for a complete pretransplantation evaluation, and discuss donor/recipient compatibility issues and their implications.
36748667	Successful therapeutic plasma exchange for a patient with sickle cell disease and fat embolism syndrome after a failure of a response to red cell exchange transfusion.	BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare complication, which was reported mostly with milder forms of heterozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). It may present in a catastrophic way with multi-organ failure, particularly involving the pulmonary and neurological systems. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed; and the standard recommended treatment is red cell exchange (RCE) transfusion, which has sub-optimal results, such as debilitating long-term neurological complications. Recently, few reports suggested that the addition of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) might further improve the outcome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman with homozygote SCD was admitted with bony pains and vaso-occlusive crises. However, her course evolved to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, decreased level of consciousness, skin rash, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and a picture consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. MRI of the brain showed scattered multi-focal ischemic foci and cytotoxic edema. The patient received RCE on the third day after admission without improvement. On the seventh day, TPE was instituted (2 L/day of fresh frozen plasma for 5 days), following which she regained her consciousness and showed an improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. On follow up, she had gradual full neurological recovery and resolution of the MRI findings within a few months. CONCLUSION: FES remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, with significant morbidity and mortality. Success in the management of this reported case with the addition of TPE to RCE supports the notion that TPE may be a potentially helpful modality that deserves further research.
30926306	Prevention of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.	Post-transfusion hemolysis is the most frequent immune reaction to transfusion in sickle cell disease. Its frequency is underestimated due to its biological and clinical characteristics. It results principally from the high incidence of alloimmunization in these patients, but no antibodies are detectable in 30% of cases. Prevention is based on the prevention of alloimmunization through the use of matched RBCs for highly immunogenic blood groups, taking into account the patient's transfusion history, particularly in patients undergoing occasional transfusion, which is associated with a higher risk of DHTR development than chronic transfusion. In addition to the use of matched RBCs, the prevention of alloimmunization through immunotherapy should be considered.
33958740	Stable to improved cardiac and pulmonary function in children with high-risk sickle cell disease following haploidentical stem cell transplantation.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of progressive, chronic pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction. In this prospective multicenter Phase II trial of myeloimmunoablative conditioning followed by haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with high-risk SCD, 19 patients, 2.0-21.0 years of age, were enrolled with one or more of the following: history of (1) overt stroke; (2) silent stroke; (3) elevated transcranial Doppler velocity; (4) multiple vaso-occlusive crises; and/or (5) two or more acute chest syndromes and received haploidentical transplants from 18 parental donors. Cardiac and pulmonary centralized cores were established. Pulmonary function results were expressed as percent of the median of healthy reference cohorts, matched for age, sex, height and race. At 2 years, pulmonary functions including forced expiratory volume (FEV), FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were stable to improved compared to baseline values. Importantly, specific airway conductance was significantly improved at 2 years (p < 0.004). Left ventricular systolic function (fractional shortening) and tricuspid regurgitant velocity were stable at 2 years. These results demonstrate that haploidentical stem cell transplantation can stabilize or improve cardiopulmonary function in patients with SCD.
33399868	A Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction Caused by an Unexpected Leb Antibody.	A Black male patient aged 21 years with a history of sickle cell disease and HIV was admitted to the hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis. A transfusion reaction was called after the patient developed a fever (39.5 C), tachycardia, chills, and hematuria after receiving 300 mL of red blood cells. A posttransfusion specimen was submitted to the Immunohematology Reference Laboratory for investigation. Antibody identification revealed an anti-Leb as the probable cause of the immediate acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Lewis antibodies are considered clinically insignificant. This case shows the importance of considering cold antibodies, including Lewis antibodies, as a possible cause of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.
37158403	Impact of prenatal corticosteroid therapy on sickle cell disease in pregnant women.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety of prenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies of women with sickle cell disease. METHODS: A multicenter observational study of patients with sickle cell disease, comparing vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring hospital care between pregnancies with versus without prenatal corticosteroids. RESULTS: In 40 pregnancies exposed to prenatal corticosteroids, compared with 370 unexposed pregnancies, VOC were not more frequent (62.5% vs 57.9%, P = 0.578) but they were more severe, with more intensive care hospitalizations (25.0% vs 12.9%, P = 0.039), emergency transfusions (44.7% vs 22.7%, P = 0.006), and acute chest syndromes (22.5% vs 8.9%, P = 0.010). These differences persisted after adjustment for severity and type of sickle cell syndrome (for intensive care admission adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-6.79, P = 0.031 and for acute chest syndrome aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.57-14.4, P = 0.008). VOC occurred on average 1.2 days following steroid administration. When comparing 36 patients receiving corticosteroids for fetal maturation with 58 patients who were hospitalized for obstetrical complications before 34 weeks of pregnancy but that did not receive corticosteroids, VOC incidence was not significantly higher (41.7% vs 31.5%, P = 0.323). CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to study the impact of prenatal corticosteroids on sickle cell disease. They were associated with more severe VOC, suggesting that steroids should be avoided in these women.
30597771	PF-04447943, a Phosphodiesterase 9A Inhibitor, in Stable Sickle Cell Disease Patients: A Phase Ib Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study.	This phase Ib study randomized patients with stable sickle cell disease (SCD) aged 18-65 years to twice-daily PF-04447943 (a phosphodiesterase 9A inhibitor; 5 or 25 mg) or placebo, with/without hydroxyurea coadministration, for up to 29 days. Blood samples were collected at baseline and various posttreatment time points for assessments of PF-04447943 pharmacokinetics (PKs)/pharmacodynamics (PDs). Change from baseline in potential SCD-related biomarkers was evaluated. Of 30 patients, 15 received hydroxyurea and 28 completed the study. PF-04447943, with/without hydroxyurea, was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Plasma PF-04447943 exposure was dose proportional. Twice-daily PF-04447943 25 mg significantly reduced the number and size of circulating monocyte-platelet and neutrophil-platelet aggregates and levels of circulating soluble E-selectin at day 29 vs. baseline (adjusted P < 0.15). PF-04447943 demonstrated PK/PD effects suggestive of inhibiting pathways that may contribute to vaso-occlusion. This study also provides guidance regarding biomarkers for future SCD studies.

28686127	Effectiveness of surgical revascularization for stroke prevention in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome.	OBJECTIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) in combination with moyamoya syndrome (MMS) represents a rare complication of SCD, with potentially devastating neurological outcomes. The effectiveness of surgical revascularization in this patient population is currently unclear. The authors' aim was to determine the effectiveness of surgical intervention in their series of SCD-MMS patients by comparing stroke recurrence in those undergoing revascularization and those undergoing conservative transfusion therapy. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients with MMS who were seen at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution between 1990 and 2013. Pediatric patients (age < 18 years) with confirmed diagnoses of SCD and MMS were included. Intracranial stroke occurrence during the follow-up period was compared between surgically and conservatively managed patients. RESULTS A total of 15 pediatric SCD-MMS patients (28 affected hemispheres) were included in this study, and all were African American. Seven patients (12 hemispheres) were treated with indirect surgical revascularization. The average age at MMS diagnosis was 9.0 +- 4.0 years, and 9 patients (60.0%) were female. Fourteen patients (93.3%) had strokes before diagnosis of MMS, with an average age at first stroke of 6.6 +- 3.9 years. During an average follow-up period of 11.6 years, 4 patients in the conservative treatment group experienced strokes in 5 hemispheres, whereas no patient undergoing the revascularization procedure had any strokes at follow-up (p = 0.029). Three patients experienced immediate postoperative transient ischemic attacks, but all recovered without subsequent strokes. CONCLUSIONS Indirect revascularization is suggested as a safe and effective alternative to the best medical therapy alone in patients with SCD-MMS. High-risk patients managed on a regimen of chronic transfusion should be considered for indirect revascularization to maximize the effect of stroke prevention.
30939227	Psychological therapies (remotely delivered) for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents.	BACKGROUND: This is the first update of a review published in 2015, Issue 1. Chronic pain is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes, such as increased severity of pain, reduced function, and low mood. Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. To address barriers to treatment access, such as distance and cost of treatment, technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies remotely. Therapies delivered remotely, such as via the Internet, computer-based programmes, and smartphone applications, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting list, treatment as usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) from inception to May 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remotely-delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries, reference sections, and citations of included studies for potential trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via technology in comparison to an active, treatment as usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and up to 30% face-to-face interaction. Interventions had to be delivered primarily via technology to be included, and we excluded interventions delivered via telephone. We included studies that delivered interventions to children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with a chronic pain condition or where chronic pain was a primary symptom of their condition (e.g. juvenile arthritis). We included studies that reported 10 or more participants in each comparator arm, at each extraction point. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We combined all psychological therapies in the analyses. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. We extracted pain severity/intensity, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events as primary outcomes, and satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between three and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed risk of bias and all outcomes for quality using the GRADE assessment. MAIN RESULTS: We found 10 studies with 697 participants (an additional 4 studies with 326 participants since the previous review) that delivered treatment remotely; four studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one included children with sickle cell disease, one included children with irritable bowel syndrome, and three studies included children with different chronic pain conditions (i.e. headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain). The average age of children receiving treatment was 13.17 years.We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk. However, we judged performance and attrition biases to be mostly unclear. Out of the 16 planned analyses, we were able to conduct 13 meta-analyses. We downgraded outcomes for imprecision, indirectness of evidence, inconsistency of results, or because the analysis only included one study.Headache conditionsFor headache pain conditions, we found headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 3.01); P < 0.001, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 5.36, 7 studies, 379 participants; very low-quality evidence). No effect was found at follow-up (very low-quality evidence). There were no effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.13; P = 0.28, 5 studies, 440 participants) or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence). Similarly, no effect was found for the outcomes of depression (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.23, P = 0.69, 4 studies, 422 participants) or anxiety (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.12; P = 0.45, 3 studies, 380 participants) at post-treatment, or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence).Mixed chronic pain conditionsWe did not find any beneficial effects of psychological therapies for reducing pain intensity post-treatment for mixed chronic pain conditions (SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.95 to 0.16; P = 0.10, 5 studies, 501 participants) or at follow-up. There were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.18; P = 0.24, 3 studies, 363 participants) and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analysis could be run. We found no beneficial effects for the outcomes of depression (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.26; P = 0.73, 2 studies, 317 participants) and anxiety (SMD 0.53, 95% CI -0.63 to 1.68; P = 0.37, 2 studies, 370 participants) post-treatment, however, we are cautious of our findings as we could only include two studies in the analyses. We could not conduct analyses at follow-up. We judged the evidence for all outcomes to be very low quality.All conditionsAcross all chronic pain conditions, six studies reported minor adverse events which were not attributed to the psychological therapies. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively and was overall positive. However, we judged both these outcomes as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are currently a small number of trials investigating psychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet. We are cautious in our interpretations of analyses. We found one beneficial effect of therapies to reduce headache severity post-treatment. For the remaining outcomes there was either no beneficial effect at post-treatment or follow-up, or lack of evidence to determine an effect. Overall, participant satisfaction with treatment was positive. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the estimate. Further studies are needed to increase our confidence in this potentially promising field.
28884840	Hydroxycarbamide in children with sickle cell anaemia after first-dose vs. chronic therapy: pharmacokinetics and predictive models for drug exposure.	AIMS: The purposes of this work were to: (1) compare pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for hydroxycarbamide in children receiving their first dose (HCnew ) vs. those receiving chronic therapy (HCchronic ), (2) assess the external validity of a published PK dosing strategy, and (3) explore the accuracy of dosing strategies based on a limited number of HC measurements. METHODS: Utilizing data from two prospective, multicenter trials of hydroxycarbamide (Pharmacokinetics of Liquid Hydroxyurea in Pediatric Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia; NCT01506544 and Single-Dose (SD) and Steady-State (SS) Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxyurea in Children and Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease), plasma drug concentration vs. time profiles were evaluated with a model independent approach in the HCnew and HCchronic groups. Various predictive scenarios were analysed to evaluate whether systemic exposure with hydroxycarbamide could be accurately predicted. RESULTS: Absorption of hydroxycarbamide was rapid, variable and dose independent. Dose-normalized peak plasma concentrations and drug exposure (AUC) were higher, and weight-normalized apparent oral clearance was lower in the HCnew group. We assessed a PK-guided dosing strategy along with other predictive scenarios and found that inclusion of plasma samples only slightly improved the accuracy of AUC predictions when compared to a population-based method. CONCLUSIONS: Children naive to hydroxycarbamide exhibit a different PK profile compared to children receiving chronic therapy. Accuracy of population-based dosing is sufficient to target AUCs in individual patients. Further clearance/bioavailability studies are needed to address the factors responsible for variability in the disposition of hydroxycarbamide.
29921991	Sickle Cell Hemoglobin C Disease Patient Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with Complete Exchange Blood Transfusion during Cardiopulmonary Bypass.	"Sickle cell disorders are associated with increased risk of sickling and vaso-occlusive complications when undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Monitoring of certain parameters such as venous and arterial oxygen content, hematocrit, acid base homeostasis, and body temperature are required for a superior outcome. Furthermore, perioperative exchange transfusion has a positive effect on the outcome of surgery and on the survival of patients undergoing heart surgery. Avoiding intraoperative hypoxia and hypothermia, and minimizing hemoglobin S (HbS) and hemoglobin C (HbC) levels with exchange transfusion make bypass surgery relatively safe with enhanced outcomes in these cases. The exact HbS level for conducting cardiac surgery with CPB is not known, however, a HbS level <30% is considered safe for conducting CPB. By using a ""discard"" cardiotomy reservoir and priming the oxygenator reservoir with donor blood, we were able to reduce the intraoperative circulating HbS and HbC levels to less than 15% and sequester the plasma and clotting factors from the discarded blood using intraoperative plasmapheresis."
29222304	Targeting novel mechanisms of pain in sickle cell disease.	"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from intense pain that can start during infancy and increase in severity throughout life, leading to hospitalization and poor quality of life. A unique feature of SCD is vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) characterized by episodic, recurrent, and unpredictable episodes of acute pain. Microvascular obstruction during a VOC leads to impaired oxygen supply to the periphery and ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which may perpetuate a noxious microenvironment leading to pain. In addition to episodic acute pain, patients with SCD also report chronic pain. Current treatment of moderate to severe pain in SCD is mostly reliant upon opioids; however, long-term use of opioids is associated with multiple side effects. This review presents up-to-date developments in our understanding of the pathobiology of pain in SCD. To help focus future research efforts, major gaps in knowledge are identified regarding how sickle pathobiology evokes pain, pathways specific to chronic and acute sickle pain, perception-based targets of ""top-down"" mechanisms originating from the brain and neuromodulation, and how pain affects the sickle microenvironment and pathophysiology. This review also describes mechanism-based targets that may help develop novel therapeutic and/or preventive strategies to ameliorate pain in SCD."

34551184	A systematic review of cases of West African crystalline maculopathy.	AIM: West African crystalline maculopathy (WACM) is, reportedly, a rare condition whose aetiology remains unclear. This study aims to describe the epidemiology, summarizing the identified risk factors and clinical characteristics of cases of WACM, with the goal of highlighting presentation patterns and the clinical course of the condition. METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, OMIM and Google scholar search of all articles written in English, and non-English language articles with abstract translated to English on WACM was carried out. Only full case reports and series were included. Data reviewed included epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, management and prognosis of WACM. Information on the location of the study was also extracted. RESULTS: Ten studies - seven case reports and three case series - comprising of 30 patients were included. The patients were from West, Central and North-east Africa, with all the studies carried out in North America and Europe. The majority of the patients (76.7%) had diabetes mellitus, 80% had a vascular retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion) and 50% had macular oedema. There was no report of associated visual impairment or retinal degeneration. Clinical improvement in the number of crystals was documented in two cases with retinal laser photocoagulation for associated vascular retinopathies. Clinical observation was employed by most clinicians. CONCLUSION: West African crystalline retinopathy is a seemingly innocuous condition affecting black or African people, who were also born in Africa. The majority of the patients have a vascular retinopathy. Longitudinal studies, particularly in Africa, may be required to elucidate the aetiology, as well as the long-term prognosis, of the crystals.
31460979	Current and emerging treatments for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders affecting the hemoglobin, shortening the lifespan of erythrocytes, and causing them to take on a distinctive sickled shape that can lead to vaso-occlusion. Current treatment aims to reduce morbidity and mortality through hydroxyurea, erythrocyte transfusion, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This article reviews the disease process, typical presentations, complications, and acute and chronic treatment options.

35472468	Pediatric Vulvovaginal Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study and Literature Review.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess genital symptomatology, characterize the findings of genital examination, and describe the incidence and treatment of vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (vvGvHD) in girls and adolescents after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Metropolitan-area children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Female allogeneic HSCT recipients ages 0 to 22 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genital symptoms, genital examination, diagnosis, and treatment of vvGvHD. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants were included in the analysis. The median age at the time of HSCT was 10 years (range 4 months-23 years). Most (n = 40, 71%) underwent transplant for a nonmalignant condition, most commonly sickle cell anemia (n = 19, 33%). The median time of onset of GvHD post HSCT was 62 days (IQR = 42 to 151 days). The most common initial site of GvHD was skin (n = 21, 64%), followed by GI tract (n = 10, 30%). Three patients (5%) were diagnosed with vvGvHD. The time of onset of vvGvHD post HSCT ranged from 62 to 1565 days. One patient (33%) was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. There was no difference in diagnosis of vvGvHD when race (P = 0.15), age at allogeneic HSCT (P = 0.64), nonmalignant vs malignant indication (P = 0.21), source of stem cells (P = 0.25), partial vs full human leukocyte antigens (HLA) donor match (P = 0.34), and GvHD prophylaxis regimen (P = 0.18) were compared. None had isolated vvGvHD. Vulvovaginal GvHD was preceded by skin GvHD in 1 patient, was preceded by lung GvHD in 1 patient, and occurred concurrently with skin GvHD in the third patient. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vvGvHD can occur within the first 100 days after transplant and can be asymptomatic. Routine gynecologic evaluation post allogeneic HSCT in children and adolescents should include a thorough review of vulvovaginal symptoms and a gynecologic exam for the detection and treatment of vvGvHD.

31097628	Long-term event-free survival, chimerism and fertility outcomes in 234 patients with sickle-cell anemia younger than 30 years after myeloablative conditioning and matched-sibling transplantation in France.	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment for sickle cell anemia (SCA), but the place of myeloablative conditioning in the procedure remains to be defined. The aim of the present study was to analyze long-term outcomes, including chimerism, SCA-related events and biological data (hemoglobin, reticulocytes, HbS%), and fertility in a French series of 234 SCA patients under 30 years of age who, from 1988 to 2012, received a matched-sibling-donor stem cell transplantation following standardized myeloablative conditioning [busulfan, cyclophosphamide and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG)]. Since the first report of the series (1988-2004), 151 new consecutive patients with SCA have been similarly transplanted. Considering death, non-engraftment or rejection (donor cells <5%) as events, the 5-year event-free survival was 97.9% (95% confidence interval: 95.5-100%), confirming, since the year 2000, an at least 95% chance of cure. In the overall cohort (n=234, median follow up 7.9 years), event-free survival was not associated with age, but chronic-graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) was independently associated with recipient's age >15 years (hazard ratio=4.37; P=0.002) and lower (5-15 vs 20 mg/kg) ATG dose (hazard ratio=4.55; P=0.001). At one year, 44% of patients had mixed chimerism (5-95% donor cells), but those prepared with ATG had no graft rejection. No events related to SCA occurred in patients with mixed chimerism, even those with 15-20% donor cells, but hemolytic anemia stigmata were observed with donor cells <50%. Myeloablative transplantation with matched-sibling donor currently has a higher event-free survival (98%) in patients under 30 years of age than that reported for non-myeloablative conditioning (88%). Nevertheless, the risk of cGvHD in older patients and the need to preserve fertility might be indications for a non-myeloablative conditioning.
28362411	Continuous Manual Exchange Transfusion for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: An Efficient Method to Avoid Iron Overload.	Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) may be at risk of cerebral vasculopathy and strokes, which can be prevented by chronic transfusion programs. Repeated transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is currently the simplest and most used technique for chronic transfusion programs. However, iron overload is one of the major side effects of this therapy. More developed methods exist, notably the apheresis of RBC (erythrapheresis), which is currently the safest and most efficient method. However, it is costly, complicated, and cannot be implemented everywhere, nor is it suitable for all patients. Manual exchange transfusions combine one or more manual phlebotomies with a PRBC transfusion. At the Reference Center of Sickle Cell Disease, we set up a continuous method of manual exchange transfusion that is feasible for all hospital settings, demands no specific equipment, and is widely applicable. In terms of HbS decrease, stroke prevention, and iron overload prevention, this method showed comparable efficiency to erythrapheresis. In cases where erythrapheresis is not available, this method can be a good alternative for patients and care centers.
37795523	Busulfan-fludarabine- or treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning before allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A study on behalf of the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Inborn Errors Working Parties.	How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD)? We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.

31860969	The role of hydroxyurea to prevent silent stroke in sickle cell disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Chronic blood transfusions are standard of care for stroke prevention in sickle cell disease but is not cost effective and not without risks. Hydroxyurea has emerged as an option in the prevention of silent stroke in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing silent strokes in a systematic review by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the related articles. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of hydroxyurea vs blood transfusions and observational studies evaluating the role of hydroxyurea to prevent stroke and silent stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell beta thalassemia. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software version 13. RESULTS: We included 10 single arm observational studies with 361 participants, and one RCT study with 60 participants receiving hydroxyurea, respectively. There were no deaths attributed to hydroxyurea. The results revealed that 1% (95% CIs 0.0 to 0.05) of patients receiving hydroxyurea had stroke. 18% (95% CIs 0.03 to 0.4) of the hydroxyurea patients had silent stroke. 24% (95% CIs 0.02 to 0.57) of the hydroxyurea patients had adverse events attributed to hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that hydroxyurea is safe and may prevent silent stroke and stroke in sickle cell disease. More high-quality studies including RCTs are needed.
28435037	Therapeutic strategies in Sickle Cell Anemia: The past present and future.	Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) was one of the first hemoglobinopathies to be discovered. It is distinguished by the mutation-induced expression of a sickle cell variant of hemoglobin (HbS) that triggers erythrocytes to take a characteristic sickled conformation. The complex physiopathology of the disease and its associated clinical complications has initiated multi-disciplinary research within its field. This review attempts to lay emphasis on the evolution, current standpoint and future scope of therapeutic strategies in SCA.

29535106	Toward dual hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and solid-organ transplantation for sickle-cell disease.	Sickle-cell disease (SCD) leads to recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, chronic end-organ damage, and resultant physical, psychological, and social disabilities. Although hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for SCD, this procedure is associated with well-recognized morbidity and mortality and thus is ideally offered only to patients at high risk of significant complications. However, it is difficult to identify patients at high risk before significant complications have occurred, and once patients experience significant organ damage, they are considered poor candidates for HSCT. In turn, patients who have experienced long-term organ toxicity from SCD such as renal or liver failure may be candidates for solid-organ transplantation (SOT); however, the transplanted organs are at risk of damage by the original disease. Thus, dual HSCT and organ transplantation could simultaneously replace the failing organ and eliminate the underlying disease process. Advances in HSCT conditioning such as reduced-intensity regimens and alternative donor selection may expand both the feasibility of and potential donor pool for transplantation. This review summarizes the current state of HSCT and organ transplantation in SCD and discusses future directions and the clinical feasibility of dual HSCT/SOT.
31014083	Antibiotic Use and Respiratory Pathogens in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome.	Background: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Historically, the most common pathogens were Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus. Pediatric patients receiving guideline-adherent therapy experienced fewer ACS-related and all-cause 30-day readmissions compared with those receiving nonadherent therapy. This has not been evaluated in adults. Objectives: The primary objectives were to characterize antibiotic use and pathogens. The secondary objective was to assess the occurrence of readmissions associated with guideline-adherent and clinically appropriate treatment compared with regimens that did not meet those criteria. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for adults with SCD hospitalized between August 1, 2014, and July 31, 2017, with pneumonia (PNA) or ACS. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: A total of 139 patients with 255 hospitalizations were reviewed. Among 41 respiratory cultures, 3 organisms were isolated: Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and budding yeast. Respiratory panels were collected on 121 admissions, with 17 positive for 1 virus; all were negative for Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. There were significantly more ACS-/PNA-related 7-day readmissions from patients on guideline-adherent regimens compared with nonadherent regimens (3.7% vs 0%; P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: These findings challenge existing knowledge regarding the most common pathogens in adults with SCD with ACS or PNA. Routine inclusion of a macrolide may not be necessary. Future studies focused on pathogen characterization with standardized assessment are necessary to determine appropriate empirical therapy in this population.
30639825	Functional and Radiologic Assessment of the Brain after Reduced-Intensity Unrelated Donor Transplantation for Severe Sickle Cell Disease: Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Study 0601.	Stroke and cognitive decline are hallmarks of sickle cell disease (SCD). The natural history of SCD predicts progressive loss of 1 IQ point per year attributable to disease-related pathology. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative by reverting to donor-derived erythropoiesis, but evidence that HCT can positively influence disease-induced cognitive decline is lacking. The Sickle Cell Unrelated Transplant Trial prospectively evaluated cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at 2 years after reduced-intensity conditioning followed by unrelated donor HCT. Thirteen study participants completed pre-HCT and post-HCT assessments of intelligence. The mean age of participants was 12.5 +- 3.3 years (range, 6.7 to 17.4 years). Eleven of the 13 recipients completed imaging studies at baseline and post-HCT. Seven had overt stroke pre-HCT, and 1 had an elevated transcranial Doppler velocity with abnormal MRI. The mean Full-Scale IQ was stable: 90.9 +- 13 at baseline and 91.2 +- 13 post-HCT. The mean Performance IQ was 89.9 +- 13 at baseline versus 90.9 +- 13 post-HCT, and mean Verbal IQ was 93.4 +- 13 at baseline versus 93.2 +- 13 post-HCT, respectively. Six recipients had stable MRI; 2 showed resolution of all areas of infarction. Three had additional infarcts post-HCT noted at the 2-year time point. This is the first report describing stabilization of IQ and central nervous system outcomes after unrelated donor HCT despite previous central nervous system morbidity and post-HCT posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. These preliminary results post-HCT suggest that HCT may stabilize the cognitive decline of SCD and should continue to be followed over the long term.
30095446	Pain Control in a Pediatric Patient With Sickle Cell Disease Using Regional Nerve Blocks for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Case Report.	The sickle cell patient population continues to provide challenges in pain control. Current therapies include narcotic usage with adjuvant therapies such as anti-inflammatories and nonpharmacological interventions. Poor pain management in the sickle cell patient population, especially postoperatively, can lead to hypoventilation, escalating opioid requirements, poor recovery, and longer hospital stays. This case report addresses a novel addition of ultrasound-guided paravertebral and rectus sheath blocks postinduction of general anesthesia and before surgical incision to assist with the intravenous postoperative pain management regimen after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 10-year-old boy with sickle cell disease.

32202243	What is the place of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the management of cerebral vasculopathy in children with sickle cell anemia?	Cerebral vasculopathy is the most severe complication affecting children with sickle cell anemia. Significant progress has been made in the management of sickle cell anemia cerebral vasculopathy, including early transcranial Doppler screening, chronic transfusion, andhydroxyurea. Nevertheless, for patients with a potential matched-sibling donor (MSD), stem cell transplantation (SCT) is now the treatment offering the best cerebral vasculopathy outcome. In the absence of MSD,alternative SCT should be recommended only in those with worsening cerebral vasculopathy despite standard treatments, and should be limited to related haplo-identical SCT undertaken in controlled studies.
38570214	Prevention of potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in two sickle cell patients using intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids before and after red blood cell exchange with antigen positive units and review literature.	Emergent Red Blood Cell (RBC) exchange is indicated in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with severe acute chest syndrome. However, fully matched RBC units may not be available for patients with multiple RBC antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids were reported for preventing potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) in simple transfusion of antigen-positive RBCs. We investigated the efficacy and safety of IVIG and steroids in two SCD patients presented with acute chest syndrome receiving RBC exchange with multiple incompatible units. The first patient had multiple historical alloantibodies, including anti-Jsb, although none of them were reactive. IVIG (1 g/kg) was given before and after RBC exchange with methylprednisolone (500 mg IV) one hour before exchange. Her sickle hemoglobin (HbS) was reduced from 89.4% to 17.4% after the exchange with five Jsb-positive units. The patient improved clinically without acute or delayed hemolysis. The second patient had reactive anti-Jsb on two different admissions 18 months apart. Only one of the sixteen units used in the exchanges was Jsb negative. He received the same IVIG regimen during both admissions but 100 mg IV hydrocortisone instead of methylprednisolone. His HbS was reduced from 63.4% to 22.4% after the first exchange. Significant clinical improvements were achieved after both exchanges. No delayed HTR was observed. Our experience of these two patients suggested that IVIG and steroids may be used in preventing potential delayed HTR in some SCD patients with rare antibodies receiving large amounts of antigen-positive RBC products.
38680015	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Multidimentional Review.	While exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy) and lovotibeglogene autotemcel (Lyfgenia) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first cell-based gene therapies for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell disease (SCD), this treatment is not universally accessible. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has the potential to eradicate the symptoms of patients with SCD, but a significant obstacle in HSCT for SCD is the availability of suitable donors, particularly human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors. Furthermore, individuals with SCD face an elevated risk of complications during stem cell transplantation due to SCD-related tissue damage, endothelial activation, and inflammation. Therefore, it is imperative to consider optimal conditioning regimens and investigate HSCT from alternative donors. This review encompasses information on the use of HSCT in patients with SCD, including the indications for HSCT, conditioning regimens, alternative donors, and posttransplant outcomes.
33779245	For which diseases do broader value elements matter most? An evaluation across 20 ICER evidence reports.	BACKGROUND: U.S. value framework developers such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) use cost-effectiveness analysis to value new health care technologies. Often, these value assessment frameworks use a health system perspective without fully accounting for societal and broader benefits and costs of an intervention. Although there is ongoing debate about the most appropriate methods for including broader value elements in value assessment, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of these value elements is likely to affect the quantitative estimates of treatment value. OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in the relevance of broader value elements to cost-effectiveness analysis across diseases. METHODS: Thirty-two broader value elements (e.g., caregiver burden, health equity, real option value, productivity) not traditionally included in health technology assessments were identified through a targeted literature review. Evidence reports published by ICER between July 2017 and January 2020 were evaluated to identify which broader value elements were discussed as relevant to each disease in the report text. The study examined whether there were associations among ICER's discussion of broader value elements, rare disease status, treatment cost, estimated treatment cost-effectiveness, and ICER committee voting results for contextual considerations and additional benefits/disadvantages. RESULTS: The most commonly cited broader value element category in the ICER evidence reports was household and leisure (e.g., absenteeism from normal activities and caregiver burden). More value elements were cited for inherited retinal disease (19 elements) and sickle cell disease (18 elements) than for other diseases. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes had the fewest number of value elements cited (7 elements). Rare diseases were more likely to have broader value elements cited compared with nonrare diseases (15.9 vs. 11.5, P < 0.001). Treatments with higher (i.e., less favorable) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were more likely to have a greater number of broader value elements cited (rho = 0.625, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of broader value elements varied across diseases, with less cost-effective treatments more likely to have a higher number of relevant broader value elements. Inclusion of all relevant value elements in value assessments will more appropriately incentivize innovation and improve allocation of research funding.

34991920	l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, voxelotor, and cell-based therapy for adult sickle cell disease: Hype or hope?	For more than two decades, hydroxyurea was the only therapeutic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Although curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT) were also available, only very few patients underwent the procedure due to lack of matched-related donors. However, therapeutic options for SCD patients increased dramatically in the last few years. Three new agents, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, were approved by the FDA for use in SCD patients. The number of SCD patients who underwent allo-HSCT also increased as a result of advances in the prevention of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease from using mismatched donor HSC. More recently gene therapy was made available on clinical trials. The increased treatment options for SCD have led to a sense of optimism and excitement among many physicians that these new approaches would alter the clinical course and disease burden. Although these newer agents do provide hope to SCD patients, the hyped-up responses need to be evaluated in the context of reality. In this review, we will discuss and compare these new agents and cell-based therapy, evaluate their clinical and economic impacts, and examine their roles in reducing the disease burden.

32305060	Patient and family experience with chronic transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: A qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: There is a limited understanding of the patient and family experience of Chronic Transfusion Therapy (CTT) for prevention of complications of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We sought to understand patient and family experience with CTT using qualitative methods. METHODS: Fifteen parents of children < 18 years old and nine children 12-18 years old with SCD who were receiving CTT for > 1 year were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format, and interviews were analyzed using open coding methods. RESULTS: Four themes created a narrative of the patient and family experience of CTT: 1) Burden of CTT, 2) Coping with CTT, 3) Perceived benefits and risks of CTT, and 4) Decision making regarding CTT. Participants reported substantial burden of CTT, including the impact of CTT on daily life and family, distress about venous access, burden of chelation therapy, and anxiety about CTT complications. Participants described how they coped with CTT. Participants reported increased energy, decreased pain, fewer hospitalizations, and stroke prevention with CTT, but also recognized complications of CTT, though awareness was limited in adolescents. Parents described sharing in the informed decision-making process with their healthcare provider about CTT, but adolescent patient participants reported that they were not involved in this process. CONCLUSIONS: CTT is associated with significant patient and family burden. Support from family, healthcare providers and school may help individuals cope with some of this burden. These findings provide the basis for future studies to identify strategies to mitigate the burden of CTT and improve the patient experience with this therapy. Future studies should also systematically assess patient knowledge about the key components of CTT and chelation using quantitative assessments.

30389037	Moderate-intensity endurance-exercise training in patients with sickle-cell disease without severe chronic complications (EXDRE): an open-label randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Exercise could be a triggering factor for vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle-cell disease. We aimed to investigate whether a patient-adapted training programme of moderate endurance exercise could be safe and beneficial for patients with sickle-cell disease. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial at four university hospitals in France. Eligible patients were older than 18 years, with an HbSS or S/beta0-thalassaemia genotype, and with no severe chronic complications. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) on a stationary bicycle with cardiac, pulmonary, laboratory, and muscle parameter evaluations at the start and end of the study period. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to the training group (three 45-min exercise sessions per week, for 8 weeks) or the control group (no lifestyle changes) using a central computer-generated randomisation list. During baseline evaluation, patients and researchers were masked to group assignment; randomisation was done after completion of the baseline evaluation to minimise bias. The primary outcome was difference in power output at a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L during CPET between baseline and the end of the 8-week training period. Patients were analysed on a per-protocol basis, excluding those who missed more than 20% of the training sessions or had other major protocol violations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02571088, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2014, and Dec 11, 2015, 40 patients were enrolled (20 to each group). After exclusion of seven patients (one pregnancy, one appendicitis, one protocol violation, two lost to follow-up, and two incompatibilities with work schedule), 33 patients were analysed (15 in the training group, 18 in the control group). At the 8-week follow-up, the absolute change from baseline in mean power output at 4 mmol/L blood lactate was 7 2 W (SD 8 7) in trained patients (from 70 4 W [SD 16 2] at baseline to 77 6 W [15 1] at end of intervention) compared with -0 3 W (9 4) in controls (from 66 2 W [13 8] to 65 9 W [15 6]; mean difference between groups 7 3 W [95% CI 0 7-13 8], p=0 031). No adverse events requiring hospital admission occurred in the training group, whereas five occurred in the control group: four (20%) vaso-occlusive crises (one complicated by an acute chest syndrome), and one (6%) viral infection with isolated chest pain (hazard ratio 0 143 [95% CI 0 024-0 827; p=0 029). INTERPRETATION: Moderate-intensity endurance-exercise training seems to be safe for adults with sickle-cell disease without severe chronic complications and significantly improved their functional capacity, especially for exercise levels close to those needed for daily activities. Our findings support consideration of endurance-exercise training as a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with sickle-cell disease.

29335234	A Patient-Held Smartcard With a Unique Identifier and an mHealth Platform to Improve the Availability of Prenatal Test Results in Rural Nigeria: Demonstration Study.	BACKGROUND: Community-based strategies to test for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and sickle cell disease (SCD) have expanded opportunities to increase the proportion of pregnant women who are aware of their diagnosis. In order to use this information to implement evidence-based interventions, these results have to be available to skilled health providers at the point of delivery. Most electronic health platforms are dependent on the availability of reliable Internet connectivity and, thus, have limited use in many rural and resource-limited settings. OBJECTIVE: Here we describe our work on the development and deployment of an integrated mHealth platform that is able to capture medical information, including test results, and encrypt it into a patient-held smartcard that can be read at the point of delivery without the need for an Internet connection. METHODS: We engaged a team of implementation scientists, public health experts, and information technology specialists in a requirement-gathering process to inform the design of a prototype for a platform that uses smartcard technology, database deployment, and mobile phone app development. Key design decisions focused on usability, scalability, and security. RESULTS: We successfully designed an integrated mHealth platform and deployed it in 4 health facilities across Benue State, Nigeria. We developed the Vitira Health platform to store test results of HIV, HBV, and SCD in a database, and securely encrypt the results on a Quick Response code embedded on a smartcard. We used a mobile app to read the contents on the smartcard without the need for Internet connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that it is possible to develop a patient-held smartcard and an mHealth platform that contains vital health information that can be read at the point of delivery using a mobile phone-based app without an Internet connection.

29419425	Safety and efficacy of plerixafor dose escalation for the mobilization of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients with sickle cell disease: interim results.	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is limited by the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells that can be harvested for transduction or gene editing. We therefore performed a phase I dose-escalation study of the hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilizing agent plerixafor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standard dosing on peripheral blood CD34+ cell mobilization. Of 15 patients enrolled to date, only one was chronically transfused and ten were on hydroxyurea. Of eight patients who achieved a CD34+ cell concentration >30 cells/muL, six were on hydroxyurea. There was no clear dose response to increasing plerixafor dosage. There was a low rate of serious adverse events; two patients developed vaso-occlusive crises, at the doses of 80 mug/kg and 240 mug/kg. Hydroxyurea may have contributed to the limited CD34+ mobilization by affecting baseline peripheral blood CD34 counts, which correlated strongly with peak peripheral blood CD34 counts. Plerixafor administration did not induce significant increases in the fraction of activated neutrophils, monocytes, or platelets. However, increased neutrophils positive for activated beta2 integrin and Mac-1 were associated with serious adverse events. In summary, plerixafor was well tolerated but did not achieve consistent CD34+ cell mobilization in this cohort of patients, most of whom were being actively treated with hydroxyurea and only one was chronically transfused. The study will continue with escalation of the dose of plerixafor and modification of hydroxyurea administration. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02193191.
29737522	Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia.	BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia (who are transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent) are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands; which can be prevented and treated with iron chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and well-being, which may affect adherence. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the effectiveness of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component interventions) to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Web of Science Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (01 February 2017). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (12 December 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion.For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational Interventions, or multi-component interventions, non-RCTs, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 RCTs (1525 participants) published between 1997 and 2017. Most participants had beta-thalassaemia major; 195 had SCD and 88 had beta-thalassaemia intermedia. Mean age ranged from 11 to 41 years. One trial was of medication management and 15 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral-chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox.We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low across all outcomes identified in this review.Three trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL.Deferiprone versus deferoxamineWe are uncertain whether deferiprone increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (four trials, very low-quality evidence). Results could not be combined due to considerable heterogeneity (participants' age and different medication regimens). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone (85% to 94.9%); deferoxamine (71.6% to 93%)).We are uncertain whether deferiprone increases the risk of agranulocytosis, risk ratio (RR) 7.88 (99% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 352.39); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.63) (one trial; 88 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferasirox versus deferoxamineWe are uncertain whether deferasirox increases adherence to iron chelation therapy, mean difference (MD) -1.40 (95% CI -3.66 to 0.86) (one trial; 197 participants; very-low quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferasirox (99%); deferoxamine (100%)). We are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of thalassaemia-related serious adverse events (SAEs), RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.17); or all-cause mortality, RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.06) (two trials; 240 participants; very low-quality evidence).We are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of SCD-related pain crises, RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.62); or other SCD-related SAEs, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.51) (one trial; 195 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT)Deferasirox FCT may make little or no difference to adherence, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.22) (one trial; 173 participants; low-quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (FCT (92.9%); DT (85.3%)).We are uncertain if deferasirox FCT increases the incidence of SAEs, RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.37); or all-cause mortality, RR 2.97 (95% CI 0.12 to 71.81) (one trial; 173 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if deferiprone and deferoxamine combined increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (very low-quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone 92.7% (range 37% to 100%) to 93.6% (range 56% to 100%); deferoxamine 70.6% (range 25% to 100%).Combination therapy may make little or no difference to the risk of SAEs, RR 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.81) (one trial; 213 participants; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain if combination therapy decreases all-cause mortality, RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.18 to 3.35) (two trials; 237 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine aloneDeferiprone and deferoxamine combined may have little or no effect on adherence to iron chelation therapy (four trials; 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferoxamine 91.4% to 96.1%; deferiprone: 82.4%)Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined, may have little or no difference in SAEs or mortality (low-quality evidence). No SAEs occurred in three trials and were not reported in one trial. No deaths occurred in two trials and were not reported in two trials.Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combinedDeferiprone and deferasirox combined may improve adherence to iron chelation therapy, RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one trial; 96 participants; low-quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone and deferoxamine: 80%; deferiprone and deferasirox: 95%).We are uncertain if deferiprone and deferasirox decreases the incidence of SAEs, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.53) (one trial; 96 participants; very low-quality evidence).There were no deaths in the trial (low-quality evidence).Medication management versus standard careWe are uncertain if medication management improves health-related QoL (one trial; 48 participants; very low-quality evidence). Adherence was only measured in one arm of the trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects.Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation.Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy.Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups.
29958563	Genetic therapies for sickle cell disease.	After decades with few novel therapeutic options for sickle cell disease (SCD), autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) based genetic therapies including lentiviral gene therapy (GT), and genome editing (GE) now appear imminent. Lentiviral GT has advanced considerably in the past decade with promising clinical trial results in multiple disorders. For beta-hemoglobinopathies, GT strategies of gene addition and fetal hemoglobin induction through BCL11A regulation are both being evaluated in open clinical trials. GE techniques offer the possibility of a nonviral curative approach, either through sickle hemoglobin mutation repair or fetal hemoglobin elevation. Although GE currently remains at the preclinical stage, multiple clinical trials will likely open soon. In addition to reviewing current strategies for GT and GE, this review highlights important next steps toward optimization of these therapies. All autologous cell-based genetic therapies rely on safely obtaining an adequate yield of autologous HSCs for genetic modification and transplantation. HSC collection is uniquely challenging in SCD. Peripheral mobilization with plerixafor has recently emerged as a promising approach. The acute and long-term toxicities associated with myeloablative conditioning are risks that may not be acceptable to a significant number of SCD patients, highlighting the need for novel conditioning regimens. Finally, increasing availability of autologous genetic therapies will require comprehensive and collaborative discussions regarding cost and access for SCD patients, at individual centers and worldwide.

BACKGROUND: International trials suggest benefit of revascularization surgery (RS) for moyamoya disease (MMD). However, nationally representative US data on demographics and outcomes after RS in MMD are lacking. AIMS: To estimate causes and rates of readmission after RS for MMD. METHODS: In the Nationwide Readmissions Database, index admissions for ECICB for MMD and readmissions for ischemic stroke (IS), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. We summarized demographics and comorbidities, and calculated 30-, 60-, and 90-day readmission rates per 100,000 index admissions. RESULTS: Among 201 index admissions for RS for MMD, mean age (SD) was 41.7 (12.6) years; 75% were female; 24% had diabetes; 53% had hypertension; 40% had hypercholesterolemia; 3% had ICH; 16% had IS; and 1% had SAH. RS was performed at large hospitals in 83%, urban hospitals in 85%, and teaching hospitals in 97%. 80% were discharged home. 34% had a readmission during follow-up. Leading reasons for readmission up to 90 days included MMD (62%), postoperative infection (10%), sickle cell crisis (4%), ischemic stroke (4%), epilepsy (2%), subdural hemorrhage (2%) and headache (2%). Readmission rates (per 100,000 index admissions) were 559 at 30 days, 1829 at 60 days, and 2027 at 90 days for IS. There were no readmissions for SAH or ICH. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of nationally representative US data suggests that although readmission after RS for MMD is not uncommon, cerebral hemorrhagic events during the 90-day postoperative period are rare.
29724898	How I safely transfuse patients with sickle-cell disease and manage delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.	Transfusions can be a life-saving treatment of patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD). However, availability of matched units can be limiting because of distinctive blood group polymorphisms in patients of African descent. Development of antibodies against the transfused red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), can be life-threatening and pose unique challenges for this population with regard to treatment strategies and transfusion management protocols. In cases where the transfused cells and the patient's own RBCs are destroyed, diagnosis of DHTR can be difficult because symptoms may mimic vaso-occlusive crisis, and frequently, antibodies are undetectable. Guidelines are needed for early diagnosis of DHTR because treatment may need to include temporarily withholding any new transfusions to avoid further hemolysis. Also needed are case-control studies to optimally tailor treatments based on the severity of DHTR and develop preventive transfusion strategies for patients at DHTR risk. Here, we will review gaps in knowledge and describe through case studies our recommended approach to prevent alloimmunization and to diagnose and treat symptomatic DHTRs for which complementary mechanistic studies to understand their pathogenesis are sorely needed.
34090800	Topical Vapocoolant-Associated Vaso-occlusive Event in a 10-year-old with Sickle Cell Disease.	Vapocoolant sprays are convenient forms of cold temperature analgesia. These sprays may not be suitable for all patients with particular concern for patients with sickle cell disease. To prevent any further cases from occurring, we propose adding a more specific cautionary statement to the manufacturer guidelines. We also hope that medical personnel can help patients with sickle cell avoid topical and environmental cold temperature triggers for sickle vaso-occlusive pain and reduce the suffering in this rare disease.
38454604	Autologous Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: From Bench to Patient's Bedside.	In recent years, a growing number of clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate gene therapy approaches for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic modalities being assessed in these trials utilize different molecular techniques, including lentiviral vectors to add functional copies of the gene encoding the hemoglobin beta subunit in defective cells and CRISPR/Cas9, TALE nuclease (TALEN), and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) gene editing strategies to either directly address the underlying genetic cause of disease or induce fetal hemoglobin production by gene disruption. Here, we review the mechanisms of action of these various gene addition and gene editing approaches and describe the status of clinical trials designed to evaluate the potentially for these approaches to provide one-time functional cures to patients with TDT and SCD.
31583977	Randomized Pilot Study: A Mobile Technology-based Self-management Intervention for Sickle Cell Pain.	Little is known about the effects of self-managed relaxation interventions on pain, stress, and autonomic responses in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This pre-post randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using computer tablets for relaxation intervention delivery; acceptability of study procedures; and intervention effects on pain, stress, and indicators of relaxation. The 30 research participants ranged in age from 22 years to 59 years. All were African American; 53% were male. They were randomized to an experimental group that watched a relaxation video or a control group that discussed their disease. All participants completed the study, indicating feasibility. Acceptability rates were also high. Data were obtained for the intervention's immediate effect on pain, stress, respiration, pulse, finger skin temperature, and self-reported relaxation. These preliminary findings will guide future, higher-powered studies to determine the intervention's efficacy and mechanism in SCD.The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02729363.
34080441	Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported >= 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
32885834	Adjuvant interventions with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: A mixed treatment network meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.	"OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive crisis is the most common clinical feature requiring opioid analgesics in patients with sickle cell disease. We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the drugs that can be used as add-on with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS: Sickle cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crisis receiving adjuvants to opioids for pain management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A number of patients with complete pain relief and pain scores assessed either by visual ana-log or by a numerical rating scale were the primary outcomes. Adverse events and dose of opioids (in morphine equiva-lents) for pain alleviation between the treatment arms were the secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Eleven studies evaluating the addition of ketorolac, magnesium sulfate, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, methadone, inhalational nitric oxide, methylprednisolone, and arginine with morphine were obtained. The pooled analysis showed a favorable effect in the pain reduction for the additions of arginine {-2 [-3.39, -0.61]} and ibuprofen {-1.7 [-3.26, -0.14]} with morphine. Arginine has high probability of being the ""best"" in the pool followed by ibuprofen. No significant differ-ences were observed in the risk of adverse events {ketoprofen-0.84 [0.42, 1.65]; magnesium sulfate-1.81 [0.64, 5.81]; and arginine-2.08 [0.18, 24.31]}. A significant lower dose of opioid was required when given adjunctive to argin-ine, inhalational nitric oxide, and methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: We observed that arginine and ibuprofen could produce additional analgesic effects when combined with morphine in vaso-occlusive crisis."
36781119	Preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in adult patients with sickle cell anemia: A cohort study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial aneurysms are frequent in patients with sickle cell anemia, while subarachnoid hemorrhage is a major cause of death and disability in young adult patients. Several characteristics, such as younger age and smaller size at rupture, may incline therapeutic decision towards exclusion treatments. Clinical guidelines on treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in this population are still missing. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm in patients with sickle cell anemia, using an adapted hematological preparation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with sickle cell anemia and treated unruptured aneurysms by endovascular therapy or neurosurgery were included in this retrospective cohort study. Treatment decision was reached after multi-disciplinary assessment. A pre-operative blood transfusion protocol was undertaken targeting a HbS below 30%. Demographic data, hematological preparation parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were documented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 patients encompassing 19 aneurysms treated by embolization and 6 by surgery. Median age at treatment was 34 years-old and median aneurysm dome size was 4.4 mm. Immediate aneurysm exclusion rate was 85.7% after endovascular therapy and 100% after neurosurgery. Median follow-up was 6 months, with all patients being asymptomatic at last follow-up. Two transitory ischemic neurological deficits, as well as four cases of iodine-induced encephalopathy were identified after embolization. No complication occurred after surgery. Endovascular therapy by coiling and neurosurgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms appears to be safe in patients with sickle cell anemia and should be considered given the specific hemorrhagic risk observed in this population. A rigorous hematological preparation, associated with a dedicated peri-operative protocol and an adequate therapeutic strategy are essential prerequisites.
33362271	Clinical characteristics of paediatric autoimmune hepatitis at a referral hospital in Sub Saharan Africa.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology. The number of reported AIH cases is increasing in the developed countries but the same cannot be said about sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Paediatric AIH diagnosis is usually missed and patients present with decompensated liver disease. Our study highlights the clinical profile of paediatric AIH cases at a referral hospital in Ghana. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all cases of children diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis at the gastroenterology clinic in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Data was extracted from the patients' records from April 2016 to October 2019. These children were diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies, elevated immunoglobulin G and histologic presence of interphase hepatitis with the exclusion of hepatitis A, B, C and E depending on their clinical presentation, Wilson's disease, HIV, Schistosomiasis and sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Thirteen patients aged between 5 years to 13 years with a mean age of 10 years were diagnosed with AIH. All the patients had type 1 AIH with majority 8 (61.5%) being females. Most of the children presented with advanced liver disease with complications. Three patients had other associated autoimmune diseases. The patients were treated with prednisolone with or without azathioprine depending on the severity of the liver disease. CONCLUSION: Majority of paediatric AIH presents with advanced liver disease. There is the need for early detection to change the natural history of AIH in SSA.
38506484	Using the daily rate of rise in hemoglobin S to manage RBC depletion/exchange treatment in sickle cell disease.	"BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is often used prophylactically in patients with sickle cell disease, with the goal to maintain hemoglobin S (HbS) below a target threshold level. We reviewed whether the daily ""rate of rise"" (RoR) in HbS that occurs between procedures can be used for patient management. For some patients not achieving their HbS goals despite efficient exchanges, the post-procedure hematocrit (Hct) target is increased to potentially suppress HbS production. This case series explores the utility of this approach, other clinical uses of the daily RoR in HbS, and the factors that influence it. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 660 procedures from 24 patients undergoing prophylactic RBC depletion/exchange procedures were included. Laboratory values and clinical parameters were collected and used to calculate the daily RoR in HbS. Factors such as Hct or medications that might influence the RoR in HbS were evaluated. RESULTS: The RoR in HbS varied widely between patients but remained relatively stable within individuals. Surprisingly, this value was not significantly influenced by changes in post-procedure Hct or concurrent hydroxyurea use. A patient's average RoR in HbS effectively predicted the pre-procedure HbS at the following visit (R2  = 0.65). DISCUSSION: The RoR in HbS is a relatively consistent parameter for individual patients that is unaffected by medication use or procedural Hct targets and may be useful in determining intervals between procedures."
28913922	A clinically meaningful fetal hemoglobin threshold for children with sickle cell anemia during hydroxyurea therapy.	Hydroxyurea has proven clinical benefits and is recommended to be offered to all children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but the optimal dosing regimen remains controversial. Induction of red blood cell fetal hemoglobin (HbF) by hydroxyurea appears to be dose-dependent. However, it is unknown whether maximizing HbF% improves clinical outcomes. HUSTLE (NCT00305175) is a prospective observational study with a primary goal of describing the long-term clinical effects of hydroxyurea escalated to maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in children with SCA. In 230 children, providing 610 patient-years of follow up, the mean attained HbF% at MTD was >20% for up to 4 years of follow-up. When HbF% values were <=20%, children had twice the odds of hospitalization for any reason (P < .0001), including vaso-occlusive pain (P < .01) and acute chest syndrome (ACS) (P < .01), and more than four times the odds of admission for fever (P < .001). Thirty day readmission rates were not affected by HbF%. Neutropenia (ANC <1000 x 106 /L) was rare (2.3% of all laboratory monitoring), transient, and benign. Therefore, attaining HbF >20% was associated with fewer hospitalizations without significant toxicity. These data support the use of hydroxyurea in children, and suggest that the preferred dosing strategy is one that targets a HbF endpoint >20%.
38285418	Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease.	This article presents a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes at home.
31483336	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cellular therapy in sickle cell disease: where are we now?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common monogenic disorder that is characterized by an A to T substitution in the beta-globin gene that leads to the production of hemoglobin S (HbS). Polymerization of HbS leads to significant morbidity including vaso-occlusion, pain, hemolytic anemia, and end organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the only curative treatment; however, suitable donors are not always readily available. This study reviews the current status of allo-HCT and autologous cellular therapies for SCD. RECENT FINDINGS: Alternative sources of allogeneic stem cells from unmatched donors such as cord blood and haploidentical donors are gaining traction. Early experience has shown that better conditioning regimens and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis are needed before these donor sources can gain widespread use. Clinical trials are underway to determine the feasibility and efficacy of autologous transplantation with gene modified hematopoietic stem cells. Gene therapy strategies include HbS gene correction, gene addition, and hemoglobin F induction. Preliminary results are very encouraging. SUMMARY: Matched sibling allo-HCT for patients with SCD results in more than 90% overall survival and more than 80% event-free survival. Because only 25-30% of patients have a matched sibling donor, alternative donor options such as matched unrelated donors, related haploidentical donors and unrelated umbilical cord blood donors are being considered. Clinical trials investigating various strategies for gene therapy followed by autologous transplantation are underway. One major challenge is obtaining sufficient hematopoietic stem cells for gene therapy. Studies are being conducted on the optimal mobilization regimen and collection strategy.
29377071	How I manage red cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest serious inherited diseases in the world, and red cell transfusion is still one of the few effective treatments for acute and chronic complications. Transfusion corrects anaemia and dilutes out the number of red cells able to cause vaso-occlusion and vascular damage. Urgent red cell transfusions are used to correct acute anaemia, treat acute chest syndrome and patients with acute neurological symptoms. We use elective transfusions preoperatively for moderate risk surgery, and in some pregnant women. There is good evidence for the use of long-term regular transfusions in primary stroke prevention, with the aim of keeping the percentage of sickle haemoglobin below 30%. Long-term transfusions are also used in secondary stroke prevention, and the management of progressive organ damage, including renal impairment and pulmonary hypertension. Blood needs to be matched for ABO, RH and Kell, although alloantibodies may still develop and require more careful, extended cross-matching. Delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions are relatively common, difficult to diagnose and manage, and potentially fatal.
30021096	A Phase 3 Trial of l-Glutamine in Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress contributes to the complex pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Oral therapy with pharmaceutical-grade l-glutamine (USAN, glutamine) has been shown to increase the proportion of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes, which probably reduces oxidative stress and could result in fewer episodes of sickle cell-related pain. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we tested the efficacy of pharmaceutical-grade l-glutamine (0.3 g per kilogram of body weight per dose) administered twice daily by mouth, as compared with placebo, in reducing the incidence of pain crises among patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle beta0-thalassemia and a history of two or more pain crises during the previous year. Patients who were receiving hydroxyurea at a dose that had been stable for at least 3 months before screening continued that therapy through the 48-week treatment period. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients (age range, 5 to 58 years; 53.9% female) were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive l-glutamine (152 patients) or placebo (78 patients). The patients in the l-glutamine group had significantly fewer pain crises than those in the placebo group (P=0.005), with a median of 3.0 in the l-glutamine group and 4.0 in the placebo group. Fewer hospitalizations occurred in the l-glutamine group than in the placebo group (P=0.005), with a median of 2.0 in the l-glutamine group and 3.0 in the placebo group. Two thirds of the patients in both trial groups received concomitant hydroxyurea. Low-grade nausea, noncardiac chest pain, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain occurred more frequently in the l-glutamine group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adults with sickle cell anemia, the median number of pain crises over 48 weeks was lower among those who received oral therapy with l-glutamine, administered alone or with hydroxyurea, than among those who received placebo, with or without hydroxyurea.

31724541	Serum Folate Levels in Patients with Chronic Hemolytic Anemia on Regular Folic Acid Supplementation Before and After Dose Modification.	OBJECTIVE: In light of the recommendation of folic acid supplementation in chronic hemolytic anemia, with possible supratherapeutic dosing and associated side effects, we performed this study to investigate serum folate levels in children with chronic hemolytic anemia. METHODS: Phase 1 was a cross-sectional study of 134 patients in the Pediatric Hematology service, documenting daily dosage and performing serum folate levels. In phase 2, we reduced the dose to 1 mg for 148 patients and repeated the testing after six months. RESULTS: We found very high serum folate levels with Phase 1, with 93.2% above the upper level of normal. In Phase 2, values remained high with 42.5% above the acceptable upper limit. CONCLUSION: Doses of folic acid given to sickle cell and thalassemia patients exceed their actual needs. This should be re-evaluated to strike a balance between benefit and harm, with close monitoring of serum folate levels.
37092306	Revisiting the benefits of isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange (IHD-RCE) is a modified form of the standard red cell exchange (STD-RCE), intended to reduce red cell requirements in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This retrospective crossover analysis of nine patients aims to add to the limited existing literature on IHD-RCE and address the equipoise regarding whether the benefits of (a) decreased RBC usage per exchange and (b) increased interprocedure interval (via lower fraction of cells remaining, FCR) can be observed at the same time, in the same patient. METHODS: At a single center, we identified 37 patients with SCD undergoing chronic RCE between 2014 and 2021. We excluded those patients who did not have at least six consecutive procedures of each type (STD- and IHD-RCE), arriving at nine patients for analysis. RESULTS: When using greater decreases in hematocrit than previously published, we did not find that IHD-RCE resulted in any clinically apparent adverse events. We did find greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure and increases in heart rate in some patients, as compared to STD-RCE. After correcting for total blood volume, seven of the nine patients had significantly reduced red cell requirements with each IHD-RCE. Because the pattern of achieving a lower FCR than programmed was seen to an equal extent with both IHD-RCE and STD-RCE, none of the nine patients showed any statistical difference in actual FCR between procedure types. DISCUSSION: Our data do not support the observation of both IHD-RCE benefits, decreased red cell usage per exchange and lower FCR/increased interprocedure interval, simultaneously.
30373875	Bone Marrow Necrosis in Sickle Cell-Beta Thalassemia Patient Mimicking Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.	We describe a case of bone marrow necrosis (BMN) with subsequent fat embolism precipitated by high altitudes in a young healthy man with previously undiagnosed sickle cell-beta thalassemia. This case report adds to the growing literature on the complexity of diagnosing bone marrow necrosis given that the clinical and laboratory features mimic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This BMN with fat embolism syndrome (FES) is novel in that it was precipitated by high altitudes and the patient was treated successfully with a series of therapeutic plasma exchanges and red blood cell transfusions alone, without any adverse long-term complications to the patient.
35072359	Successful use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute chest syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease and SARS-CoV-2.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the successful native lung recovery of a child with SCD referred for lung transplant (LTx) evaluation who was on prolonged veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He initially presented with acute chest syndrome complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection that ultimately required dual-lumen, single bicaval VV-ECMO cannulation for respiratory support. Despite the increased risk of hemolysis and thrombosis from SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was successfully supported on VV-ECMO for 71 days without complications leading to native lung recovery with meticulous management of his SCD therapy. This report provides new insight on our approach to VV-ECMO support in a child with SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a successful outcome, the patient has returned home but still on mechanical ventilation with LTx still an option if he is not eventually liberated from invasive respiratory support.
34274957	Matched related hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease with alemtuzumab: the Texas Children's Hospital experience.	Serotherapeutic agents facilitate engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Anti-thymocyte globulin is generally added to conditioning chemotherapy for matched related donor transplant (MRD-HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Alemtuzumab, however, is appealing due to its broad lymphocyte killing that may achieve very low rejection and GVHD rates. To assess the impact of alemtuzumab in MRD-HCT for SCD, we retrospectively reviewed transplant-related outcomes and markers of immunity in 38 consecutive patients at Texas Children's Hospital having received myeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab. Median follow-up was 4.8 years (range: 0.2-17). All patients engrafted. Donor chimerism was mixed in 47.1% of patients at >=2-years. Donor chimerism <50% was uncommon (n = 2). One patient with low myeloid chimerism (19%) had sickle-related hemolysis at 10-years. Incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV (5.3%) and extensive chronic GVHD (2.8%) was very low. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and composite chronic GVHD-EFS were excellent at 94.7% (95% CI: 80.3, 98.6) and 89.2% (95% CI: 73.7, 95.8), respectively. Infections did not contribute to mortality although cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred commonly in the first 3 months after transplant. Our data suggest potential for alemtuzumab in myeloablative transplant for children with SCD although further evaluation in older patients and with unrelated donors is warranted.
32507420	Integrative approaches to treating pain in sickle cell disease: Pre-clinical and clinical evidence.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by hemolysis, end-organ damage, inflammation, and pain. Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises are a unique feature of SCD. Many patients also develop lifelong chronic pain. Opioids are the primary method of pain treatment in SCD; however, continued use is associated with several adverse effects. Integrative approaches to treating pain in SCD are increasingly being explored to prevent the side effects associated with opioids. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of pain in SCD and describe mechanism-based integrative approaches for treating pain.
28183857	Coexistent Sickle Cell Disease Has No Impact on the Safety or Outcome of Lytic Therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Findings From Get With The Guidelines-Stroke.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The recommended treatment for ischemic stroke is tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator). Although sickle cell disease (SCD) represents no known contraindication to tPA, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health recommended acute exchange transfusion for stroke in SCD, not tPA. Data on safety and outcomes of tPA in patients are needed to guide tPA use in SCD. METHODS: We matched patients from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry with SCD to patients without SCD and compared usage, complications, and discharge outcomes after tPA. Multivariable logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to assess outcomes. RESULTS: From 2 016 652 stroke patients admitted to Get With The Guidelines-Stroke sites in the United States, 832 SCD and 3328 non-SCD controls with no differences in admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or blood pressure were identified. Neither the fraction receiving thrombolytic therapy (8.2% for SCD versus 9.4% non-SCD) nor symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (4.9% of SCD versus 3.2% non-SCD; P=0.4502) was different. There was no difference in a prespecified set of outcome measures for those with SCD compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Coexistent SCD had no significant impact on the safety or outcome of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke. Although the sample size is relatively small, these data suggest that adults with SCD and acute ischemic stroke should be treated with thrombolysis, if they otherwise qualify. Addition studies, however, should track the intracranial hemorrhage rate and provide information on other SCD-related care such as transfusion.
28887325	At least 20% donor myeloid chimerism is necessary to reverse the sickle phenotype after allogeneic HSCT.	Novel curative therapies using genetic transfer of normal globin-producing genes into autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are in clinical trials for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The percentage of transferred globin necessary to cure SCD is currently not known. In the setting of allogeneic nonmyeloablative HSC transplants (HSCTs), stable mixed chimerism is sufficient to reverse the disease. We regularly monitored 67 patients after HSCT. After initially robust engraftment, 3 of these patients experienced declining donor myeloid chimerism (DMC) levels with eventual return of disease. From this we discovered that 20% DMC is necessary to reverse the sickle phenotype. We subsequently developed a mathematical model to test the hypothesis that the percentage of DMC necessary is determined solely by differences between donor and recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival times. In our model, the required 20% DMC can be entirely explained by the large differences between donor and recipient RBC survival times. Our model predicts that the requisite DMC and therefore necessary level of transferred globin is lowest in patients with the highest reticulocyte counts and concomitantly shortened RBC lifespans.
30979566	Challenges in preventing and treating hemolytic complications associated with red blood cell transfusion.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support represents a critical component of sickle cell disease (SCD) management. However, as with any therapeutic intervention, RBC transfusion is not without risk. Repeat exposure to allogeneic RBCs can result in the development of RBC alloantibodies that can make it difficult to find compatible RBCs for future transfusions and can directly increase the risk of developing acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, which can be further complicated by hyperhemolysis. Several prophylactic and treatment strategies have been employed in an effort to reduce or prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions. However, conflicting data exist regarding the efficacy of many of these approaches. We will explore the challenges associated with predicting, preventing and treating different types of hemolytic transfusion reactions in patients with SCD in addition to describing future strategies that may aid in the management of the complex transfusion requirements of SCD patients.
32614473	Preoperative blood transfusions for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing:   an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);   serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:   a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence).   a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence);   any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSbeta+ disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.

29605204	Pulmonary hypertension in chronic hemolytic anemias: Pathophysiology and treatment.	Pulmonary hypertension has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hemoglobinopathies and chronic hemolytic anemias. These hematological diseases include - but are not limited to - sickle cell disease (SCD), thalassemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria, and hereditary spherocytosis. Although most studies have been based on the use of echocardiography as a screening tool for pulmonary hypertension as opposed to the gold standard of right heart catheterization for definitive diagnosis, the association between chronic hemolytic anemia and pulmonary hypertension is evident. Studies have shown that patients with SCD and a tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) >= 2.5 m/sec are at increased risk of pulmonary hypertension and are at increased mortality risk. Additional markers of risk of pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality include a pro-BNP >160 pg/mL combined with a 6-min walk distance of <333 m. There is currently a lack of concrete data to support the use of targeted oral pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in chronic hemolytic anemia. As a result, management is generally targeted towards medical optimization of the underlying anemia. This literature review aims to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic and prognostic tools, recent studies and current protocols that are essential in guiding management of pulmonary hypertension in chronic hemolytic anemias.

34898140	Acute Myeloid Leukemia Case after Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.	Gene therapy with LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111, lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of a patient's hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector that encodes the betaA-T87Q-globin gene. Acute myeloid leukemia developed in a woman approximately 5.5 years after she had received LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease as part of the initial cohort (Group A) of the HGB-206 study. An analysis of peripheral-blood samples revealed that blast cells contained a BB305 lentiviral vector insertion site. The results of an investigation of causality indicated that the leukemia was unlikely to be related to vector insertion, given the location of the insertion site, the very low transgene expression in blast cells, and the lack of an effect on expression of surrounding genes. Several somatic mutations predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia were present after diagnosis, which suggests that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for hematologic malignant conditions after transplantation, most likely because of a combination of risks associated with underlying sickle cell disease, transplantation procedure, and inadequate disease control after treatment.

35679148	Safety and Acceptance of Acupuncture and Acupressure in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with significant morbidity and high symptom burden including mucositis pain, nausea, and vomiting. There is little documentation in the literature regarding acupuncture or acupressure for children undergoing HSCT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and acceptance of acupuncture and acupressure in children undergoing HSCT in a large tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study that evaluated 80 admissions to the HSCT unit over a 24-month period. Every child admitted for HSCT was offered acupuncture or acupressure as part of their care. RESULTS: Of 80 patients, 46 were male patients (ages range, 0-32 years; mean, 8 years). Diagnoses include leukemia/lymphoma, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, neuroblastoma, and other metabolic, other solid tumor, or other hematologic disorders. Both allogenic and autologous were represented. Sixty-six patients (82.5%) agreed to treatment with acupuncture, acupressure, or both. There were no adverse effects or safety concerns noted. Symptoms addressed by acupuncture or acupressure included pain from mucositis, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, and general wellness or healing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupuncture and acupressure are well accepted by children and their families admitted for HSCT and are safe even when performed in the first 4 weeks following transplant when the patient is likely to have thrombocytopenia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that there may be more therapies for patients undergoing HSCT to help with symptom control.

33974588	Maintenance of an Immunogenic Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease because of splenic dysfunction. To mitigate this risk, patients are protected with prophylactic penicillin until completion of pneumococcal vaccination series. The objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of a protective immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in children with SCD. A retrospective review was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020 of all patients with SCD patients for whom it had been 5+-1 year since completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. A total of 41 patients were analyzed. The majority of children (68%) were able to maintain an adequate immune response. There was no identifiable disease characteristic associated with maintenance of an appropriate immunogenic response. This study finds that patients with SCD are able to maintain an adequate immune response at the 5+-1 year time point from completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. Similarly, patients were not found to have an increased rate of invasive pneumococcal disease even if not meeting criteria for adequate pneumococcal serum titer levels. Maintenance of pneumococcal titers suggests that there may not be a need for revaccination at the 5-year time point in this patient population.
36485115	Long-term health outcomes following curative therapies for sickle cell disease.	Treatment options for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) continue to rapidly expand and evolve. The goal of therapies such as an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene therapy, and gene editing is to cure rather than control SCD. The benefits of these therapies must be accompanied by minimizing long-term adverse health outcomes from SCD and its treatment. SCD can have adverse effects on a variety of organ systems, including the heart, lung, kidney, and reproductive system, leading to high disease burden, morbidity, and premature mortality in both pediatric and adult patients. While curative therapies are being increasingly used, there remains a paucity of data on the long-term health outcomes associated with these treatments in children and adults with SCD. There are data available regarding the effects of HSCT performed largely for malignant diseases, from which data on SCD outcomes may be extrapolated. However, given the significant differences between these 2 populations of patients who undergo HSCT, such extrapolation is imprecise at best. Furthermore, there are currently no published data on long-term health outcomes following gene therapy for SCD due to current short follow-up times. We summarize the limited data reported on health outcomes following HSCT for SCD and emphasize the need for more research within this area.
33029796	Hydroxyurea Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients After Total Pancreatectomy With Islet Autotransplantation.	Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation is a complex surgical approach for acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis that frequently triggers extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >= 1000 x 109 /L). Thrombocytosis can be prothrombotic, so cytoreductive hydroxyurea is often initiated after this surgery; however, optimal dosing strategy and efficacy are unknown. This prospective pilot study characterized the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea after this procedure in children. It also compared them with previously published pediatric parameters in sickle cell anemia (SCA), the disease in which pediatric hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics have primarily been studied. Plasma hydroxyurea levels were quantified in 14 participants aged 4-19 years using high-performance liquid chromatography. Blood collections were scheduled 20 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours after the first dose, on pharmacokinetic day 1 (PK1), and again 2-3 months later if still on hydroxyurea (PK2). Six participants had PK1 and PK2 data at all 3 postdose timed collections, 5 only had PK1 samples, and 3 only had PK2 samples. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation participants had reduced and delayed absorption compared with sickle cell anemia participant data from the Hydroxyurea Study of Long-Term Effects, regardless of timing or dosing methodology. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation participants had different pharmacokinetic profiles at PK1 versus PK2, with lower dose-normalized exposures than previously reported in sickle cell anemia. These results suggest variability exists in hydroxyurea absorption and bioavailability in total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation patients, suspected to be primarily because of Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and suggest that more pharmacokinetic data are needed for scenarios when hydroxyurea is prescribed to children without sickle cell anemia.
28748876	End-stage renal disease in patients with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell nephropathy is a severe complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that has a wide range of manifestations, from asymptomatic microalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The data on patients with SCD who develop ESRD are scarce. The aim of this study was to explore the course of patients with SCD who developed ESRD and received renal replacement therapy (RRT). The course of patients with SCD who developed ESRD and started dialysis at two centers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia was retrospectively analyzed. Parameters included age at initiation of dialysis, survival until death or kidney transplantation, hospitalization due to pain crisis, disease-related parameters, and requirement for blood transfusion. Sixteen patients with SCD developed ESRD and started RRT with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The mean age at initiation of dialysis was 46.6 years. The majority of patients (10 out of 16) were resistant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and required blood transfusion repeatedly. Pain crises were infrequently encountered. Median survival was 54 months. Four patients received kidney transplantation with good outcome. In conclusion, most patients with SCD who developed ESRD were resistant to ESA and required repeated blood transfusion. The rate of hospitalization due to pain crisis was relatively low. Survival on dialysis was comparable to that of patients with no SCD, and the post-transplant course was relatively benign.

30151977	Impact of early analgesia on hospitalization outcomes for sickle cell pain crisis.	BACKGROUND: Painful events are the leading cause of hospitalizations for patients with sickle cell disease. Individualized pain plans targeting patient-specific maximum opioid dosing may shorten hospitalization length and are recommended by national guidelines. Prior to implementing individualized sickle cell pain plans, we tested the hypothesis that a shorter time to achieve a maximum opioid dose would improve hospitalization outcomes. PROCEDURE: Two-year IRB-approved, retrospective study of pediatric patients admitted for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). We recorded the emergency department admission time, order entry time for the maximum opioid dose during the hospitalization, and time of discharge orders.  We categorized patients as infrequent if they required <3 admissions for VOC over two years and patients as frequent if they required >=3 admissions for VOC over two years. To account for multiple admissions, generalized linear modeling was performed. RESULTS: We identified 236 admissions for acute pain observed in 108 patients. Achieving an earlier maximum opioid dose was significantly associated with shorter length of hospitalization for frequent and infrequent pain patients (both P <= 0.0001). As total hospitalization length can be impacted by the time a maximum opioid order was placed, we also analyzed hospitalization length after the maximum opioid order was placed. Frequent pain patients who achieved earlier analgesia had a significantly shorter hospitalization from the time the maximum opioid order was placed (P = 0.03) while no association was found for infrequent pain patients (P = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Early achievement of maximum analgesia improved hospitalization outcomes and warrant further investigation in prospective studies of individualized pain plans.
28696845	Decompensated Cirrhosis and Sickle Cell Disease: Case Reports and Review of the Literature.	Although its prevalence is unknown, liver involvement by sickle cell disease is not uncommon and encompasses different clinical spectra including non cholestatic and cholestatic disorders. Few data have been provided on chronic sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis (SCIC) clinical course, although cirrhosis has been reported in sickle cell disease. However, no effective therapeutic approaches have been recognized either to prevent or treat this condition. Here we present two cases of adult sickle cell disease patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Their liver biopsies showed sickle cell thrombi within the hepatic sinusoids. Despite erythroexchange (EEX) transfusions, both patients suffered from major sickle cell disease-related events, suggesting that EEX transfusions may not be enough to impact on advanced liver involvement by sickle cell disease.
28657766	A suspected delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction mediated by anti-Joa.	CONCLUSIONS: A 32-year-old African-American woman with a history of sickle cell disease presented for surgical evaluation of left total hip arthroplasty due to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. In anticipation of a complex orthopedic procedure, pre-surgical blood work was ordered. The patient's Fenwal blood sample typed as group O, D+. Although the patient had a history of anti-Fya, the antibody identification was inconclusive, so the workup was sent to a reference laboratory. The patient was last transfused with red blood cells (RBCs) 2 years earlier, but had no history of transfusion reactions. Due to surgery, the patient's hemoglobin (Hb) decreased from 10.2 g/dL (preoperative) to 8.6 g/dL (postoperative). One unit of weakly crossmatch-incompatible Fy(a-), C-, E-, K-, and sickle cell hemoglobin S (HbS)-negative RBCs was transfused without incident, and the patient was discharged. Several days later, the reference lab reported two new specificities, anti-Joa and anti-Jkb. Fortunately, the transfused RBC unit was Jk(b-). Therefore, the crossmatch incompatibility was attributed to anti-Joa, which targets a high-prevalence antigen found in 100 percent of most populations. Two weeks after discharge, the patient returned in sickle vaso-occlusive pain crisis. The patient was clinically stable, but her Hb was 6.7 g/dL. One unit of Fy(a-), Jk(b-), C-, E-, K-, HbS- RBCs, which was weakly crossmatch-incompatible, was transfused. The following day, her Hb was unchanged, lactic acid dehydrogenase increased from 951 to 2464 U/L, potassium increased from 3.7 to 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine increased from 0.60 to 0.98 mg/dL, and the patient developed a 38.4 C fever. These findings are consistent with a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR), mediated by anti-Joa, occurring 2 weeks after the first RBC transfusion. Further care could not be provided because the patient left the hospital against medical advice. The purpose of this case study is to report findings consistent with a DHTR attributed to anti-Joa, an antibody with relatively unknown clinical significance.
30725050	[Delayed hemolytic reaction to transfusion in sickle cell anemia. Report of one case].	Sickle cell anemia was a rare disease in Chile, especially in adults, however the recent immigration wave from Haiti is changing this scenario. We report a 29 year old black female from Haiti with a non-disclosed history of sickle cell anemia. She was transfused with two units of red blood cells, found unconscious and with jaundice five days later and admitted to the hospital. On admission she had a hemoglobin of 3.3 g/dL, a total bilirubin of 5.08 mg/dL, a LDH of 1,306 Ui/L. She was transfused again, worsening her condition. An alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic reaction was suspected. A direct Coombs test was positive. She was treated with steroids and her serum hemoglobin rose progressively.
34234298	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reverses white matter injury measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in sickle cell disease patients.	Brain injury in sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a wide spectrum of neurological damage. Neurocognitive deficits have been described even without established neurological lesions. DTI is a rapid, noninvasive, and non-contrast method that enables detection of normal-appearing white matter lesions not detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to evaluate if stem cell transplantation can revert white matter lesions in patients with SCD. Twenty-eight SCD patients were evaluated with MRI and DTI before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with 26 healthy controls (HC). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity maps, global efficiency, path length, and clustering coefficients. Compared to HC, SCD patients had a lower FA (p = 0.0086) before HSCT. After HSCT, FA increased and was not different from healthy controls (p = 0.1769). Mean MD, RD, and AD decreased after HSCT (p = 0.0049; p = 0.0029; p = 0.0408, respectively). We confirm previous data of white matter lesions in SCD and present evidence that HSCT promotes recovery of brain injury with potential improvement of brain structural connectivity.
38684631	Cost-Effectiveness of Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (Lovo-Cel) Gene Therapy for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Recurrent Vaso-Occlusive Events in the United States.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gene therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) may offer meaningful benefits for patients and society. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), a one-time gene therapy administered via autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, compared with common care for patients in the United States (US) with SCD aged >= 12 years with >= 4 vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) in the past 24 months. METHODS: We developed a patient-level simulation model accounting for lovo-cel and SCD-related events, complications, and mortality over a lifetime time horizon. The pivotal phase 1/2 HGB-206 clinical trial (NCT02140554) served as the basis for lovo-cel efficacy and safety. Cost, quality-of-life, and other clinical data were sourced from HGB-206 data and the literature. Analyses were conducted from US societal and third-party payer perspectives. Uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis and extensive scenario analyses. RESULTS: Patients treated with lovo-cel were predicted to survive 23.84 years longer on average (standard deviation [SD], 12.80) versus common care (life expectancy, 62.24 versus 38.40 years), with associated discounted patient quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of 10.20 (SD, 4.10) and direct costs avoided of $1,329,201 (SD, $1,346,446) per patient. Predicted societal benefits included discounted caregiver QALY losses avoided of 1.19 (SD, 1.38) and indirect costs avoided of $540,416 (SD, $262,353) per patient. Including lovo-cel costs ($3,282,009 [SD, $29,690] per patient) resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $191,519 and $124,051 per QALY gained from third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. In scenario analyses, the predicted cost-effectiveness of lovo-cel also was sensitive to baseline age and VOE frequency and to the proportion of patients achieving and maintaining complete resolution of VOEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of lovo-cel gene therapy compared with common care for patients in the US with SCD with recurrent VOEs estimated meaningful improvements in survival, quality of life, and other clinical outcomes accompanied by increased overall costs for the health care system and for broader society. The predicted economic value of lovo-cel gene therapy was influenced by uncertainty in long-term clinical effects and by positive spillover effects on patient productivity and caregiver burden.
31203715	Severe hypersensitivity allergic reaction to filgrastim in a healthy stem cell donor.	INTRODUCTION: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been approved for use for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the marrow into the blood for peripheral blood stem cell collection. Commonly reported side effects of G-CSF include deep throbbing bone pain, severe myalgia and leucocytosis. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of severe hypersensitivity anaphylactoid reaction after filgrastim administration in a healthy stem cell donor. This haploidentical donor was a 38-year old man with sickle cell trait, donating stem cells for his son, a case of sickle cell disease. On administration of G-CSF (10 microg/kg) he developed features of anaphylaxis. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: He was given supportive care with oxygen, IV fluid bolus, anti histaminics and steroids. The donor had complete recovery and underwent successful bone marrow harvest. CONCLUSION: There have been various reports of hypersensitivity anaphylactoid reactions in patients undergoing chemotherapy but those associated with the first dose of G-CSF in healthy stem cell donors have rarely been reported.
36067800	Diverse Approaches to Gene Therapy of Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.

32892996	Adherence to Iron Chelation Therapy with Deferasirox Formulations among Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and beta-thalassemia.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with hemoglobinopathies experience complications that often require management with multiple transfusions. These chronic transfusions can lead to iron overload, which places them at increased risk of organ damage, malignancy, and even death. Deferasirox is the most common iron chelator used to treat iron overload due to its safety, efficacy, and oral administration. The first formulation of deferasirox, a dispersible tablet for oral suspension (DT) called Exjade , was associated with adherence challenges due to complaints from poor taste and side effects such as abdominal discomfort. A new film-coated tablet formulation (FCT) called Jadenu  was subsequently developed to overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare adherence rates between formulations of deferasirox (DT versus FCT) and describe associations between adherence to chelation therapy and changes in hematological parameters among patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia. METHODS: In this retrospective study of 20 children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia with iron overload, we compared adherence rates for deferasirox DT versus deferasirox FCT. We reviewed data from the electronic medical record and pharmacy expense reports between 2014 and 2018. We calculated the mean medication possession ratio (MPR) and analyzed the mean paired difference in MPR and ferritin levels using paired sample t-test. RESULTS: The overall mean MPR was 0.15 (0.25) for deferasirox DT and 0.44 (0.32) for deferasirox FCT. The mean paired difference in MPR when transitioning from deferasirox DT to deferasirox FCT was +0.29, p-value < 0.01 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.39). The mean paired difference in ferritin while on deferasirox DT compared to ferritin 6 months after transitioning to deferasirox FCT was -306 ng/mL p-value = 0.14 (95% CI: 719, 113). CONCLUSION: There was significant improvement in adherence to iron chelation therapy when patients transitioned from deferasirox DT to deferasirox FCT.

34224261	Treatment of Acute Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in an Infusion Center Versus the Emergency Department : A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Infusion centers (ICs) are alternatives to emergency department (ED) care and may improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether care in ICs or EDs leads to better outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated VOCs. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02411396). SETTING: 4 U.S. sites, with recruitment between April 2015 and December 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with SCD living within 60 miles of a study site. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were followed for 18 months after enrollment. Outcomes of interest were time to first dose of parenteral pain medication, whether pain reassessment was completed within 30 minutes after the first dose, and patient disposition on discharge from the acute care visit. Treatment effects for ICs versus EDs were estimated using a time-varying propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: Researchers enrolled 483 participants; the 269 who had acute care visits on weekdays are included in this report. With inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment, the mean time to first dose was 62 minutes in ICs and 132 minutes in EDs; the difference was 70 minutes (95% CI, 54 to 98 minutes; E-value, 2.8). The probability of pain reassessment within 30 minutes of the first dose of parenteral pain medication was 3.8 times greater (CI, 2.63 to 5.64 times greater; E-value, 4.7) in the IC than the ED. The probability that a participant's visit would end in admission to the hospital was smaller by a factor of 4 (0.25 [CI, 0.18 to 0.33]) with treatment in an IC versus an ED. LIMITATION: The study was restricted to participants with uncomplicated VOCs. CONCLUSION: In adults with SCD having a VOC, treatment in an IC is associated with substantially better outcomes than treatment in an ED.

We present here the first published use of letermovir for the treatment of resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a pediatric patient. A 14-year-old girl underwent a double unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation to treat her sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS) and developed ganciclovir-resistant CMV DNAemia with end-organ involvement that was treated successfully with a combination of foscarnet and letermovir. After she was transitioned to letermovir monotherapy for secondary prophylaxis, she developed recurrent DNAemia with laboratory-confirmed ganciclovir, foscarnet, and letermovir resistance.
29859773	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: An update.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common life-threatening monogenic diseases affecting millions of people worldwide. Allogenic hematopietic stem cell transplantation is the only known cure for the disease with high success rates, but the limited availability of matched sibling donors and the high risk of transplantation-related side effects force the scientific community to envision additional therapies. Ex vivo gene therapy through globin gene addition has been investigated extensively and is currently being tested in clinical trials that have begun reporting encouraging data. Recent improvements in our understanding of the molecular pathways controlling mammalian erythropoiesis and globin switching offer new and exciting therapeutic options. Rapid and substantial advances in genome engineering tools, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, have raised the possibility of genetic correction in induced pluripotent stem cells as well as patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, these techniques are still in their infancy, and safety/efficacy issues remain that must be addressed before translating these promising techniques into clinical practice.
31985807	American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: transfusion support.	BACKGROUND: Red cell transfusions remain a mainstay of therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but pose significant clinical challenges. Guidance for specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload may improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about transfusion support for SCD and the management of transfusion-related complications. METHODS: The American Society of Hematology formed a multidisciplinary panel that was balanced to minimize bias from conflicts of interest and that included a patient representative. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to form recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel developed 10 recommendations focused on red cell antigen typing and matching, indications, and mode of administration (simple vs red cell exchange), as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, DHTRs, and iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of panel recommendations were conditional due to the paucity of direct, high-certainty evidence for outcomes of interest. Research priorities were identified, including prospective studies to understand the role of serologic vs genotypic red cell matching, the mechanism of HTRs resulting from specific alloantigens to inform therapy, the role and timing of regular transfusions during pregnancy for women, and the optimal treatment of transfusional iron overload in SCD.
32878859	Long-term oxygen therapy in children with sickle cell disease and hypoxaemia.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and safety profile of nocturnal long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and chronic hypoxaemia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS, SETTING AND INTERVENTION: Children with SCD who started LTOT from 2014 to early 2019 in two tertiary hospitals in London, UK were retrospectively enrolled. Patients who started disease-modifying therapies <12 months before LTOT or while on LTOT were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minor and major adverse events during LTOT were reported. Laboratory and clinical data, transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans and overnight oximetry studies performed at steady state within 12 months before and after starting LTOT were compared. RESULTS: Nineteen children (10 males; median age 12 years, range 6-15) were included. Nearly half of them (9/19; 47%) were on hydroxyurea at baseline. No child discontinued LTOT because of intolerance or poor adherence. No major adverse events were reported. Laboratory data did not show significant changes in haemoglobin and reticulocyte count after 1 year of follow-up. No statistically significant change in the incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events was noted (median annual rate from 0.5 to 0 episode per patient/year; p=0.062). Overnight oximetry tests performed while on LTOT showed improvements in all oxygen saturation parameters (mean overnight and nadir SpO2, % of time spent with SpO2 <90%) compared with the baseline. CONCLUSION: LTOT is a safe and feasible treatment option for children with SCD and chronic hypoxaemia.

35588309	Hyperhemolysis in a patient with sickle cell disease and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, with complex auto- and alloantibody work-up, successfully treated with tocilizumab.	BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction seen in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, characterized by destruction of donor and recipient RBCs. It results in a drop in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels and frequently reticulocytopenia. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a man in his thirties with SCD with a recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior for COVID-19. His red cell antibody history included anti-Fy(a) and warm autoantibody. At that time, he was given 2 units of RBC and discharged with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl. He returned to the hospital approximately 1.5 weeks later with hemoglobin 6.0 g/dl and symptoms concerning for acute chest syndrome. Pretransfusion testing now showed 4+ pan-agglutinin in both gel-based and tube-based testing. Alloadsorption identified an anti-N and a strong cold agglutinin. Three least incompatible units were transfused to this patient over several days, with evidence of hemolysis. Further reference lab work revealed anti-Fya , anti-Fyb , anti-Lea , anti-Leb , and an anti-KN system antibody. The patient's hemoglobin nadired at 4.4 g/dl. The patient was treated with a single dose of tocilizumab, his hemoglobin stabilized, and he was discharged. DISCUSSION: We present a case of HHS proximate to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with multiple allo and autoantibodies identified. Information on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HHS is limited; however, it is possible that inflammation related to COVID-19 could predispose to HHS. Tocilizumab is an approved treatment for COVID-19. Additionally, tocilizumab appears to be a promising treatment option for patients with HHS.
28673501	Management of iron overload in hemoglobinopathies.	Hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most frequent monogenic diseases in the world. Transfusion has improved dramatically their prognosis, but provokes iron overload, which induces multiple organ damages. Iron overload is related to accumulation of iron released from hemolysis and transfused red cell, but also, in thalassemic patients, secondary to ineffective erythropoiesis, which increases intestinal iron absorption via decreased hepcidin production. Transfusion-related cardiac iron overload remains a main cause of death in thalassemia in well-resourced countries, and is responsible for severe hepatic damages in sickle cell disease. Regular monitoring by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using myocardial T2* (ms) and Liver Iron Content (LIC) (mg of iron/g dry weight) are now standards of care in chronically transfused patients. Serum ferritin level measurements and record of the total number of transfused erythrocyte concentrates are also helpful tools. Three iron chelators are currently available, deferoxamine, which must be injected subcutaneously or intravenously, and two oral chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox. We will review the main characteristics of these drugs and their indications.
30893088	Pain and sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment but remain suboptimal. We discuss mechanism-based treatable targets devoid of opioids to prevent and/or treat SCD pain. RECENT FINDINGS: Understanding the pathogenesis of pain is critical to develop targeted therapies. Nevertheless, acute and chronic pain can have independent and/or overlapping mechanisms. The origin of pain involves neurovascular and neuroimmune interactions from the periphery and/or central nervous system. Immunomodulatory components of acute and/or chronic sickle pain for targeting/preventing pain genesis include mast cell and microglial activation, neurogenic inflammation, and leukocyte-derived elastase. Vascular modulators include hypoxia/reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, hemolysis, and adhesion molecules. However, existent pain requires analgesics devoid of an inadvertent effect on sickle pathobiology. Recent analgesic targets include cannabinoid and nociceptin receptors and serotonergic spinothalamic pathway. Complementary approaches (e.g., acupuncture, hypnosis, perception-based therapies) have shown analgesic potential. Owing to heterogeneity in pain development, it remains challenging to combat SCD pain with any one therapy. SUMMARY: SCD pain involves neuroimmune and neurovascular interactions. Such interactions have pronociceptive impacts and impart therapy resistance. Elucidating molecular and cellular entities affecting neuronal interactions in sickle microenvironment may prevent SCD pain and/or provide improved analgesic approaches.
29537064	Preconception risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease.	BACKGROUND: Globally, about five per cent of children are born with congenital or genetic disorders. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in specific patient populations. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if genetic counselling is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials.Date of latest search of the registers: 20 June 2017.Date of latest search of all other sources: 16 November 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified 25 papers, describing 16 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were included. One ongoing trial has been identified which may potentially eligible for inclusion once completed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease were found for inclusion in this review, the research evidence for current policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies.Information from well-designed, adequately powered, randomised trials is desirable in order to make more robust recommendations for practice. However, such trials must also consider the legal, ethical, and cultural barriers to implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment.
34889383	Optimizing management of sickle cell disease in patients undergoing surgery.	Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are likely to be referred for surgery at some point in their lifetime due to a high incidence of musculoskeletal and intrabdominal complications such as avascular necrosis and gallbladder disease. Preoperative optimization is a multidisciplinary process that involves a hematologist with SCD expertise, an anesthesiologist, and the surgical team. The type and risk classification of the surgery, disease severity, medications, baseline hemoglobin, transfusion history, and history of prior surgical complications are often documented. Clinicians should consider perioperative risk assessment that includes determining the patient's functional status and cardiovascular risk and screening for obstructive sleep apnea. Many patients will require preoperative transfusion to reduce the risk of postoperative complications such as acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive pain crises. The hematologist should consider the patient's preoperative transfusion requirements and ensure that the surgical team has an appropriate plan for postoperative observation and management. This often includes follow-up laboratory studies, a postoperative pain management plan, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The transfusion plan should be patient-specific and take into account the SCD genotype, baseline hemoglobin, disease severity, risk classification of the surgery, and history of prior surgical complications. In the intraoperative and postoperative period, dehydration, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis should be avoided, and incentive spirometry should be utilized to minimize complications such as acute chest syndrome. In this review we discuss preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies to optimize patients with SCD undergoing surgery.
34879990	Curative therapy for hemoglobinopathies: an International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy Stem Cell Engineering Committee review comparing outcomes, accessibility and cost of ex vivo stem cell gene therapy versus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and represent a growing global health burden. Management is limited by a paucity of disease-modifying therapies; however, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and autologous HSCT after genetic modification offer patients a curative option. Allogeneic HSCT is limited by donor selection, morbidity and mortality from transplant conditioning, graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection, whereas significant concerns regarding long-term safety, efficacy and cost limit the broad applicability of gene therapy. Here the authors review current outcomes in allogeneic and autologous HSCT for transfusion-dependent thalassemia and SCD and provide our perspective on issues surrounding accessibility and costs as barriers to offering curative therapy to patients with hereditary hemoglobinopathies.

29023896	Predicting changes in hemoglobin S after simple transfusion using complete blood counts.	BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin S percentages are used in the management of patients who have sickle cell disease. However, hemoglobin S measurements often are not routinely or rapidly performed. Rapid and accurate methods to estimate hemoglobin S levels after simple transfusion may improve the care of patients with sickle cell disease. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the electronic medical record identified 24 stable patients with sickle cell disease who received simple red blood cell transfusions and had hemoglobin S measurements before and after the transfusion that were less than 72 hours apart. Examination of these patients identified 62 separate transfusions that met our criteria. Three simple equations that utilized complete blood count values and readily available information from the medical record were used to predict the post-transfusion hemoglobin S level after transfusion (Equation 1: predicted post-transfusion hemoglobin = pre-transfusion hemoglobin S x [pre-transfusion hemoglobin/post-transfusion hemoglobin]; Equation 2: predicted post-transfusion hemoglobin S = pre-transfusion hemoglobin S x [pre-transfusion hematocrit/post-transfusion hematocrit]; and Equation 3: predicted post-transfusion hemoglobin S = pre-transfusion hemoglobin S x total pre-transfusion hemoglobin/[total pre-transfusion hemoglobin + (red blood cell volume x 20)]). RESULTS: The predicted hemoglobin S values for all three equations showed a highly significant correlation with the measured post-hemoglobin S value. The coefficient of determination (R2 ) for Equations 1, 2, and 3 was 0.95, 0.92, and 0.97, respectively. Predicting the post-transfusion hemoglobin S value using estimates of the patient's total hemoglobin and the transfused hemoglobin (Equation 3) was the most precise. CONCLUSION: Reductions in hemoglobin S values in patients with sickle cell disease who receive simple red blood cell transfusions can be reliably predicted using complete blood cell measurements and simple arithmetic equations.
32705357	Neuropathic Pain and Sickle Cell Disease: a Review of Pharmacologic Management.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains among the most common and severe monogenic disorders present in the world today. Although sickle cell pain has been traditionally characterized as nociceptive, a significant portion of sickle cell patients has reported neuropathic pain symptoms. Our review article will discuss clinical aspects of SCD-related neuropathic pain, epidemiology of neuropathic pain among individuals with SCD, pain mechanisms, and current and future potential pharmacological interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Neuropathic pain in SCD is a complicated condition that often has a lifelong and significant negative impact on life; therefore, improved pain management is considered a significant and unmet need. Neuropathic pain mechanisms are heterogeneous, and the difficulty in determining their individual contribution to specific pain types may contribute to poor treatment outcomes in this population. Our review article outlines several pharmacological modalities which may be employed to treat neuropathic pain in SCD patients.
30571829	[Sickle cell disease: A diagnosis to keep in mind].	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is the most frequent structural hemoglobinopathy worldwide, and it is produced by an alteration in the globin chain genes. In Chile, there is no data on the prevalence of SCD since it is considered a very rare condition. The incidence of this disease has been increasing due to migration of people from areas with greater presence of SCD. It is important to know and consider this diagnosis in a selected group of patients with anemia, in order to prevent and treat the different complications of this disease. This article reviews the most recent information that shows new concepts in the knowledge of the physiopathology, and especially publications of guidelines and consensus in relation to the diagnosis and management of this con dition.
35114690	Quantitative analysis of mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccination response in immunocompromised adult hematology patients.	Vaccination guidelines for patients treated for hematological diseases are typically conservative. Given their high risk for severe COVID-19, it is important to identify those patients that benefit from vaccination. We prospectively quantified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to spike subunit 1 (S1) antigens during and after 2-dose mRNA-1273 (Spikevax/Moderna) vaccination in hematology patients. Obtaining S1 IgG >= 300 binding antibody units (BAUs)/mL was considered adequate as it represents the lower level of S1 IgG concentration obtained in healthy individuals, and it correlates with potent virus neutralization. Selected patients (n = 723) were severely immunocompromised owing to their disease or treatment thereof. Nevertheless, >50% of patients obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL after 2-dose mRNA-1273. All patients with sickle cell disease or chronic myeloid leukemia obtained adequate antibody concentrations. Around 70% of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), multiple myeloma, or untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Ruxolitinib or hypomethylating therapy but not high-dose chemotherapy blunted responses in myeloid malignancies. Responses in patients with lymphoma, patients with CLL on ibrutinib, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell recipients were low. The minimal time interval after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to reach adequate concentrations was <2 months for multiple myeloma, 8 months for lymphoma, and 4 to 6 months after allogeneic HCT. Serum IgG4, absolute B- and natural killer-cell number, and number of immunosuppressants predicted S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Hematology patients on chemotherapy, shortly after HCT, or with cGVHD should not be precluded from vaccination. This trial was registered at Netherlands Trial Register as #NL9553.

29577801	Early Identification of Barriers and Facilitators to Self-Management Behaviors in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease to Minimize Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Complications.	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an elective, curative treatment option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Transplant requires extensive self-management behaviors to be successful. The purpose of this study was to describe potential barriers and facilitators to self-management in a group of pediatric patients with SCD prior to HCT and their medical outcomes post-HCT. A multiple case study approach was used to describe 4 pairs of transplant recipients grouped by age, donor type, and donor source. Each pair included a case with minimal and increased post-HCT complications. Complications included readmissions, graft-versus-host disease, systemic infections, and survival in the first year post-HCT. Variables were retrospectively collected and content analyzed to identify barriers and facilitators within and across pairs using existing self-management frameworks. While higher risk transplants experienced more complications, 3 of the 4 cases with increased complications had a larger number of modifiable barriers identified compared with those experiencing minimal complications. At least one modifiable barrier and multiple facilitators were identified in all cases. A standardized psychosocial assessment process with an established plan to mitigate barriers and promote facilitators to self-management is essential to optimize outcomes in patients with SCD undergoing elective HCT.
33735176	Descriptive analysis of sickle cell patients living in France: The PHEDRE cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) induces chronic haemolytic anaemia and intermittent vaso-occlusion that results in tissue ischaemia causing acute, severe pain episodes that can lead to frequent hospitalizations. These consequences can have repercussions on family, social, school and/or professional life. Here, we present some of the results of the PHEDRE study (Pharmacodependance Et DREpanocytose-drug dependence and sickle-cell disease), which is the largest study of patients with SCD in France. This paper intends to describe characteristics of the French SCD population. We also aimed to assess the impact of the disease on the lives of patients using objective and subjective variables. METHODS: The PHEDRE study was a national multicentric observational study. Adults, adolescents and children with a confirmed SCD diagnosis were included in the study by their referring doctor. Then, they were interviewed by phone about their socioeconomic status, about the impact of the disease on their lives and about their analgesic and psychoactive drug use. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 872 patients (28% were minors). Seventy-two percent of adults were active, and all minors were in school. Many patients presented criteria of severe SCD. Seventy-five percent were homozygous SS, 15% were double heterozygotes SC and 8% were heterozygotes Sbetathal, 87% received specific treatment, 58% were hospitalized at least once for vaso-occlusive crisis in the past 12 months, and the number of analgesic drugs taken averaged 3.8. Seventy-five percent of patients reported academic or professional consequences related to their SCD, and 52% reported social consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of SCD on patients' lives can be significant, nevertheless their social integration seems to be maintained. We highlighted respect of recommendations regarding analgesic treatments and only a few patients used tobacco, alcohol or cannabis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials, NCT02580565; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ Registered 16 October 2015.
36043959	Blood transfusion and iron overload in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): Personal experience and a short update of diabetes mellitus occurrence.	The conventional treatment of beta-thalassemia (beta-TM) patients is based on the correction of anemia through regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy. However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only currently available technique that has curative potential. Variable frequency and severity of long-term growth and endocrine changes after conventional treatment as well as after HSCT have been reported by different centers. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize and update knowledge about long-term growth and endocrine changes after HSCT in patients with beta-TM in comparison to those occurring in beta-TM patients on conventional treatment. Regular surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in a multi-disciplinary specialized setting are suggested to optimize the patient's quality of life (www.actabiomedica.it).
34786823	Use of infusion ports in patients with sickle cell disease: Indications and complications.	BACKGROUND: Peripheral venous access in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can become difficult over time due to frequent access and scarring. Infusion ports provide reliable central venous access. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and infections are complications associated with SCD and infusion ports. METHODS: We performed a 17.5-year single-institution retrospective chart review (January 2000 to July 2018) with literature review regarding use of infusion ports in patients with SCD. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients with infusion ports placed for a total of 63 devices (48 for chronic transfusion [CT] and 15 for poor venous access [PVA], not on CT) for a total of 99,272 catheter days. The mean age at first insertion was 8 years (range 1-20 years). Complications included malfunction, infection, thrombosis, difficult access, and pain over infusion port site. The rate of infection was 0.2 per 1000 catheter days. Thrombosis was identified in three devices (5%) in three patients (9%), with a rate of 0.03 per 1000 catheter days. There was no difference in complications by site in either the left or right subclavian vein (p = 1). The rate of premature removal was 0.36 per 1000 catheter days, which was higher among patients with infusion ports solely for PVA (0.87 per 1000 catheter days) compared with those placed for CT (0.29 per 1000 catheter days). CONCLUSION: Infusion ports in patients with SCD was associated with low rates of thrombosis, infection, and malfunction, and may be considered as an alternative to frequent intravenous access, especially in patients requiring CT.
28441316	Hemolysis Following Intraoperative Cell Salvage Replacement in a Scoliosis Patient With Sickle Cell Trait: A Case Report.	MINI: Intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) is used to reduce blood loss in scoliosis spinal fusion. We report one case of hemolysis induced acute renal failure following ICS. This is the first reported case of acute renal failure associated with hemolysis following ICS in a scoliosis patient with sickle cell trait. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel presentation of acute renal failure associated with hemolysis after intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) in a neuromuscular scoliosis patient with sickle cell trait (SCT). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Hemolysis-associated acute renal failure after ICS in patients with SCT has not been previously reported. Sickle cell disease is regarded as a relative contraindication for ICS due to the risk of red blood cell sickling in the hypoxic cell saver reservoir. A previous case series demonstrated successful ICS reinfusion after elective caesarean section in two patients with SCT. However, a decision to not reinfuse ICS collected blood due to increased sickling after blood processing was reported in general surgery. METHODS: A 14-year-old female with Group I neuromuscular scoliosis underwent a navigated T3-S1posterior spinal instrumentation fusion. Three hundred milliliters of blood collected by ICS was reinfused intraoperatively along with two units of packed red blood cells. RESULTS: Postoperatively, the patient had delayed emergence from the general anesthetic and gross hematuria was observed in the urinary catheter bag. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was treated successfully for hemolysis-induced renal failure. CONCLUSION: Given the potential seriousness of hemolysis-associated acute renal failure associated with ICS, we recommend against the use of ICS in patients with SCT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.
33504459	Complement in sickle cell disease and targeted therapy: I know one thing, that I know nothing.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited clinical syndrome, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. Anemia, susceptibility to infections and episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are among its features. Since SCD complications (VOC or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction/DHTR) lead to significant morbidity and mortality, a number of studies have addressed their pathophysiology Although SCD pathophysiology has been mainly attributed to the interaction between sickle cells and neutrophils, platelets or endothelial cells in small vessels leading to hemolysis, the role of complement activation has been increasingly investigated. Importantly, complement inhibition with eculizumab has shown beneficial effects in DHTR. Given the unmet clinical need of novel therapeutics in SCD, our review summarizes current understanding of (a) complement system for the clinician, (b) complement activation in SCD both in asymptomatic state and severe clinical manifestations, (c) probable underlying mechanisms of complement activation in SCD, and (d) new therapeutic perspective of complement inhibition.
31489983	Ischemic stroke in children and young adults with sickle cell disease in the post-STOP era.	"The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) and Optimizing Primary Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP 2) trials established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening, with indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) for children with abnormal TCD as standard of care. Implementation failures and limitations to the STOP protocol may contribute to continued ischemic stroke occurrence. In the ""Post-STOP"" study, we sought to assess the impact of the STOP protocol on the incidence of ischemic stroke in a multicenter cohort of former STOP and/or STOP 2 trial participants. A central team abstracted data for 2851 (74%) of the 3835 children who took part in STOP and/or STOP 2. Data included TCD and neuroimaging results, treatment, laboratory data, and detailed clinical information pertaining to the stroke. Two stroke neurologists independently confirmed each stroke using pre-specified imaging and clinical criteria and came to consensus. Among the 2808 patients who were stroke-free at the start of Post-STOP with available follow-up, the incidence of first ischemic stroke was 0.24 per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 0.18, 0.31), with a mean (SD) duration of follow-up of 9.1 (3.4) [median 10.3, range (0-15.4)] years. Most (63%) strokes occurred in patients in whom the STOP protocol had not been properly implemented, either failure to screen appropriately with TCD (38%) or failure to transfuse adequately patients with abnormal TCD (25%). This study shows that substantial opportunities for ischemic stroke prevention remain by more complete implementation of the STOP Protocol."
33674866	Pain Experiences of Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Qualitative Study.	OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about pain management experiences throughout this process. The objective of this study was to explore patients' experiences with pain and pain management during and after HSCT for SCD. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with 10 patients who underwent HSCT for SCD. We transcribed interviews verbatim and inductively identified codes. We used thematic analysis alongside a constant comparative method to develop and refine a codebook that aided in the identification of themes. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged. (1) The pain trajectory: patients described a fluctuating course of pain during HSCT, which often extended long afterwards and impacted all aspects of life, particularly affected by pre-HSCT experiences; (2) The role of opioids-a double-edged sword: patients described opioids as reducing pain but insufficiently to balance significant adverse effects and burden; (3) Patient-centered decision making in pain management: patients described insufficient agency in decisions about opioid use and weaning; and (4) Consequences of health-related stigma: patients described experiences with stigma, mainly related to opioid use and weaning, as similar to pre-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of patients who have undergone HSCT for SCD, clinicians should use a patient-centered approach, integrating non-opioid approaches into pain management, particularly psychosocial support. As transplant for SCD becomes increasingly available, incorporating patient perspectives may improve health care delivery and overall patient experiences.
29076161	Use of the blood substitute HBOC-201 in critically ill patients during sickle crisis: a three-case series.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an important treatment modality during severe sickle cell crisis (SCC). SCC patients who refuse, or cannot accept, RBCs present a unique challenge. Acellular hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) might be an alternative for critically ill patients in SCC with multiorgan failure due to life-threatening anemia. HBOC-201 (HbO2 Therapeutics) has been administered to more than 800 anemic patients in 22 clinical trials, but use of any HBOCs in critically ill sickle cell patients with organ failure is exceedingly rare. In the United States, HBOC-201 is currently only available for expanded access. CASE REPORT: We report three cases of HBOC-201 administered to critically ill sickle cell disease patients in SCC with multiorgan failure, either who refused RBCs (Jehovah's Witnesses) or for whom compatible RBCs were not available. RESULTS: Two patients received more than 20 units of HBOC-201, while the other received 6. The 27 units used in the third case equals the largest volume a patient has successfully received to date. All three patients survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: These reports suggest that blood substitutes such as HBOC-201 can provide an oxygen bridge in SCC with multiorgan failure, until corpuscular Hb levels recover to meet metabolic demand, and highlight the compelling biochemical properties that warrant further investigation.
35360062	Testicular Tissue Banking for Fertility Preservation in Young Boys: Which Patients Should Be Included?	Due to the growing number of young patients at risk of germ cell loss, there is a need to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for patients who are not able to bank spermatozoa. Worldwide, more and more clinics are implementing testicular tissue (TT) banking programs, making it a novel, yet indispensable, discipline in the field of fertility preservation. Previously, TT cryopreservation was predominantly offered to young cancer patients before starting gonadotoxic chemo- or radiotherapy. Nowadays, most centers also bank TT from patients with non-malignant conditions who need gonadotoxic conditioning therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Additionally, some centers include patients who suffer from genetic or developmental disorders associated with prepubertal germ cell loss or patients who already had a previous round of chemo- or radiotherapy. It is important to note that the surgical removal of TT is an invasive procedure. Moreover, TT cryopreservation is still considered experimental as restoration methods are not yet clinically available. For this reason, TT banking should preferably only be offered to patients who are at significant risk of becoming infertile. In our view, TT cryopreservation is recommended for young cancer patients in need of high-risk chemo- and/or radiotherapy, regardless of previous low-risk treatment. Likewise, TT banking is advised for patients with non-malignant disorders such as sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and bone marrow failure, who need high-risk conditioning therapy before HSCT/BMT. TT retrieval during orchidopexy is also proposed for patients with bilateral cryptorchidism. Since patients with a medium- to low-risk treatment generally maintain their fertility, TT banking is not advised for this group. Also for Klinefelter patients, TT banking is not recommended as it does not give better outcomes than a testicular sperm extraction later in life.

29047145	A randomized controlled trial comparing two vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) protocols in sickle cell disease (SCD).	Limited evidence guides opioid dosing strategies for acute Sickle Cell (SCD) pain. We compared two National Heart, Lung and Blood (NHBLI) recommended opioid dosing strategies (weight-based vs. patient-specific) for ED treatment of acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE). A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in two ED's. Adults >= 21 years of age with SCD disease were eligible. Among the 155 eligible patients, 106 consented and 52 had eligible visits. Patients were pre-enrolled in the outpatient setting and randomized to one of two opioid dosing strategies for a future ED visit. ED providers accessed protocols through the electronic medical record. Change in pain score (0-100 mm VAS) from arrival to ED disposition, as well as side effects were assessed. 52 patients (median age was 27 years, 42% were female, and 89% black) had one or more ED visits for a VOE (total of 126 ED study visits, up to 5 visits/patient were included). Participants randomized to the patient-specific protocol experienced a mean reduction in pain score that was 16.6 points greater than patients randomized to the weight-based group (mean difference 95% CI = 11.3 to 21.9, P = 0.03). Naloxone was not required for either protocol and nausea and/or vomiting was observed less often in the patient-specific protocol (25.8% vs 59.4%, P = 0.0001). The hospital admission rate for VOE was lower for patients in the patient-specific protocol (40.3% vs 57.8% P = 0.05). NHLBI guideline-based analgesia with patient-specific opioid dosing resulted in greater improvements in the pain experience compared to a weight-based strategy, without increased side effects.
30656488	Renal Medullary Carcinoma: a Report of the Current Literature.	PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: We present an updated report of renal medullary carcinoma (RMC), a rare and aggressive condition. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a majority of male patients, of African descent, in the second or third decade of life. In differential diagnosis, other tumors, such as malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), vinculin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (VCL-ALK) translocation renal cell carcinoma, and collecting duct carcinoma, may present difficulties. Abnormalities of tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 have been found in RMC. Reported symptoms were hematuria, pain, weight loss, respiratory distress, palpable mass, cough, and fever. Most patients present with metastases at diagnosis. There is no definite recommended treatment, and protocols are extrapolated from other malignancies, with nephrectomy and systemic therapies being most frequently used. Response to treatment and prognosis remain very poor. RMC is a rare and aggressive tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires histological assessment and the presence of sickle-cell hemoglobinopathies.
29898152	Aortic Valve Replacement Combined with Ascending Aortic Aneurysmectomy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease: a Case Report.	Sickle cell anemia is a haematological disorder characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive complications, resulting in a reduced life expectancy. These patients are exposed to several triggering factors for sickle cell crises when they are submitted to cardiovascular surgeries with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore, meticulous care and perioperative management are required. This paper reports a successful case of combined cardiovascular surgery - aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysmectomy - with no serious post-operative complications. In this report, we emphasize the peculiarities of perioperative care in patients with sickle cell anemia.
32790687	Outcomes following kidney transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: The impact of automated exchange blood transfusion.	There are over 12,000 people with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the UK, and 4-12% of patients who develop Sickle Cell Nephropathy (SCN) progress to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Renal transplantation offers the best outcomes for these patients with but their access to transplantation is often limited. Regular automated exchange blood transfusions (EBT) reduce the complications of SCD and may improve outcomes. However, concerns over alloimmunisation limit its widespread implementation. In this retrospective multicenter study, data were collected on 34 SCD patients who received a kidney transplant across 6 London Hospitals between 1997 and 2017. 20/34 patients were on an EBT program, pre or post renal transplantation. Overall patient and graft survival were inferior to contemporaneous UK data in the ESRD population as a whole, a finding which is well-recognised. However, patient survival (CI 95%, p = 0.0032), graft survival and graft function were superior at all time-points in those who received EBT versus those who did not. 4/20 patients (20%) on EBT developed de novo donor specific antibodies (DSAs). 3/14 patients (21%) not on EBT developed de novo DSAs. The incidence of rejection in those on EBT was 5/18 (28%), as compared with 7/13 (54%) not on EBT. In conclusion, our data, while limited by an inevitably small sample size and differences in the date of transplantation, do suggest that long-term automated EBT post renal transplant is effective and safe, with improvement in graft and patient outcomes and no increase in antibody formation or graft rejection.

30914240	Red blood cell exchange in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.	Automatic red blood cell exchange i.e. using devices (RBCX) has become a standard therapy to remove abnormal red blood cells (RBC) in adults and children affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). This treatment is performed both in emergency to treat acute complications and through a regular program of RBCX to prevent the recurrence of complications. However, small children, i.e. those with a low body weight, height and total blood volume, are at risk of relative hypovolemia and metabolic complications during the procedure. Moreover, the peripheral venous access is limited among young children, which requires alternative short- or long-term venous access. These two main limiting factors necessitate adaptations of the procedures and subsequent monitoring during and after the sessions. However, performing RBCX in children requires other adaptations and cautions that must be considered. Our review summarizes the limits, safety precautions and the adaptations of the techniques to ensure RBCX in children.
36240296	Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with stable donor engraftment after allogeneic HSCT generally do not experience SCD-related complications; however, there are no published data specifically reporting the change in vaso-occlusive events (VOE) after HSCT. Data regarding the number of VOEs requiring medical attention in the 2 years before allogeneic HSCT were compared with the number of VOEs in the 2 years (0-12 months and 12-24 months) after allogeneic HSCT in patients with SCD. One-hundred sixty-three patients with SCD underwent allogeneic HSCT between 2005 and 2019. The average age at the time of HSCT was 21 years (range, 7 months - 64 years). Most patients underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning (75% [N = 123]) and had a matched sibling donor (72% [N = 118]). The mean number of VOEs was reduced from 5.6 (range, 0-52) in the 2 years before HSCT to 0.9 (range, 0-12) in the 2 years after HSCT (P < .001). Among the post-HSCT events, VOE was more frequent during the first 12 months (0.8 [range, 0-12]) than at 12 to 24 months after HSCT (0.1 [range, 0-8) (P < .001)). In patients who had graft rejection (12%, N = 20), VOEs were reduced from 6.6 (range, 0-24) before HSCT to 1.1 (range, 0-6) and 0.8 (range, 0-8) at 0 to 12 months and 12 to 24 months after HSCT, respectively (P < .001). VOEs requiring medical care were significantly reduced after allogeneic HSCT for patients with SCD. These data will inform the development of novel autologous HSCT gene therapy approaches.
38010293	Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene therapy and gene editing.	A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and current treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for SCD.
34151636	Contemporary Management and Prevention of Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOCs) in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.	"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder that primarily affects individuals of African descent from sub-Saharan Africa and along the mediterranean. The main complications leading to hospitalizations include vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and acute chest syndrome (ACS). Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to identify and evaluate evidence-based management and prevention of VOCs in patients with SCD. A literature search of PubMed, Medline Cochrane and Google Scholar database (January 1985 to April 2020) was performed using the following search terms ""vaso-occlusive crises"", ""sickle cell disease"", ""hydroxyurea"", ""L-glutamine"", ""voxelotor"", ""crizanlizumab"", ""treatment"" and ""prevention"" as well as a combination of these terms. All English-language interventional studies assessing the efficacy and safety of VOC outcomes were evaluated. Literature was excluded if published in a language other than English or if it was a review article. A total of 69 articles were identified and there were 7 articles that met the search criteria. Majority of the studies focused on mean and median annual rates of VOCs as primary outcomes while median time to first sickle cell crises, median rates of hospitalizations etc were evaluated as secondary outcomes. After reviewing the literature, many patients with VOCs will still benefit from hydroxyurea therapy since long term efficacy data and cost is still a concern for the newer agents including L-glutamine, voxelotor and crizanlizumab. Other factors such as cost or compliance may also be taken into consideration when making recommendations for therapy."
33225591	Predictors of dental complications post-dental treatment in patients with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore potential medical or dental indicators associated with dental complications and the utilization of emergency services in sickle cell disease (SCD), especially that clinical reports on adverse outcomes post-dental treatment are scarce. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of dental treatments of 47 eligible adults with confirmed SCD between May 2016 and October 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used whether clinical outcomes, course of dental treatment, and regularity of dental care are associated with dental complications after dental procedures and/or resulted in emergency care or hospital admissions. RESULTS: We identified a new, statistically significant association (p-value = .01) between the number of prescription medications taken and complications (10%) after dental procedures. The most frequent dental procedures were tooth extractions (36%) and pain management (28%) during a non-scheduled dental encounter (68%). The majority of cases did not participate in regular recall exams and periodical oral hygiene maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: A higher number of prescription medications was associated with an increased risk of post-dental complications in SCD patients. A thorough medical history, including a list of prescribed medications, and collaboration with the patient medical team are important to assess the risk of complications post-dental procedures and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis according to the case complexity.
33275730	Neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease: measurement and management.	The identification of chronic pain and neuropathic pain as common contributors to the overall pain experience of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has altered the way we should evaluate difficult-to-treat pain. The recognition of these 2 entities is not generally routine among various medical specialties and provider levels that treat SCD. Due to the relative recency with which neuropathic pain was first described in SCD, validated assessment tools and evidence-based treatments remain lacking. Although clinical assessment and judgment must continue to inform all decision making in this understudied area of SCD pain management, a number of validated neuropathic pain assessment tools exist that can make possible a standardized evaluation process. Similarly, investigation of available neuropathic pain treatments for the uniquely complex pain phenotypes of SCD has only just begun and is better established in pain conditions other than SCD. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the proposed basic pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with SCD. Furthermore, the aim of this review is to encourage an expanded framework for the assessment and treatment of SCD pain that appreciates the hidden complexities of this common complication of SCD.
35194011	Sickle Cell Trait and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.	"BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the subsequent release of intracellular muscle constituents into the bloodstream. Although the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an ""open nucleolus"" in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After 40 days in the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin were 188 U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring acute HD. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger sickle-related complications like rhabdomyolysis, the presence of SCT needs to be ascertained in African patients."
32007639	Goal-Oriented Monitoring of Cyclosporine Is Effective for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia Major.	Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an important challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Herein we report our institution's experience of goal-oriented Bayesian monitoring for cyclosporine (CsA) used alone as GVHD prophylaxis during the post-transplant period in pediatric patients with thalassemia major (TM) or sickle cell anemia (SCA) undergoing HLA-matched HSCT. We also studied evolution of chimerism. Twenty-six consecutive patients (SCA, 14; TM, 12) underwent matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT from 2004 to 2014. All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of 20 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin in the conditioning regimens and then CsA alone in the post-transplant period. Target CsA trough blood concentration (TBC) was 150 +- 20 ng/mL. At last follow-up, all patients were alive and free of disease, even in cases of mixed chimerism. Engraftment occurred in all patients. No patient developed grades II to IV acute GVHD, 4 patients developed acute grade I skin GVHD, and only 1 presented with chronic pulmonary GVHD. A better control of GVHD and immunosuppression by a strict monitoring of CsA TBC as described herein is promising and could play a crucial role. Further investigations are required, but this study opens new perspectives to improve survival and safety of HSCT from alternative donors in TM and SCA to levels compatible with that obtained with MSDs.
37952647	Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.	Cardiopulmonary complications account for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and iron overload are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than 20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with SCD. We analyzed baseline and 1-year data from 12 adults with SCD who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography, and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.
36089470	Haploidentical stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease: current status.	For patients with high-risk sickle cell disease (SCD) without any available matched sibling or unrelated donor, haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploHCT) expands the availability of this life-saving intervention to nearly all patients who may benefit from HCT. The greatest challenge in haploHCT has been the significant risk of graft failure. Developing a treatment modality which sustains engraftment without increasing the incidence of debilitating graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the ultimate goal. A number of modifications have been explored to overcome the high incidence of graft rejection and severe GvHD including: (1) ex-vivo T-cell depletion (via CD34+ selection, CD3+/CD19+, or TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ depletion), and (2) in vivo T-cell depletion using unmanipulated grafts followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore, the presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) has been associated with an increased risk of both graft failure and poor graft function. Several approaches for desensitization ameliorate this risk when a suitable donor without DSA is not available. In addition to advances in supportive care, the recent demonstration that stable mixed chimerism post-HCT sufficiently sustains symptom-free status has opened the door for less toxic treatment approaches yielding excellent survival outcomes. Though late effects remain uncertain, the goal of finding the least toxic conditioning regimen while providing the highest rate of donor engraftment draws closer within reach. In this review, the authors aim to present the latest findings, challenges, and treatment modalities of this life-saving modality.
35583381	Assessment of donor cell engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: A review of current and future methods.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD), a debilitating red blood cell (RBC) disorder with significant prevalence worldwide. Accurate assessment of RBC engraftment following HSCT is essential to evaluate the status of the graft and can enable early intervention to treat or prevent graft rejection. Currently, chimerism measurement is performed on whole blood samples, which mainly reflect white blood cell (WBC) chimerism. This approach has limitations in assessing engraftment in patients with SCD because RBCs engraft non-linearly with WBCs. Direct measures of RBC chimerism exist but are not routinely used. In this review, we critically examine the current methodologies for assessing donor engraftment; highlight the limitations of these different methods, and present emerging and novel technologies with the potential to improve clinical monitoring of RBC engraftment post-HSCT for SCD. Promising alternative methodologies include RBC-specific flow cytometry, RBC-specific RNA analysis, and quantification of plasma cell-free DNA derived specifically from nucleated RBCs.
33785253	Treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: Historical aspects.	"The treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head has been the subject of numerous therapeutic and surgical proposals due to the absence of medical treatment with proven efficacy. For many years, the goal of surgical treatment was to avoid total hip replacement (THR) with uncertain survival in patients considered too young (30-50 years) for this procedure. Numerous conservative treatments were thus proposed: core decompression with numerous variants, non-vascularized and vascularized bone grafts, intertrochanteric and rotational transtrochanteric osteotomies, cementing. The lack of a common classification and a lack of knowledge of natural history complicated the interpretation of the results for a long time. Nevertheless, it appeared that these treatments were effective only in the very early stages and among these in the limited ONs, medial rather than central and especially lateral, with discrepancies according to etiologies apart from sickle cell disease recognized by all as being pejorative. For the same reason, partial arthroplasties have been attempted and abandoned in turn: femoral head total and partial resurfacing and femoral prosthesis. The most recent advances are stem-cell-enhanced core decompression and progress in total arthroplasty, whose reliability has made it possible to extend the indications to increasingly younger patients seeking treatment with guaranteed or near-guaranteed efficacy. Most of the other interventions have disappeared or almost disappeared because of their lack of effectiveness especially in extensive and post-fracture ONs, sometimes because of their complexity and the length of their post-operative management, and also because they complicate and penalize a future total arthroplasty. This argues for early detection of ON at an early stage where the ""head can be saved"" by stem cell augmented core decompression, a minimally invasive treatment that leaves the chances of success of a THR intact."
30747440	Automatic depletion with Spectra Optia allows a safe 16% reduction of red blood cell pack consumption in exchanged sickle cell anemia patients.	BACKGROUND: Chronic red blood cell exchanges (RBCXs) are frequently used to prevent complications in patients with sickle cell anemia, but the scarcity of matched red blood cell packs (RBCPs) is a serious concern. The main goal of this study was to compare the number of RBCPs used during RBCXs between the Spectra Optia (SO) device (with the automatic depletion step) and the former Cobe Spectra (CSP) device. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The performances and safety of 300 SO sessions using the automatic depletion step (SO/DE) in 50 patients with sickle cell anemia under a chronic transfusion program over a 1-year period were prospectively analyzed. The numbers of RBCPs saved using this protocol compared to the SO device without depletion and to the CSP device were determined. RESULTS: The SO/DE protocol appeared to be safe, as only 5% and 17% of the sessions were characterized by a significant decrease in blood pressure and increase in heart rate (grade 2 adverse events), respectively. Postapheresis hematocrit and fraction of cells remaining reached expected values. The SO/DE protocol required 16% fewer RBCPs compared to SO without depletion, allowing a mean saving of 12 RBCPs per patient and per year and 13% fewer compared to CSP device. Interestingly, the saving was more important for patients with high total blood volume and/or high preapheresis hematocrit. CONCLUSION: The SO/DE protocol is an efficient, safe and cost-effective procedure for patients with sickle cell anemia under a chronic transfusion program.
28370266	Inhaled steroids reduce pain and sVCAM levels in individuals with sickle cell disease: A triple-blind, randomized trial.	Clinical and preclinical data demonstrate that altered pulmonary physiology (including increased inflammation, increased blood flow, airway resistance, and hyper-reactivity) is an intrinsic component of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and may contribute to excess SCD morbidity and mortality. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a safe and effective therapy for pulmonary inflammation in asthma, may ameliorate the altered pulmonary physiologic milieu in SCD. With this single-center, longitudinal, randomized, triple-blind, placebo controlled trial we studied the efficacy and feasibility of ICS in 54 nonasthmatic individuals with SCD. Participants received once daily mometasone furoate 220 mcg dry powder inhalation or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was feasibility (the number who complete the trial divided by the total number enrolled) with prespecified efficacy outcomes including daily pain score over time (patient reported) and change in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) levels between entry and 8-weeks. For the primary outcome of feasibility, the result was 96% (52 of 54, 95% CI 87%-99%) for the intent-to-treat analysis and 83% (45 of 54, 95% CI 71%-91%) for the per-protocol analysis. The adjusted treatment effect of mometasone was a reduction in daily pain score of 1.42 points (95%CI 0.61-2.21, P = 0.001). Mometasone was associated with a reduction in sVCAM levels of 526.94 ng/mL more than placebo (95% CI 50.66-1003.23, P = 0.03). These results support further study of ICS in SCD including multicenter trials and longer durations of treatment. www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02061202).

31525477	First Report of Candida auris Spondylodiscitis in Oman: A Rare Presentation.	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging superbug which was recently discovered and has spread widely across the world. With a steady rise in incidence involving multisystems, this presents a unique challenge to caregivers. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man with sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, and multiple surgeries presented with progressive low back pain radiating to bilateral limbs and intact neurology. Radiologic and laboratory investigations suggested spondylodiscitis with epidural collection, which was operated with posterior decompression and stabilization. The tissue analysis was reported as C. auris, which was accordingly treated with caspofungin. Magnetic resonance imaging at 4 months showed resolution of infection with return of inflammatory markers to normal. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris appears to be an emerging superbug, which is hospital-acquired. All practitioners must be aware of its existence and presentation. Given the low incidence, high mortality, and no clear guidelines of management so far, formulation of any such strategies is complicated. Further studies and research are needed for this superbug.
35666654	Management of acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	INTRODUCTION: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) accounts for the highest mortality in Sickle cell disease patients. Early diagnosis and timely management of ACS results in better outcomes. However, the effectiveness of most treatment modalities for ACS management has not been established. AREAS COVERED: To review the treatment modalities management protocols and highlight the effectiveness of each option a literature search was done. Randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of different treatment modalities in ACS management in SCD patients were chosen and reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: 11 randomized controlled trials were found that evaluated the efficacy of incentive spirometry, positive expiratory pressure device, intravenous dexamethasone, oral vs. intravenous morphine, inhaled nitric oxide, unfractionated heparin, and blood transfusion in the prevention or treatment of ACS. Although there are guidelines for ACS treatment, the available evidence is very limited to delineating the effectiveness of various interventions in ACS management. More high-quality studies and trials with a larger patient population can benefit this area to support the recommendations with stronger evidence.
31522920	Therapeutic apheresis during pregnancy: A single center experience.	INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic apheresis (TA) represents a treatment option for pre-existing conditions or diseases occurring during gestation. Although pregnancy is not a contraindication per se, due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines and presumed risk of maternal/fetal adverse events there is a general resistance to its application. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2005 and August 2017, at the Apheresis Unit of the University Hospital of Padua 936 TA procedures were performed during 57 pregnancies in 48 patients: 813 Plasma Exchange sessions, 119 Immunoadsorptions, 4 Red Blood Cell exchanges. The treated disease were as follows: antiphospholipid syndrome (18 patients), autoimmune congenital heart block (18), myasthenia gravis (3), Rh alloimmunization (2), systemic sclerosis (1), suspected autoimmune encephalitis (1), severe hypertriglyceridaemia (1), post partum hemolytic-uremic syndrome (1), sickle cell disease (1), lupus nephritis (1) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (1). RESULTS: In the time period considered the apheresis sessions applied to pregnant women were 7.1% of the total (n = 13.251). The median age at the first treatment was 33 years. The median week of gestation (WG) at the beginning of treatments was 21. Twenty (2.1%) sessions were complicated by adverse events, none requiring or prolonging hospitalization. There were 50 live births, 5 spontaneous abortions and 2 voluntary terminations of pregnancy. Median WG at delivery was 35 and caesarean section was performed in 46 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that TA in pregnancy is well tolerated. Close collaboration between clinician, obstetrician and TA specialist is crucial to ensure a good outcome of high-risk pregnancies.
36244884	Combining PTCy and ATG for GvHD prophylaxis in non-malignant diseases.	Bone marrow transplantation for non-malignant diseases such as aplastic anemia and hemoglobinopathies is a burgeoning clinical area. The goal of these transplants is to correct the hematopoietic defect with as little toxicity as possible. This requires mitigation of transplant-specific toxicities such as graft versus host disease, given this is not needed in non-malignant disorders. This review details current clinical outcomes in the field with a focus on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and anti-thymoglobulin as intensive graft versus host disease prophylaxis to achieve that goal.
28806176	Evaluating the Use of Ketamine for Pain Control With Sickle Cell Crisis in Pregnancy: A Report of 2 Cases.	Sickle cell crises occur frequently during pregnancy and are difficult to treat, even with high-dose opioids. Analgesia with ketamine has been suggested as an alternative, but its use during pregnancy is underreported. Two pregnant patients with uncontrolled sickle cell pain were treated with ketamine. Patient A reported no decrease in her pain, but her opioid requirements decreased. Patient B's pain resolved during ketamine administration. No serious maternal or neonatal adverse effects occurred. Ketamine may be considered as an adjunct analgesic in pregnant patients with sickle cell pain, although prospective clinical data are needed to fully assess its efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Priapism is a urologic emergency that may require surgical intervention in cases refractory to supportive care. Exchange transfusion (ET) has been previously used to manage sickle cell disease (SCD), including in priapism; however, its utilization in the context of surgical intervention has not been well-established. AIM: To explore the utilization of ET, as well as other patient and hospital-level factors, associated with surgical intervention for SCD-induced priapism METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015), males diagnosed with SCD and priapism were stratified by need for surgical intervention. Survey-weighted regression models were used to analyze the association of ET to surgical intervention. Furthermore, negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare ET vs surgery to length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospital charges, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors of surgical intervention among patients with SCD-related priapism RESULTS: A weighted total of 8,087 hospitalizations were identified, with 1,782 (22%) receiving surgical intervention for priapism, 484 undergoing ET (6.0%), and 149 (1.8%) receiving combined therapy of both ET and surgery. On multivariable regression, pre-existing Elixhauser comorbidities (e.g. >=2 Elixhauser: OR: 2.20; P < 0.001), other forms of insurance (OR: 2.12; P < 0.001), and ET (OR: 1.99; P = 0.009) had increased odds of undergoing surgical intervention. In contrast, Black race (OR: 0.45; P < 0.001) and other co-existing SCD complications (e.g. infectious complications OR: 0.52; P < 0.001) reduced such odds. Compared to supportive care alone, patients undergoing ET (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10-1.83; P = 0.007) or combined therapy (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 111-1.82; P < 0.001) had a longer LOS vs. surgery alone (adjusted IRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97; P = 0.017). Patients receiving ET (adjusted Ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.52-3.76; P < 0.001) or combined therapy (adjusted Ratio: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.67-11.71; P = 0.003) had higher ratio of mean hospital charges compared with surgery alone (adjusted Ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.69-1.72; P = 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors were associated with the need for surgical intervention, including the use of ET. Those receiving ET, as well as those with combined therapy, had a longer LOS and increased total hospital charges. Ha AS, Wallace BK, Miles C, et al.

28185828	The role of molecular typing and perfect match transfusion in sickle cell disease and thalassaemia: An innovative transfusion strategy.	"Chronic red blood cell transfusions remain an essential part of supportive treatment in patients with thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions expose patients to the risk of developing antibodies: RBC alloimmunization occurs when the immune system meets foreign antigens. We created a register of extensively genotyped donors to achieve a better matched transfusion in order to reduce transfusion alloimmunization. Extended RBC antigen typing was determined and confirmed by molecular biology techniques using Human Erythrocyte Antigen (HEA) BeadChip (BioArray Solutions Ltd., Warren, NJ) in periodic blood donors and in patients with thalassaemia and SCD. During 3 years, we typed extensively 1220 periodic blood donors, 898 male and 322 female. We also studied 10 hematologic patients affected by thalassaemia and sickle cell disease referred to our institution as candidate to periodic transfusions. Our patients (8 females and 2 males with a median age of 48 years, range 24-76 years), extensively typed using molecular techniques and screened for RBC alloantibodies, were transfused with a median of 33.5 RBC units. After three years of molecular typing, the ""perfect match"" transfusion strategy avoided new alloantibodies development in all studied patients."
29803275	Treatment Options for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) complications begin with the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Thus, SCD therapies are focused on preventing HbS production or reducing the circulating amount of HbS. Hydroxyurea treatment has become more widespread, whereas the number of evidence-based indications for erythrocyte transfusion is small. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a curative option for SCD but less than 25% of patients have a suitable donor. This article focuses on supportive and preventive care improvements and the benefits of hydroxyurea. Indications for erythrocyte transfusion, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and gene therapy trials are also summarized.
28544309	Increased complications of chronic erythrocytapheresis compared with manual exchange transfusions in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk of strokes and are frequently treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. The goal is to suppress hemoglobin (Hb) S while minimizing transfusion-induced iron overload. RBCs may be given via simple transfusion, manual exchange transfusion (MET), or erythrocytapheresis (aRBCX). Chronic transfusion practices vary among institutions. METHODS: This single-institution, retrospective cohort study compares Hb S control and therapy complication rates between MET and aRBCX in a cohort of children and adolescents with SCD and stroke during a 5-year period from 2008 through 2012. Duration and mode of transfusion therapy, achievement of Hb S suppression goal, iron burden by ferritin levels, and catheter complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-seven children were included in analysis. The prevalence of catheter complications was 75% in aRBCX recipients compared with 0% in MET recipients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between modalities in achieving Hb S suppression or ferritin goals, but those receiving aRBCX had a greater likelihood of discontinuing chelation therapy. Among aRBCX recipients, adherence to >90% of transfusion appointments was associated with achieving Hb S suppression goals. CONCLUSION: aRBCX may have increased complication risks compared with MET for chronic transfusion therapy in SCD. Risks and benefits of aRBCX and MET should be considered when selecting a chronic transfusion modality. Transfusion therapy modalities should be compared in prospective studies for stroke prevention in children with SCD.

33408108	Bone marrow necrosis and fat embolism syndrome: a near fatal complication in previously undiagnosed sickle beta + thalassaemia.	Prevalence of haemoglobin sickle-beta+ thalassaemia (Hb S/beta+thal) is variable with geography ranging from 0.2% to 10% among sickle cell patients. Clinical presentation of Hb S/beta+thal patients depends on HbA level, with milder disease often going undiagnosed. However, rarely these patients can present with a fulminant vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Given VOC can present with non-specific symptoms, the diagnosis and treatment is often delayed. Here, we present a patient who initially developed altered mental status, pancytopenia and multiorgan failure due a critical VOC resulting in bone marrow necrosis and fat embolism. Subsequent workup confirmed that our patient had Sickle-beta+ thalassaemia, which had gone undiagnosed, despite subclinical evidence of haemolysis on routine lab work for years. Following diagnosis and initiation of RBC exchange, he improved significantly and was discharged home. High index of suspicion and bone marrow biopsy is vital for early diagnosis and management of this rare condition.
36481614	IF IM in a crisis: Intranasal fentanyl versus intravenous morphine in adult vaso-occlusive crisis.	IMPORTANCE: Studies have demonstrated the benefits of INF in reducing pain scores in pediatric patients with VOC due to sickle cell disease (SCD) and in adult patients with chronic pain conditions other than VOC, such as cancer. However, there is limited literature that exists describing the role of INF in adult patients with VOC due to SCD. Current literature demonstrates that the use of IV morphine for VOC patients leads to reduced pain. Therefore, comparing the use of INF with IV morphine will establish the degree of effectiveness of INF for VOC patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if intranasal fentanyl is equally as effective as IV morphine for treating VOC-associated pain in adult SCD patients. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective non-inferiority cohort study. Electronic health records were utilized to identify eligible patients between January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Patients who received INF as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED where allocated to the intervention group. On the other hand, individuals who received IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED were allocated to the control group. SETTING: A multi-site healthcare system containing five hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older, admitted to the ED with VOC due to SCD, and received INF or IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to evaluate the percent change in pain reduction after the initial dose of opiate between groups. Secondary outcomes include time to first rescue medication, total morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of IV opiates, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal within 6 h post- study drug administration, readmission within 48 h, and ED disposition. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were reviewed within the study period, 95 subjects met inclusion criteria, 31 subjects were included in the INF arm and 64 subjects in the IV morphine arm. The primary outcome showed an average percent pain reduction of 17.25% in the INF arm and 17.15% in the IV morphine arm. The point estimate difference was 0.1% (95% CI -9.3%-9.5%; non-inferiority (p < 0.0001). The median dose of IV opiates was 8 MME in the INF group, and 6 MME in the IV morphine group (p = 0.0268). The time from study drug to first rescue medication administration was 22.4 min and 27.3 min in the INF and IV morphine groups, respectively (p = 0.2231). There was no incidence of hypotension or respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal in either arm. Bradycardia occurred in 12.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.2042), readmission rates within 48 h due to VOC was 6.5% and 20.9% (p = 0.0553), and discharge from the ED to home was 16% and 66% (p = 0.0196) in INF and IV morphine arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: INF provided similar pain reduction compared to IV morphine in the treatment of adults with VOC presenting to the ED. IV morphine arm showed a statistically significant difference in discharge to home from the ED, however there was a trend in readmission within 48 h. The study showed no significant difference in hypotension, respiratory distress, or bradycardia between the groups. The INF group had no significant impact on time to drug administration compared to IV morphine, however it was within 1 h of patient presentation which complies with American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines. In conclusion, our study showed that INF was non-inferior when compared to IV morphine in reducing pain scores after drug administration. Therefore, INF is an effective alternative to IV morphine for pain management in adults presenting to the ED for VOC particularly in those with limited IV access.
37929626	Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Trait.	Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent isolated reports observed a rise in pain-related adverse events with the intravenous administration of the UCA Definity in adults with sickle cell disease. To date, no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison in children with sickle cell disease and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary routes. No pain-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric population with any route of UCA administration.
33431265	Liver transplantation for sickle cell disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterised by haemolytic anaemia. Liver is one of the most affected organs, ranging from liver tests alterations to acute liver failure for which liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment. METHODS: This study aims to make a systematic review of the current literature to evaluate indications, timing, and results of liver transplantation for patients affected by SCD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients in total were reported worldwide until 2018, the average patient age is 28.7 (0.42-56), all patients have a pre-transplant diagnosis of SCD. Cirrhosis at transplantation was present in six-teen (n = 16, 55.1%) patients. In ten patients (n = 10, 34.5%), acute liver failure arises from healthy liver and presented sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis. Eleven patients (n = 11, 39.2%) died, three (n = 3, 10.7%) in the first postoperative month, and seven (n = 7, 25%) in the first year. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range: 7-96), one-year overall survival was 48.7%. DISCUSSION: Liver transplantation for SCD has been increasingly reported with encouraging results. Indications are presently reserved for acute liver failure arising both in healthy liver and end-stage liver disease.
34489185	Complete neurological recovery from fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease after sequential red cell exchange transfusion and therapeutic plasma exchange.	"Fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease is associated with great mortality, while more than half of survivors suffer severe neurological sequelae. Release of fat droplets leads to obstruction of the microcirculation as well as generation of proinflammatory cytokines that can cause direct tissue injury. Red cell exchange transfusion can be life-saving but the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange may further improve outcomes by removing such inflammatory mediators. Here, we describe the case of a 27-year-old male patient with sickle cell anaemia presenting with typical features of fat embolism syndrome including neurological involvement with greatly reduced level of consciousness. MRI of his brain showed multiple widespread microhemorrhages giving the characteristic ""star field"" pattern but also a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum, known to be the result of direct neurotoxicity by proinflammatory cytokines. The patient underwent emergency red cell exchange transfusion leading only to modest clinical improvement but fully regained consciousness after three cycles of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case highlights the deleterious effect of the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of many sickle cell complications and supports further exploring the potential benefit from plasma exchange as an adjunct to red cell exchange in order to remove proinflammatory cytokines during acute complications of sickle cell disease."
30414734	Advances in the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder that afflicts approximately 100,000 Americans and millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises, relentless end-organ injury, and premature death. Currently, red blood cell transfusion and hydroxyurea are the major disease-modifying therapies available for SCD. Hematopoetic stem cell transplant is curative, but barriers to treatment are substantial and include a lack of suitable donors, immunologic transplant rejection, long-term adverse effects, prognostic uncertainty, and poor end-organ function, which is especially problematic for older patients. Gene therapy to correct the betas point mutation is under investigation as another curative modality. Deeper insights into the pathophysiology of SCD have led to the development of novel agents that target cellular adhesion, inflammation, oxidant injury, platelets and/or coagulation, vascular tone, and hemoglobin polymerization. These agents are in preclinical and clinical trials. One such agent, L-glutamine, decreases red blood cell oxidant injury and is recently US Food and Drug Administration approved to prevent acute pain episodes of SCD in patients 5 years of age or older. The purpose of this review is to describe the currently established therapies, barriers to curative therapies, and novel therapeutic agents that can target sickle cell hemoglobin polymerization and/or its downstream sequelae. A PubMed search was conducted for articles published up to May 15, 2018, using the search terms sickle cell disease, novel treatments, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy. Studies cited include case series, retrospective studies, prospective clinical trials, meta-analyses, online abstracts, and original reviews.
37694765	Mixed donor chimerism following stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is a debilitating hemoglobinopathy with high morbidity and mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative, but the presence of mixed donor/recipient chimerism post-HCT raises concerns about disease control long-term. Mixed donor/recipient chimerism is reported in significant numbers even after aggressive HCT conditioning regimens. Post-HCT, adequacy of donor erythropoiesis is crucial for disease control. This review explores the relationship between mixed donor/recipient chimerism and outcomes post-HCT. Serial chimerism analysis in lineage specific manner in erythroid or myeloid cells post-HCT predicts for disease control and HCT success. Adequate and stable donor-derived erythropoiesis is essential for reversing SCD manifestations. Myeloid lineage chimerism mirrors erythropoiesis is commercially available, and a reliable indicator of adequacy. Using this tool, the minimum threshold of donor chimerism is required to prevent SCD-related complications and maintain sickle hemoglobin less than 50% is approximately 20-25% even when a donor has Hb S trait. Curative interventions should, at a minimum, meet this goal long-term. Achieving a balance between successful engraftment while minimizing toxicity is important in patients vulnerable because of age or preexisting morbidity and is the objective of recent clinical trials. As HCT and gene therapies evolve, efficient long-term follow-up that includes durability assessment of mixed donor/recipient chimerism will be crucial.
34332804	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease: The why, who, and what.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs) from matched-related donors (MRDs), mismatched-related donors (MMRDs), and matched-unrelated donors (MUDs) are increasingly being used to treat sickle cell disease (SCD) in both pediatric and adult patients. The overall results have been extremely encouraging, especially if a MRD is available and the transplant being performed before the age of 13. Although there is a general consensus that patients with high-risk SCD, even in adults and irrespective of donor characteristics, should be offered allo-HSCT, the debates on optimal patient selection and timing of transplant have yet to be resolved. Unlike patients with hematologic malignancies, there are also a number of clinical issues that require to be addressed in patients with SCD undergoing allo-HSCT. In this review, we will discuss the reasons allo-HSCT should be offered more widely to patients with SCD, the challenges facing physicians in patient selection and timing of transplant, and the awareness of and solutions to prevent the complications that are unique or more common in SCD undergoing allo-HSCT.
31584682	Effect of Comprehensive Care Coordination on Medicaid Expenditures Compared With Usual Care Among Children and Youth With Chronic Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Medicaid spending on children and young adults with chronic disease could be decreased through care coordination programs by reducing unnecessary hospital and emergency care. Objective: To assess whether a comprehensive care coordination program reduces Medicaid expenditures by decreasing hospital and emergency department (ED) utilization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial included 6259 children and young adults with chronic disease who received public insurance through Illinois Medicaid. In April 2016, eligible youth were randomized to receive comprehensive care coordination through the Coordinated Healthcare for Complex Kids (CHECK) program (n = 3126) or usual care (n = 3119) to measure the effect of the CHECK program on Medicaid expenditures and health care utilization using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. Data were collected from May 1, 2014, to April 30, 2017, and analyzed in May 2018. Interventions: Care coordination, mental health care, education, and social support were provided to CHECK participants and their family members. Services were tailored based on family and participant need. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean annual Medicaid expenditures, mean annual health care utilization by category (ED and inpatient), and chronic disease type and risk level. Results: A total of 6259 participants (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [6.4] years; 2918 [46.6%] female; 2594 [41.4%] with medium and high risk) were randomized. Following the exclusion of 14 outliers, 6245 participants were analyzed. The mean (SD) annual Medicaid expenditure before the intervention was $1633 ($4006) for the intervention group and $1703 ($4466) for the usual care group, which decreased to a mean (SD) of $1341 ($3004) and $1413 ($3785), respectively, after the intervention (DID, -$1; 95% CI, -$199 to $196; P = .99). The mean (SD) inpatient utilization before the intervention was 63.0 (344.4) per 1000 person-years (PYs) for the intervention group and 69.3 (370.9) per 1000 PYs for the usual care group, which decreased to 43.5 (297.2) per 1000 PYs and 47.8 (304.9) per 1000 PYs, respectively, after the intervention (DID, 2.0; 95% CI, -17.9 to 21.8; P = .85). Among participants with asthma, those in the intervention group had a greater mean (SD) decrease in ED utilization compared with usual care, but the difference was not significant (-225.9 [65.3] vs -104.5 [80.0] visits per 1000 PY; DID, -121.5; 95% CI, -268.9 to 26.0; P = .11). Similarly, enrolled participants with sickle cell disease had a smaller but not significant mean (SD) increase in ED utilization compared with usual care (583.3 [839.0] vs 3761.9 [4611.2] visits per 1000 PYs; DID, -3178.6; 95% CI, -10 724.3 to 4367.2; P = .41). Conclusions and Relevance: Overall Medicaid expenditures and health care utilization (hospital and ED) decreased similarly for both CHECK participants and the usual care group. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04057521.
36161320	Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study.	lovo-cel (bb1111; LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease [SCD]) gene therapy (GT) comprises autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene (betaA-T87Q ) to produce anti-sickling hemoglobin (HbAT87Q ). The efficacy and safety of lovo-cel for SCD are being evaluated in the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02140554). The treatment process evolved over time, using learnings from outcomes in the initial patients to optimize lovo-cel's benefit-risk profile. Following modest expression of HbAT87Q in the initial patients (Group A, n = 7), alterations were made to the treatment process for patients subsequently enrolled in Group B (n = 2, patients B1 and B2), including improvements to cell collection and lovo-cel manufacturing. After 6 months, median Group A peripheral blood vector copy number (>=0.08 c/dg) and HbAT87Q levels (>=0.46 g/dL) were inadequate for substantial clinical effect but stable and sustained over 5.5 years; both markedly improved in Group B (patient B1: >=0.53 c/dg and >=2.69 g/dL; patient B2: >=2.14 c/dg and >=6.40 g/dL, respectively) and generated improved biologic and clinical efficacy in Group B, including higher total hemoglobin and decreased hemolysis. The safety of the lovo-cel for SCD treatment regimen largely reflected the known side effects of HSPC collection, busulfan conditioning regimen, and underlying SCD; acute myeloid leukemia was observed in two patients in Group A and deemed unlikely related to insertional oncogenesis. Changes made during development of the lovo-cel treatment process were associated with improved outcomes and provide lessons for future SCD GT studies.
30173539	Bronchodilator Use for Acute Chest Syndrome Among Large Pediatric Hospitals in North America.	The utility of bronchodilators to treat acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with sickle cell disease is unknown. Our objectives were to examine the variability in bronchodilator use for ACS among pediatric hospitals contributing to a large database and to examine the relationship between bronchodilator use and length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Between 2005 and 2011, bronchodilators were used during 6812/11 328 hospitalizations (60.1%) and use varied from 0.0% to 97.0% (median = 46.0%, interquartile range = 37.0% to 74.0%). Median LOS was 4 days, and interquartile range was 2 to 6 days. Bronchodilator use was associated with a 13.2% increase in LOS (95% confidence interval = 9.2% to 17.3%, P < .001). However, in the subgroup with asthma, bronchodilator use was associated with a 17.9% decrease in LOS (95% confidence interval = 1.7% to 31.4%, P = .03). There is wide variability in bronchodilator use for ACS, and it has variable association with LOS, depending on comorbid asthma. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate bronchodilators for ACS.
35894560	High-Priced Sickle Cell Gene Therapies Threaten to Exacerbate US Health Disparities and Establish New Pricing Precedents for Molecular Medicine.	Gene therapies to treat sickle cell disease are in development and are expected to have high costs. The large eligible population size - by far, the largest for a gene therapy - poses daunting budget challenges and threatens to exacerbate health disparities for Black patients, who make up the vast majority of American sickle cell patients.
32134128	Preoperative transfusion versus no transfusion policy in sickle cell disease patients: a randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Many children with sickle cell disease (SCD) indicated for adenotonsillectomy receive pre-operative transfusion therapy, either simple or exchange transfusion, in order to reduce surgical and sickle cell disease-related complications. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial aiming to compare between preoperative simple transfusion and no transfusion in pediatric patients with sickle SCD admitted in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman for adenotonsillectomy during the period from January 2014 through June 2018. They were randomly assigned into two arms (simple transfusion and no transfusion). RESULTS: Postoperative SCD-related complications have been encountered in 6 out of 138 patients (4.3%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two studied groups as regards the development of surgical or SCD-related complications (p = 0.6 and 0.8 respectively). The length of postoperative hospital stay was comparable in the two groups. (p = 0.607). SCD-related complications occurred exclusively in cases with homozygous sickle anemia (4 out of 81 = 4.9%). CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease patients with a hemoglobin level above 7.5 g/dL do not need PRBCs transfusion prior to adenotonsillectomy. This approach did not increase the risk of postoperative surgical or SCD-related complications.
30200783	Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies.	Gene therapy for beta-thalassemia and sickle-cell disease is based on transplantation of genetically corrected, autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic approach, currently based on lentiviral vectors to transfer a beta-globin gene under the transcriptional control of regulatory elements of the beta-globin locus. Nevertheless, a number of factors are still limiting its efficacy, such as limited stem-cell dose and quality, suboptimal gene transfer efficiency and gene expression levels, and toxicity of myeloablative regimens. In addition, the cost and complexity of the current vector and cell manufacturing clearly limits its application to patients living in less favored countries, where hemoglobinopathies may reach endemic proportions. Gene-editing technology may provide a therapeutic alternative overcoming some of these limitations, though proving its safety and efficacy will most likely require extensive clinical investigation.
28470719	From total blood exchange to erythrocytapheresis and back to treat complications of sickle cell disease.	Erythrocytapheresis is an important procedure in the management of certain complications of sickle cell disease, including acute stroke, stroke prevention, acute chest syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Erythrocytapheresis in sickle cell disease simply entails the removal of the patient's red blood cells containing the abnormal sickle hemoglobin and replacing them with normal red blood cells carrying normal hemoglobin. In these procedures, the patient's plasma is not exchanged but is returned to the patient. Several studies have demonstrated that the plasma of patients with sickle cell disease contains several components that increase blood viscosity and initiate or promote vaso-occlusion. These factors include increased levels of globulins, especially immunoglobulin G, acute-phase reactants, fibrinogen, coagulation factors, inflammatory mediators, and heme in the steady state and increase further during painful crises. This may explain why, in certain complications of sickle cell disease, such as acute chest syndrome, hepatic crisis, and priapism, erythrocytapheresis by itself may not be effective despite repetitive cycles of red blood cell exchange. The use of therapeutic plasma exchange in addition to erythrocytapheresis in these situations seems to be useful in resolving them more efficiently. The role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of certain complications of sickle cell disease needs further evaluation. This commentary addresses the role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of complications of sickle cell disease.
35404888	Outpatient Pain Management in Children With Chronic Pancreatitis: A Scoping Systematic Review.	"OBJECTIVES: Although pain management is central to pediatric chronic pancreatitis (CP) care, no evidence-based guidelines exist. In this scoping systematic review, we sought promising strategies for CP pain treatment in children. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on pain management in children and adults with CP, and 2 conditions with similar pain courses: juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Of 8997 studies identified, 287 met inclusion criteria. There are no published studies of analgesic medications, antioxidants, dietary modification, integrative medicine, or regional nerve blocks in children with CP. In adults with CP, studies of nonopioid analgesics, pancreatic enzymes, and dietary interventions have mixed results. Retrospective studies suggest that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures, most durably total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant, improve pain for children with CP. Follow-up was short relative to a child's life. Large studies in adults also suggest benefit from endoscopic therapy and surgery, but lack conclusive evidence about optimal procedure or timing. Studies on other painful pediatric chronic illnesses revealed little generalizable to children with CP. CONCLUSIONS: No therapy had sufficient high-quality studies to warrant untempered, evidence-based support for use in children with CP. Multicenter studies are needed to identify pain management ""best practices."""
33077498	Manipulation of Developmental Gamma-Globin Gene Expression: an Approach for Healing Hemoglobinopathies.	beta-Hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders, and a century of research has provided us with a better understanding of the attributes of these diseases. Allogenic stem cell transplantation was the only potentially curative option available for these diseases until the discovery of gene therapy. The findings on the protective nature of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia patients carrying hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) mutations has given us the best evidence that the cure for beta-hemoglobinopathies remains hidden in the hemoglobin locus. The detailed understanding of the developmental gene regulation of gamma-globin (gamma-globin) and the emergence of gene manipulation strategies offer us the opportunity for developing a gamma-globin gene-modified autologous stem cell transplantation therapy. In this review, we summarize different therapeutic strategies that reactivate fetal hemoglobin for the gene therapy of beta-hemoglobinopathies.
30837199	Clinical presentation of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy is a key component in the comprehensive management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Consequently, most adult SCD patients will receive at least one, and many will receive more than a hundred RBC transfusions in their lifetime. SCD patients develop RBC alloantibodies much more frequently than non-SCD transfused patients, which often make the selection of compatible RBCs extremely difficult, in addition to placing patients at significantly higher risk of suffering from delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs). Similar to alloimunization, DHTRs are much more common in patients with SCD compared to other heavily transfused populations, and are particularly consequential due to their propensity to cause hyperhemolysis, a life-threatening phenomenon in which both transfused RBCs in addition to the patient's own sickle-erythrocytes are destroyed. In this review, we highlight the incidence and pathophysiology of DHTRs; illustrate common presentations, appropriate evaluations and outcomes of DHTRs in patients with SCD; and discuss strategies for preventing or reducing the likelihood of DHTRs from occurring.
31231794	Advances in the gene therapy of monogenic blood cell diseases.	Hematopoietic gene therapy has markedly progressed during the last 15 years both in terms of safety and efficacy. While a number of serious adverse events (SAE) were initially generated as a consequence of genotoxic insertions of gamma-retroviral vectors in the cell genome, no SAEs and excellent outcomes have been reported in patients infused with autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with self-inactivated lentiviral and gammaretroviral vectors. Advances in the field of HSC gene therapy have extended the number of monogenic diseases that can be treated with these approaches. Nowadays, evidence of clinical efficacy has been shown not only in primary immunodeficiencies, but also in other hematopoietic diseases, including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. In addition to the rapid progression of non-targeted gene therapies in the clinic, new approaches based on gene editing have been developed thanks to the discovery of designed nucleases and improved non-integrative vectors, which have markedly increased the efficacy and specificity of gene targeting to levels compatible with its clinical application. Based on advances achieved in the field of gene therapy, it can be envisaged that these therapies will soon be part of the therapeutic approaches used to treat life-threatening diseases of the hematopoietic system.
31074115	High incidence of venous thromboembolism recurrence in patients with sickle cell disease.	Previous reports show increased incidence of venous thromboembolism [VTE, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE)] in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. The incidence, time course, and risk factors for VTE recurrence have been less well described. We determined the cumulative incidence of first VTE recurrence and bleeding in a cohort of SCD patients with incident VTE. Risk factors for recurrence and bleeding were also determined using multivariable Cox regression models, adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, era of incident VTE, location and hospitalization-associated status of incident VTE, and SCD-related complications. Results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 877 SCD patients with an incident VTE, the 1-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 13.2% (95% CI 11.0%-15.5%) and 24.1% (95% CI 21.2%-27.1%). Risk factors for VTE recurrence included more severe SCD (HR = 2.41; CI: 1.67-3.47), lower extremity DVT as the incident event (HR = 1.64; CI: 1.17-2.30), and pneumonia/acute chest syndrome (HR = 1.68; CI: 1.15-2.45). The cumulative incidence of bleeding was 4.9% (CI 3.5%-6.4%) at 6 months and 7.9% (CI: 6.2%-9.8%) at 1 year. More severe SCD (HR = 1.61; CI: 1.11-2.35) was associated with bleeding. The high incidence of VTE recurrence in patients with SCD suggests that extended anticoagulation may be indicated; however, this must be weighed against a relatively high risk of bleeding. Prospective, randomized studies of anticoagulation in SCD patients with VTE are needed.
34850464	Sickle cell disease patients in two London trusts: Genotyping including RH variants.	BACKGROUND: All SCD patients need extended RBC antigen typing (by serology or genotyping) for provision of extended RH, K matched blood and to guide RBC selection in those with complex transfusion requirements. Genotyping can also identify RH variants which can cause sensitisation even when extended RH phenotypically matched blood is provided and alloantibodies associated with RH variants can cause HTRs. OBJECTIVES: To review the use of RBC genotyping in SCD patients at two London trusts (ICHNT, LNWH) with a focus on RH variants. METHODS: Retrospective review with data collected from clinical notes, local and national pathology reporting systems. RESULTS: A 311/482 (64%) ICHNT patients and 181/346 (52%) LNWH patients had extended genotyping. Of genotyped patients, 68 (22%) ICHNT and 31 (17%) LNWH patients had RH variants. Eight ICHNT patients had RH variants and corresponding antibodies associated with RH variants; 4/8 received multiple transfusions with antigen positive RBCs but had no evidence of haemolysis. One LNWH patient had a RH variant with corresponding alloantibody but could not be investigated further for possible HTR. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients (59%) had genotyping and a significant number had RH variants (99, 20%). A small proportion (9, 9%) had antibodies associated with RH variants, but with no evidence of clinically significant HTRs despite transfusions in four of them with antigen positive RBCs. All SCD patients should have RBC genotyping including RH variants (preferentially over extended phenotyping) to guide better selection of RBC units. However, where antigen negative blood cannot be provided, the risk of alloimmunisation is not inevitable and subsequent HTRs from antibodies associated with RH variants might not always occur.
29728697	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adult sickle cell disease in the era of universal donor availibility.	Current projections estimate that the number of newborns with sickle cell disease (SCD) globally will exceed 400,000 by 2050. Over the last three decades, increased newborn screening, supportive care, and use of hydroxyurea therapy, have decreased early childhood mortality among individuals affected with SCD. Despite hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) being curative in SCD, its impact on disease free survival remains unknown, especially in adults, partly due to previous limitations in donor options and perceived mortality in adults using myeloablative conditioning. Novel non-myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens have made HCT safer and applicable to adults with SCD who were previously excluded. Other reasons for limited use of HCT in SCD includes referral bias, provider preference, poor education of patient/families, perceived procedure risks, costs and limited logistic resources in both low income, middle income, and high income countries. Current data from landmark studies indicate that both the long-term disease-free survival and overall survival exceed 90% after matched sibling donor HCT in children. Improving transplant outcomes and expanding donor pool will increase the use of transplant for SCD, especially in affected adults. On-going investigations using matched umbilical cord units, unrelated matched donor, and related haploidentical donors, promises to make HCT a viable option for nearly all eligible patients with SCD. This systematic review focuses on the recent data for HCT for patients with adult SCD with particular emphasis on donor sources and availability as illustrated by a case presentation exhibiting real world issues.
32032243	Liver Stiffness Measurement by Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography Does Not Correlate to Hepatic Iron Overload in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of liver injury because of sickle cell hepatopathy and iron overload from chronic transfusions (CT). The authors examine the association between iron overload and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE), which has been shown to correlate with fibrosis. METHODS: Patients 21 years of age and less with SCD had VCTE performed; those who received CT underwent magnetic resonance imaging T2* for iron quantification. RESULTS: The authors enrolled 42 patients, 17 (40%) of whom received CT. There was no difference in LSM between patients who underwent CT (5.5+-1.5 kPa) and those who did not (5.2+-2.3 kPa) (P=0.923). There was no correlation between iron quantification and LSM (r=-0.077, P=0.769). However, children 12 years of age and older had abnormal LSM when compared with a reference range (P=0.013). CONCLUSION: VCTE is a noninvasive technology that is feasible in children with SCD. LSM values were elevated in older children but did not correlate with iron overload, suggesting that fibrosis may not be affected by iron overload alone. Though additional data are needed, LSM may be a useful test for the progression of liver disease in SCD regardless of iron burden.
38161155	Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain.	Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
30616808	Novel Sickle Cell Disease Therapies: Targeting Pathways Downstream of Sickling.	Sickle cell disease is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by hemolytic anemia, frequent painful episodes, poor quality of life, end organ damage and a shortened lifespan. Although the seminal event is the polymerization of the abnormal hemoglobin, the downstream pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion results from heterotypic interactions between the altered, adhesive sickle cell RBCs, neutrophils, endothelium, and platelets. Ischemia reperfusion injury, hemolysis and oxidant damage all contribute to heightened inflammation and activation of the hemostatic system. These downstream targets are the focus of emerging treatments with considerable potential to ameliorate disease manifestations. This review summarizes the progress on development of these agents.
35131182	Therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of acute complications of sickle cell disease: A single centre experience.	Sickle cell disease results in systemic inflammation even at steady state and this is accentuated during acute crises. The plasma of affected patients contains several proinflammatory cytokines as well as adhesion molecules and prothrombotic factors. This environment promotes further red cell sickling while many of these substances can cause direct tissue toxicity and end-organ damage. Even though red cell transfusion, whether simple or exchange, is the mainstay of treatment of severe acute complications, addition of therapeutic plasma exchange could potentially provide additional benefit by removing such harmful substances. Here, we describe two cases where therapeutic plasma exchange was used. The first involved a patient with the acute chest syndrome who despite adequate red cell exchange remained significantly hypoxic and in severe pain. We therefore proceeded to perform plasma exchange; this led to rapid clinical improvement and resolution of his symptoms. The second case involved a patient with intractable chest wall pain and impending acute chest syndrome; this patient also had a past history of hyperhaemolysis. The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange with very rapid resolution of the pain, avoidance of any respiratory deterioration and full recovery. We also give a brief summary of our previous experience using plasma exchange in patients with sickle cell disease. Plasma exchange was well tolerated with no adverse events in all cases we have treated, led to rapid resolution of pain irrespective of primary indication and in the majority of cases to a favourable clinical outcome.
29224750	Blood transfusion in children with sickle cell disease undergoing tonsillectomy.	INTRODUCTION: Tonsillectomy is the second most common surgery in children with sickle cell disease. These children are at an increased risk of perioperative complications due to vaso-occlusive events. Although controversial, preoperative blood transfusions are sometimes given in an effort to prevent such complications. The purpose of this study is to analyze trends in the use of blood transfusion for management of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing tonsillectomy in a national database. METHODS: Patients in the 1997-2012 KID with a primary procedure matching the ICD-9 procedure code for tonsillectomy (28.2-28.3) and diagnosis code for SCD (282.60-282.69) were examined. Patients were split into groups by blood transfusion status and compared across variables including complication rate, length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges. Statistical analysis included chi-square test for trend, Mann-Whitney U test, and independent t-test. RESULTS: 1133 patients with SCD underwent tonsillectomy. There was a strong positive correlation between increasing chronologic year and the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusions, 47 (30.1%) in 1997 to 78 (42.5%) in 2012 (r = 0.94, p = 0.005). During this period, there was no significant change in the rate of complications (r = -0.1, p = 0.87). Overall, patients receiving blood transfusion had a longer mean LOS (3.1 +- 2.4 days vs. 2.5 +- 2.2 days, p < 0.005) and higher mean charge ($17,318 +- 13,191 vs. $13,532 +- 12,124, p < 0.005) compared to patients who did not receive blood transfusion. The rate of complications in the transfusion group, 18 of 352(5.1%), was not significantly different (p = 0.48) from the group without transfusion, 40 of 626 (6.4%). CONCLUSIONS: From 1997 to 2012, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with SCD receiving perioperative blood transfusions for tonsillectomy. While the frequency of transfusion rose, those who received a transfusion had similar complication rates with increased charges and length of hospital stays compared to those who did not receive a transfusion.
38578371	Partial Splenic Embolization in Paediatric Sickle Cell Disease Patients with Hypersplenism.	PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of partial splenic embolization (PSE) to reduce the need of transfusions and improve hematologic parameters in patients with hypersplenism and sickle cell disease (SCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study includes 35 homozygous hemoglobin S patients with SCD and hypersplenism who underwent PSE from 2015 until 2021 in Kinshasa. Patients were evaluated, before and after PSE (1, 3 and 6 months), using clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic methods. PSE was performed with the administration of gelatin sponge particles embolizing 60-70% of the splenic parenchyma. RESULTS: The mean age was 10 (+- 4) years and (21/35, 60%) were male. After PSE Leucocytes decreased at 3 months (16 692.94 vs 13 582.86, p = 0.02) and at six months Erythrocytes increased 2 004 000 vs. 2 804 142 (p < 0.001), Platelets increased (168 147 vs. 308 445, p < 0.001) and Hemoglobin increased (5.05 g/dL vs. 6.31 g/dL, p < 0.001) There was a significant dicrease in the need of transfusions from 6 (2-20) before PSE to 0.06 (0-1) after PSE (p < 0.001). The most frequent complication was splenic rupture (4/35, 11.4%), seen only and in all patients with hypoechogenic nodules at baseline. CONCLUSION: PSE is a safe procedure in patients with SCD and hypersplenism, that do not have hypoechogenic nodules in the spleen. PSE improves the hematological parameters and reduces the frequency of blood transfusions.

32614805	Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia in a Sickle Cell Trait Patient: A Report of a Rare Case with Use of Nuclear Medicine, and a Literature Review.	BACKGROUND Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant disease. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case of a 49-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of multiple hospitalizations, sometimes life-threatening anemia, and uncommon clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS We provide a brief literature review regarding the most common signs and symptoms, history, diagnosis, and treatment. Special attention is given to the techniques for identifying hemorrhagic areas, to the presence of angiodysplasia in gastric tissue, and the identification of sickle cell trait, this being an unprecedented hematological condition in the presentation of the disease. Thus, further studies on the relationship between sickle cell trait and the syndrome are needed.
38205646	Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.
37317564	Plasma exchange-A useful adjunct therapy to red cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease and multiorgan dysfunction.	BACKGROUND: Urgent red cell exchange (RBCx) is indicated for many complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including acute chest syndrome, stroke, and hepatic/splenic sequestration. Many who receive RBCx remain hospitalized and develop further complications, including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in intensive care units. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been advocated as an effective treatment of MODS, but its role in SCD compared with RBCx alone is not well studied. METHODS: We identified all ICU encounters from 2013 to 2019 involving RBCx procedures for MODS or SCD crisis that progressed to MODS, a total of 12 encounters. Data regarding hospital length of stay (LOS), survival, number of TPE procedures following RBCx, and procedure characteristics were collected. Surrogate laboratory markers of end-organ damage and disease severity scores were recorded at the time of admission, post-RBCx, post-TPE, and at discharge. RESULTS: Eight encounters involved RBCx followed by TPE (TPE group) while four involved RBCx alone (RBCx group). The TPE group had a higher SOFA score at ICU admission (9.5 vs. 7.0), greater predicted mortality, and a statistical trend toward higher disease severity scores following RBCx relative to the RBCx group (p = 0.10). The TPE group showed a significantly greater decrease in SOFA score between RBCx and discharge (p = 0.04). No significant difference in mortality or hospital LOS was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest TPE may be considered as an adjunct treatment for patients with acute complications of SCD that progress to MODS, especially in cases where there is no significant improvement following RBCx.
38263886	Reversal of Cerebral Arteriopathy Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disorder which causes progressive cerebral arteriopathy beginning in childhood. As a result, arterial ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, and SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with SCD. Long-term outcomes and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with SCD who presented with arterial ischemic stroke at 6 years of age and was found to have a severe form of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy by catheter-directed angiography. The patient initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later, he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed angiography revealed a striking reversal of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy. This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect of HSCT that may ameliorate cerebral large vessel arteriopathy and improve cerebrovascular health for children with SCD.
34254882	A Comparison of Two Regimens for Managing Sickle Cell Pain and Reducing Readmissions.	This was a multicenter retrospective analysis comparing intravenous push (IVP) analgesia versus patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients admitted for sickle cell pain crisis. The primary objective was to compare the analgesic management, measured in total daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Secondary objectives included length of hospitalization, 30-day hospital readmissions and pain scores. Of the 98 patients identified between August 2017 and August 2018, 68 patients were included in this study. There were 51% (n = 35) in the IVP group and 49% (n = 33) in the PCA group. The majority of patients were on 90 or more daily MME prior to admission. The average total daily MME was significantly higher in patients on PCA compared to IVP on the first three days of hospitalization (289 vs 146, p < 0.01). Length of hospitalization was not different between patients on IVP and PCA (7.14 vs. 6.39 days, p = 0.53). There was no difference in 30-day readmissions, average pain scores on days 1-3 of hospitalization and adverse side effects between the groups. This study showed patients on IVP had significantly lower total daily MME requirements compared to PCA within the first three calendar days of admission.
30644285	Polymethylmethacrylate-augmented fenestreted pedicle-screw fixation in low bone quality patients: a case series and literature review.	The use of pedicle screws in low bone quality patients implicates risks of secondary implant loosening for grip lack. In fact, the result is a reduced mechanical stability at bone-screw interface and consequently an increased chance of pullout and hardware failure. Augmentation techniques have been described for many years and fenestrated screws that allow cement injection is one of them. This is a retrospective observational study of patients treated at our department with polymethylmethacrylate- (PMMA) augmented fenestrated screws. Indications for posterior instrumentation were traumatic fracture in osteoporotic spine, oncological disease, post-traumatic deformity, degenerative disease, revision surgery and sickle cell disease fractures. Implant stability was evaluated with X-Rays and CT scan performed 3 days after surgery and every 3 months during the follow-up. Accuracy of screw placement was evaluated with Heary classification. Fifty-three surgical treatments in 52 patients were performed and 247 PMMA augmented fenestrated screws were placed. According to the Heary classification, 96.21% resulted Grade I, 1.8% Grade II, 2% Grade IV. A total of 17 complications occurred. Fenestrated screw augmentation should be performed in selected patients in whom the bone quality is insufficient to guarantee implant stability. These screws may result useful in complex cases as revision surgeries, osteoporosis and tumour affections where bone quality is highly compromised.
28801781	Acute pain crisis in a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing ovarian simulation for fertility preservation prior to curative stem cell transplantation: case report and literature review.	PURPOSE: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) but frequently results in permanent sterility. The complications associated with oocyte cryopreservation and risks of future pregnancy are increased in SCD patients. This case report discusses risk reduction strategies and includes a literature review of pregnancy after HSCT. CASE: A 23-year-old woman underwent ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation resulting in cancelation due to acute pain crisis. She underwent a successful oocyte retrieval after exchange transfusion to decrease her hemoglobin S to 30%. This is the second report of a pain crisis in a woman with SCD undergoing oocyte banking. CONCLUSION(S): Women with SCD undergoing fertility preservation may be at increased risk of complications from ovarian stimulation. Risks in pregnancy after HSCT should also be considered before proceeding with fertility preservation.
30161070	Recommendations on RBC Transfusion Support in Children With Hematologic and Oncologic Diagnoses From the Pediatric Critical Care Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative.	OBJECTIVES: To present the recommendations and supporting evidence for RBC transfusions in critically ill children with hematologic and oncologic disease from the Pediatric Critical Care Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative. DESIGN: Consensus conference series of international, multidisciplinary experts in RBC transfusion management of critically ill children. METHODS: The panel of 38 experts developed evidence-based and, when evidence was lacking, expert-based clinical recommendations and research priorities for RBC transfusions in critically ill children. The hematologic/oncologic subgroup included seven experts. Electronic searches were conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to May 2017. Agreement was obtained using the Research and Development/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method. RESULTS: The hematologic/oncologic subgroup developed 14 recommendations (seven clinical, seven research); all achieved greater than 80% agreement. In patients with sickle cell disease, Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative recommends: 1) RBC transfusion to achieve a target hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL rather than hemoglobin of less than 30% prior to surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia and 2) exchange transfusion over simple (nonexchange) transfusion if the child's condition is deteriorating (based on clinical judgment), otherwise a simple, nonexchange RBC transfusion is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations on transfusion thresholds for patients with sickle cell disease prior to minor procedures, with acute stroke or with pulmonary hypertension. For patients with oncologic disease or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, a hemoglobin concentration of 7-8 g/dL is recommended. Due to lack of evidence, research is needed to clarify the appropriate transfusion thresholds in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative developed specific pediatric recommendations regarding RBC transfusion management in critically ill children with sickle cell disease, oncologic disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant and recommendations to help guide future research priorities.
33119448	The association between hydroxyurea adherence and opioid utilization among Texas Medicaid enrollees with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from recurrent catastrophic pain crises that are often managed by opioid analgesics. Being adherent to hydroxyurea has been associated with decreased health care resource use for pain; however, evidence of its association with opioid use is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine if adherence to hydroxyurea is associated with opioid use among patients with SCD. METHODS: This retrospective study used Texas Medicaid data from September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2016 (study period). The index date was the date of hydroxyurea initiation. Patients who were aged 2-63 years at the index date, had >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient SCD diagnoses during the study period, had >= 1 hydroxyurea prescription during the identification period (September 1, 2011-August 31, 2015), had no diagnosis of other indications for hydroxyurea during the study period, and were continuously enrolled for at least 12 months after the index date were included. Hydroxyurea adherence was measured using medication possession ratio (MPR). The study outcomes (measured 1-year post-index) were (a) opioid use; (b) number of opioid prescriptions; (c) strong opioid use (morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and methadone); (d) number of strong opioid prescriptions; (e) high-dose opioid use (>= 50 mg morphine milligram equivalent [MME]); and (f) days supply for opioid prescriptions. Covariates included demographic (age and gender) and clinical (vaso-occlusive crisis [VOC], avascular necrosis, iron overload, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusion) characteristics. Descriptive, bivariate (chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests), multiple logistic regression, and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 1,146 patients (18.3 [12.3] years) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 19.6% were adherent to hydroxyurea (defined as MPR >= 80%) and mean (SD) MPR was 48.3% (29.7%). In the 1 year following hydroxyurea initiation, 923 (80.5%) patients had >= 1 opioid prescription with 7.6 (9.4) opioid prescriptions per patient, while 259 (22.6%) patients had >= 1 strong opioid prescription with 1.5 (4.4) strong opioid prescriptions per patient. Average (SD) opioid dose was 41.7 (74.3) mg MME, and 27.1% had high daily MME doses (>= 50 mg MME). Average (SD) opioid days supply was 83.1 (112.2) days. After adjusting for covariates, compared with being nonadherent, being adherent to hydroxyurea was associated with a 50.5% decreased risk of having strong opioids (OR = 0.495, 95% CI = 0.278-0.879, P = 0.0165). Additionally, SCD-related complications (VOC, avascular necrosis, and iron overload) and older age were significant factors associated with opioid use and higher MME. Post hoc analyses showed that being adherent to hydroxyurea was significantly associated with lower probabilities of experiencing SCD-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that patients with SCD are moderately adherent to hydroxyurea. Being adherent to hydroxyurea was found to be associated with a lower risk of receiving a prescription for strong opioids. Findings suggest that close monitoring and interventions to improve adherence may help mitigate strong opioid use among these patients. DISCLOSURES: This research did not receive any specific funding. Barner and Kang report grants from Novartis Pharmaceuticals, unrelated to this work. A part of this study was presented as a poster at the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) 2019 Annual Meeting and Exposition (March 22-25, 2019, Seattle, WA) and received the 2019 APhA-APRS Presentation Award in the APhA-APRS Contributed Research Paper, Graduate Student/Fellow/Postdoctoral Scholar category.

30182371	The effect of red-blood-cell transfusion on fatigue in hospitalized patients with anaemia.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Guidelines suggest that red-blood-cell transfusion decisions for most hospitalized patients be based on haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and the presence of symptoms of anaemia, including fatigue. However, studies differ in whether transfusion is associated with improvements in fatigue. One explanation is that the benefit of transfusion varies by baseline fatigue levels, which existing studies have not examined. The objective of this study was to determine whether the association between transfusion during hospitalization and improvements in fatigue 30 days postdischarge varies by baseline fatigue level. METHODS: A prospective observational study of hospitalized general medicine patients with any Hb <9 g/dl. Patients with sickle cell anaemia and gastrointestinal bleeding were excluded since these diagnoses have alternative transfusion practices. Patients with depression were excluded because their fatigue is not primarily due to anaemia. Fatigue was measured during an in-person interview and a 30-day postdischarge phone interview. Hb values and receipt of a transfusion were collected from hospital administrative data. Linear regression was used to test associations between 'change in fatigue', Hb concentration and receipt of a transfusion. RESULTS: Transfusion interacted with nadir Hb was associated with reduced fatigue postdischarge for patients with higher baseline fatigue (20% most fatigued: beta = 12, P = 0 02; 10% most fatigued: beta = 17, P = 0 02). Patients <50 years old with high baseline fatigue had large reductions in fatigue from transfusion (20%: beta = 23, P = 0 02; 10%: beta = 29, P = 0 03). CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion during hospitalization is associated with reduced fatigue 30 days postdischarge in patients with higher levels of baseline fatigue.
33098344	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from sibling and unrelated donors in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease-A single center experience.	HSCT is curative in SCD. Patients with HLA-identical sibling donor have an excellent outcome ranging from 90%-100% overall and event-free survival. However, due to the lack of matched sibling donors this option is out of reach for 70% of patients with SCD. The pool of potential donors needs to be extended. Transplantations from HLA-matched unrelated donors were reported to be less successful with shorter event-free survival and higher incidences of complications including graft-vs-host disease, especially in patients with advanced stage SCD. Here we report transplantation outcomes for 25 children with SCD transplanted using HLA-matched grafts from related or unrelated donors. Overall survival was 100% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host disease and a 12% rejection rate. Mixed donor chimerisms only occurred in transplantations from siblings, while transplantations from unrelated donors resulted in either complete donor chimerism or rejection. Despite the small patient number, overall and disease-free survival for unrelated donor transplantations is excellent in this cohort. The advanced disease state, higher alloreactive effect and stronger immunosuppression in unrelated donor transplantations raises patient risk, for which possible solutions could be found in optimization of transplant preparation, graft manipulation or haploidentical transplantation using T cell receptor alpha/beta-depleted grafts.
30187935	A dose-ranging study of ticagrelor in children aged 3-17 years with sickle cell disease: A 2-part phase 2 study.	Antiplatelet treatment is a potential therapeutic approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). Ticagrelor inhibits platelet aggregation and is approved for adults with acute coronary syndrome and following myocardial infarction. HESTIA1 (NCT02214121) was a 2-part, phase 2 dose-finding study generating ticagrelor exposure, platelet inhibition, and safety data in children with SCD (3-17 years). In part A (n = 45), patients received 2 ticagrelor single doses, 0.125-2.25 mg/kg (washout >=7 days), then 7 days of twice-daily (bid) dosing with 0.125, 0.563, or 0.75 mg/kg. In the 4-week blinded Part B extension (optional), patients received ticagrelor (0.125, 0.563, or 0.75 mg/kg bid; n = 16) or placebo (n = 7). Platelet reactivity decreased from baseline to 2 hours postdosing, and returned to near baseline after 6 hours postdosing. Dose-dependent platelet inhibition was seen with ticagrelor; mean relative P2Y12 reaction unit inhibition 2 hours after a single dose ranged from 6% (0.125 mg/kg) to 73% (2.25 mg/kg). Ticagrelor plasma exposure increased approximately dose proportionally. No patients experienced a hemorrhagic event during treatment. No differences were seen between groups in pain ratings and analgesic use during Part B. Ticagrelor was well tolerated with no safety concerns, no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs), and reported AEs were mainly due to SCD. In conclusion, a dose-exposure-response relationship for ticagrelor was demonstrated in children with SCD for the first time. These data are important for future pediatric studies of the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in SCD.
30423563	Contrast-Enhanced Sonography in Patients with Hyposplenia: A Retrospective Analysis in Forty-Three Patients.	PURPOSE: In contrast to splenomegaly, the clinical value of a small spleen (hyposplenia) is unclear. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has not been investigated systematically in hyposplenia. METHODS: Between February 2005 and January 2017, 43 patients with hyposplenia (< 7 x 3 cm) were examined by B-mode ultrasound (US) and CEUS. A retrospective data analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 39 (91%) patients had an underlying disease (UD; allogenic stem cell transplantation, n = 16; autoimmune-diseases, n = 7; sickle cell anemia, n = 5; solid tumors, n = 5; others, n = 6). In 4 (9%) cases, hyposplenia was an incidental finding. The echogenicity of the spleen was normal (homogeneous, isoechogenic) in 17 (39.5%) and abnormal in 26 (60.5%) cases (inhomogeneous, n = 26 and hyperechoic, n = 9). In CEUS, 21 (49%) patients presented a normal isoenhancement. An abnormal enhancement was detected in 22 (51%) patients with UD (arterial/parenchymal inhomogeneous, n = 1; no [arterial, n = 3 and parenchymal, n = 6]; reduced [arterial, n = 8 and parenchymal, n = 15]). CONCLUSIONS: Hyposplenia is a rare pathologic finding and often associated with hematological/oncological and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, altered B-mode US appearance and a pathological CEUS pattern are frequently found. However, the clinical implication, especially regarding splenic function remains obscure to date.
32367470	[Pain management in sickle cell disease].	Sickle cell disease is associated with numerous symptoms and complications. Acute painful crisis is the most characteristic manifestation of the disease. In addition, many patients report chronic pain. As both acute and chronic pain severely diminish quality of life, adequate pain management is crucial. Recommendations for the treatment of acute painful crises are based on the World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which has been developed for cancer-related pain. Chronic pain can be treated with basic long-acting opioids and on-demand short-acting opioids. If patients show signs of neuropathic pain, administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants or possibly ketamine should be considered.
32202242	Proceeding of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress on sickle cell disease, 16-17 may 2019, Regensburg, Germany: What is the impact of antithymocyte globulin pharmacokinetics on haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation?	Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a widely accepted part of the conditioning regimen applied in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Although weight-based dosing of ATG has been introduced to optimize ATG dosing, substantial variance in clearance of active ATG, the actual lymphocyte binding component, remains a challenge. Therefore, further research regarding ATG pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in different HSCT settings and in patients with different types of underlying diseases is required.
29377292	Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficient red blood cell units are associated with decreased posttransfusion red blood cell survival in children with sickle cell disease.	Chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) reduces disease morbidity by suppressing the amount of circulating hemoglobin S (HbS)-containing red blood cells (RBC). The effectiveness of CTT depends on the rate of RBC clearance. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient donor RBC may exhibit increased hemolysis, but it is unknown if transfusion of these units results in less effective transfusion outcomes in SCD. Children with SCD on CTT were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. G6PD activity of transfused units was measured prior to expiration date. HbA clearance (DeltaHbA) was calculated as the difference of estimated posttransfusion HbA to the pretransfusion HbA of the subsequent transfusion episode. Sixty-two patients received 388 transfusions. Of 755 RBC units, 687 (91%) had normal G6PD (>60% activity), 38 (5%) had moderately low G6PD (10-60% activity), and 30 (4%) had severely low G6PD (<10% activity). Of 358 evaluable transfusions, 54 (15%) included >=1 G6PD deficient units, and 22 (6%) had >=1 severely deficient units. The proportion of the transfusion episode consisting of G6PD deficient units was associated with increased DeltaHbA for all G6PD deficient units (P = .05) and for severely G6PD deficient units (P = .0070). In multivariate mixed effects modeling, DeltaHbA was positively associated with severely G6PD deficient units (P = .0074) and RBC alloimmunization (P = .03) and negatively associated with recipient splenectomy (P = .015). Higher DeltaHbA was associated with higher HbS and reticulocyte counts at the subsequent transfusion episode. In conclusion, G6PD deficient RBC transfusions may have shorter in vivo survival and adversely affect the suppression of sickle erythropoiesis.
30029813	Current Evidence for the Use of Prophylactic Transfusion to Treat Sickle Cell Disease During Pregnancy.	The role of prophylactic transfusion therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease during pregnancy is unclear. An analysis of the existing literature shows a limited number of publications that address this issue and specifically compare clinical outcomes in this population based on a treatment strategy of prophylactic transfusion versus transfusion only for clinical indications (on-demand transfusion). The existing studies show a wide variation in study design and outcomes measured. The results of this analysis suggest that there are insufficient data to support a clinically significant difference in morbidity and mortality outcomes based on transfusion strategy. Additional prospective clinical studies need to be performed to adequately address the risks and benefits of prophylactic transfusion and guide clinical decision making.
29316596	van Neck-Odelberg Disease: A 3.5-Year Follow-Up Case Report and Systematic Review.	V an Neck-Odelberg disease (VND) is a benign skeletal overgrowth of the ischiopubic synchondrosis (IPS) in prepubescent patients. There is a paucity of long-term follow-up data and reviews on management decision-making. We report on a 15-year-old female, with a history of sickle-cell disease (HbSS), presenting with unilateral groin pain. Patient's physical examination, radiographs, and a literature-review determined a diagnosis of VND. Conservative treatment was issued. Clinical symptoms resolved at three months, followed by complete lesion resolution at three years. Additionally, a search of Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and OVID databases was performed. Reports including VND/IPS diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up decisions were identified. Systematic-review found 17 relevant articles, reporting on 29 patients. Patients presented with groin (51.7%) or buttock (20.7%) pain, and were diagnosed using X-ray (n=23) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=17). Twenty-five patients were treated conservatively, with two (8.0%) reports of surgical intervention. Average follow-up was 6.25 months. Our case report and systematic-review support conservative treatment for VND.
35373382	Beta-thalassemia and the advent of new interventions beyond transfusion and iron chelation.	Beta-thalassaemia, including sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia E, is most common in developing countries in tropical and subtropic regions. Because carriers have migrated there owing to demographic migration, beta-thalassaemia can now be detected in areas other than malaria-endemic areas. Every year, an estimated 300 000-500 000 infants, the vast majority of whom are from developing countries, are born with a severe haemoglobin anomaly. Currently, some basic techniques, which include iron chelation therapy, hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, splenectomy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are being used to manage thalassaemia patients. Despite being the backbone of treatment, traditional techniques have several drawbacks and limitations. Ineffective erythropoiesis, correction of globin chain imbalance and adjustment of iron metabolism are some of the innovative treatment methods that have been developed in the care of thalassaemia patients in recent years. Moreover, regulating the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A and sex-determining region Y-box through the enhanced expression of micro RNAs can also be considered putative targets for managing haemoglobinopathies. This review focuses on the biological basis of beta-globin gene production, the pathophysiology of beta-thalassaemia and the treatment options that have recently been introduced.

32224022	The Effect of Progressive Muscle Relaxation Exercises on Pain on Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Randomized Controlled Study.	PURPOSE: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on pain in patients with sickle cell disease. MATERIALS-METHOD: This randomized controlled interventional study was conducted in a hospital in Mersin, Turkey between October 2017 and July 2018. The study sample comprised 58 patients who were aged >18 years, conscious, had sickle cell disease, reported pain, and were treated with non-opioid or weak opioid analgesic based on the physician's recommendation (treatment group = 29, control group = 29). Data were collected by the individual presentation form and visual analog scale. During the study, both groups were treated with analgesics prescribed by the physician for three days. In addition to the analgesics, the treatment group was performed progressive muscle relaxation exercises for 30 minutes whereas the control group was rested. Pain level of both groups was evaluated at three time points every day for three days. In the study, frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were presented for categorical and numerical variables, respectively. Chi-square analysis, independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, three-way ANOVA, and Sidak test were used to analyze the difference between the variables. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 29.59 +- 6.94 years, and 53.4% of the patients were female and 69% were single. The mean pain score of the treatment group at the third time point on days 1, 2, and 3 was significantly lower than the control group (p < .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of coping methods for pain, pain location, and complaints accompanying pain (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation exercises were found to be effective in the pain management of patients with sickle cell anemia.
33648529	A comprehensive review of hydroxyurea for beta-haemoglobinopathies: the role revisited during COVID-19 pandemic.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in beta-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in beta-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of gamma-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.

31089288	Haploidentical CD3 or alpha/beta T-cell depleted HSCT in advanced stage sickle cell disease.	Despite significant improvements in the supportive care, sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative option, is limited due to matched donor availability. This could be met with T-cell-depleted haploidentical HSCT. Twenty advanced-stage SCD patients, median age 15 years, and 9 patients, median age 14 years, were transplanted with CD3/CD19- or TCRalphabeta/CD19-depleted grafts and from matched sibling donors (MSDs). The conditioning consisted of ATG, thiotepa, fludarabine, and treosulfan. The median follow-up in the T-haplo-HSCT and the MSD patients was 21 (9-62) and 25 (7-60) months, respectively. The OS in the T-haplo-HSCT and MSD was 90% and 100%, respectively. In the T-haplo-HSCT group, two patient succumbed to a CMV pneumonitis and a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). One patient in the T-haplo-HSCT group requires renal replacement therapy because of BK virus nephritis. None developed grade III-IV acute GvHD. In the T-haplo-HSCT and in the MSD, 20% and 22%, respectively, developed a mild or moderate chronic GvHD. These results demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of T-haplo-HSCT also for adult advanced stage SCD patients.

37309794	[What is your diagnosis? Inveterate anterior shoulder dislocation].	THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.
35934593	Effective therapies for sickle cell disease: are we there yet?	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic blood disorder associated with acute and chronic pain, progressive multiorgan damage, and early mortality. Recent advances in technologies to manipulate the human genome, a century of research and the development of techniques enabling the isolation, efficient genetic modification, and reimplantation of autologous patient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mean that curing most patients with SCD could soon be a reality in wealthy countries. In parallel, ongoing research is pursuing more facile treatments, such as in-vivo-delivered genetic therapies and new drugs that can eventually be administered in low- and middle-income countries where most SCD patients reside.
34191365	Further evidence for the benefit of therapeutic plasma exchange for acute multi-organ failure syndrome refractory to red cell exchange in sickle cell disease.	Acute multiorgan failure syndrome (MOFS) remains a significant cause of mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients despite red cell exchange (RCE). In small case series and reports, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has shown benefit in MOFS. As further support for consideration of this modality, we present two patients with SCD and MOFS refractory to RCE who were subsequently treated with TPE. Fresh frozen plasma was used as the replacement fluid. Despite estimated hospital mortality of 40% at the time of intensive care unit admission, both patients showed marked clinical improvement with TPE treatment. Our cases add to the evidence supporting the potential inclusion of MOFS secondary to acute SCD as an indication for TPE in the next edition of the American Society of Apheresis Guidelines on the Use of Therapeutic Apheresis in Clinical Practice.
35645211	Comparative evaluation of efficacy and safety of automated versus manual red cell exchange in sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exchange transfusion is a valuable treatment option in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is preferred over simple transfusion as it removes abnormal haemoglobin S (HbS) levels and reduces complications. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of automated red cell exchange (aRBX) procedure over manual red cell exchange transfusion (MET) in SCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standard meta-analysis protocol was developed, and after performing a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from nine relevant studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size calculated from the mean difference in HbS percentage, serum ferritin level and risk ratio for the adverse events. Quality assessment was done using the risk-of-bias assessment tool, and a summary of observations was prepared using standard Cochrane methodology with GradePro GDT. RESULTS: The random-model analysis revealed a mean difference of 4.10 (95% CI: -3.29-11.49; Z = 1.09; p = 0.28) for HbS percentage, mean difference of 435.29 (95% CI: -73.74-944.32; Z = 1.68; p = 0.09) for serum ferritin and pooled risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.63-2.87; Z = 0.77; p = 0.44) for adverse events. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis did not reveal any significant benefit of aRBX in reducing HbS percentage and attenuating the serum ferritin level when compared with MET. There was also no significant increased risk of adverse events detected in association with aRBX.
38506450	Post-transfusion biotin-labeled red blood cell survival studies in pediatric sickle cell disease with antibodies of uncertain significance.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) antibodies are common in multiply transfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Unlike RBC alloantibodies, the potential of autoantibodies to cause post-transfusion hemolysis may be uncertain. Biotin-labeling provides a direct measurement of red cell survival (RCS) over time, thus can be used to assess the clinical significance of RBC antibodies. Antibodies to biotinylated RBC (B-RBC) occasionally are detected after exposure, which may impact B-RBC survival in subsequent RCS studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusions underwent RCS studies, receiving aliquots of allogeneic RBC labeled at distinct densities of biotin (2-18 mug/mL). B-RBC survival was followed for 4 months post-transfusion, and B-RBC antibody screening for 6 months. Patients with warm autoantibodies (WAA) or B-RBC antibodies are reported here. RESULTS: RBC antibodies were detected during RCS in four patients: one with WAA, one with WAA followed by B-RBC-specific antibodies, and two with transient B-RBC antibodies within the first 5 weeks of exposure. B-RBC half-lives (T50 ) ranged 37.6-61.7 days (mean 47.8 days). There was no evidence of increased hemolysis or accelerated B-RBC clearance in the presence of WAA or B-RBC antibodies. DISCUSSION: Biotinylation of allogenic RBC can be used to assess the possible effects of RBC antibodies on transfusion survival in individual cases, particularly when it is uncertain if the detected antibodies may result in hemolysis. In the cases presented here, neither WAA nor B-RBC antibodies were associated with significant shortening of B-RBC survival in individuals with SCD.
31108496	Decreased Bleeding Incidence with Direct Oral Anticoagulants Compared to Vitamin K Antagonist and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Venous Thromboembolism.	BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a recognized complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet the optimal pharmacologic anticoagulant is unknown. METHODS: A retrospective single-institution cohort study of patients with SCD complicated by first VTE from January 2009 through July 2017 was performed using ICD 9/10 codes. Data collected included the anticoagulant used, VTE recurrence, and incidence of bleeding. RESULTS: 109 patients with VTE were identified. SCD genotypes included HbSS in 92 (84%), HbSC in 13 (12%), and HbS-beta+ thalassemia in 4 (4%). After the initial VTE event, 32 patients received a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), 34 for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and 43 for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). 16 patients (15%) experienced a clinically significant bleeding event, including 9 on VKA, 5 on LMWH, and 2 on DOACs. At a median follow-up of 11.8 (range, 3.4-60) months, 33 patients had a recurrent VTE, including 10 on VKA, 10 on LMWH, and 13 on DOACs (p = 0.833). Bleeding incidence was least with the DOACs, which were associated with fewer bleeding events (OR 0.22), and greatest with VKA (OR 1.55) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no difference between VTE recurrence and choice of anticoagulation in SCD patients with VTE. Bleeding events were lower for DOACs compared to VKA or LMWH.
30512127	Maternal/Perinatal Outcome in Women with Sickle Cell Disease: A Comparison of Two Time Periods.	OBJECTIVE: To compare pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle cell disease from recent deliveries with a similar group delivered earlier. METHODS: During a 12-year period (2005-2016), data from pregnant women with hemoglobin SS or SC were collected from three university medical centers and compared with earlier studies (1979-2003) involving similar patients. The primary endpoints were maternal complications during pregnancy and newborn outcomes. RESULTS: There were 278 patients in the control group (1979-2003) compared with 150 patients in the study group (2005-2016). Women in the study group were older (P < 0.0001) and of less parity (P =0.0001), and complications of preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and having a transfusion were similar between the two groups (P = 0.45, 0.95, and 0.49, respectively). Pain crises were more common in the study group (P = 0.02) as was cesarean section (P < 0.0001), but there was a reduction in pulmonary complications (P = 0.0002). Maternal mortality was uncommon (control group [N=4] vs study group [N=3], P = 0.40). Newborn statistics revealed a similar gestational age at delivery (37 weeks), and the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, as well as 5-minute Apgar score <7 did not differ by group (P = 0. 91, 0.85, and 0.16, respectively). Infants in the study group were heavier on average by approximately 220 g (P = 0.02), whereas the neonatal death rate was low (control group [N=1], study group [N=2] P = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: Recent pregnancy outcome statistics in women with sickle cell disease have not changed through the years. Innovative strategies to improve maternal and newborn outcomes among such patients are needed.
30270423	Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original Cochrane review first published in Issue 1, 2003, and previously updated in 2009, 2012 and 2014. Chronic pain, defined as pain that recurs or persists for more than three months, is common in childhood. Chronic pain can affect nearly every aspect of daily life and is associated with disability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to update the published evidence on the efficacy of psychological treatments for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents.The primary objective of this updated review was to determine any effect of psychological therapy on the clinical outcomes of pain intensity and disability for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents compared with active treatment, waiting-list, or treatment-as-usual care.The secondary objective was to examine the impact of psychological therapies on children's depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and determine adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: Searches were undertaken of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. We searched for further RCTs in the references of all identified studies, meta-analyses, and reviews, and trial registry databases. The most recent search was conducted in May 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs with at least 10 participants in each arm post-treatment comparing psychological therapies with active treatment, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control for children or adolescents with recurrent or chronic pain were eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials conducted remotely via the Internet. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed included studies and we assessed quality of outcomes. We combined all treatments into one class named 'psychological treatments'. We separated the trials by the number of participants that were included in each arm; trials with > 20 participants per arm versus trials with < 20 participants per arm. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed chronic pain conditions. We assessed the impact of both conditions on four outcomes: pain, disability, depression, and anxiety. We extracted data at two time points; post-treatment (immediately or the earliest data available following end of treatment) and at follow-up (between three and 12 months post-treatment). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 new studies (an additional 869 participants) in the updated search. The review thus included a total of 47 studies, with 2884 children and adolescents completing treatment (mean age 12.65 years, SD 2.21 years). Twenty-three studies addressed treatments for headache (including migraine); 10 for abdominal pain; two studies treated participants with either a primary diagnosis of abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome, two studies treated adolescents with fibromyalgia, two studies included adolescents with temporomandibular disorders, three were for the treatment of pain associated with sickle cell disease, and two studies treated adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, three studies included adolescents with mixed pain conditions. Overall, we judged the included studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias.Children with headache painWe found that psychological therapies reduced pain frequency post-treatment for children and adolescents with headaches (risk ratio (RR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 3.30, P < 0.01, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2.86), but these effects were not maintained at follow-up. We did not find a beneficial effect of psychological therapies on reducing disability in young people post-treatment (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.03), but we did find a beneficial effect in a small number of studies at follow-up (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.15). We found no beneficial effect of psychological interventions on depression or anxiety symptoms.Children with mixed pain conditionsWe found that psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment for children and adolescents with mixed pain conditions (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.19, P < 0.01), but these effects were not maintained at follow-up. We did find beneficial effects of psychological therapies on reducing disability for young people with mixed pain conditions post-treatment (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.15) and at follow-up (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.06). We found no beneficial effect of psychological interventions on depression symptoms. In contrast, we found a beneficial effect on anxiety at post-treatment in children with mixed pain conditions (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.03), but this was not maintained at follow-up.Across all pain conditions, we found that adverse events were reported in seven trials, of which two studies reported adverse events that were study-related.Quality of evidenceWe found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low, mostly downgraded for unexplained heterogeneity, limitations in study design, imprecise and sparse data, or suspicion of publication bias. This means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect, or we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; or the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments delivered predominantly face-to-face might be effective for reducing pain outcomes for children and adolescents with headache or other chronic pain conditions post-treatment. However, there were no effects at follow-up. Psychological therapies were also beneficial for reducing disability in children with mixed chronic pain conditions at post-treatment and follow-up, and for children with headache at follow-up. We found no beneficial effect of therapies for improving depression or anxiety. The conclusions of this update replicate and add to those of a previous version of the review which found that psychological therapies were effective in reducing pain frequency/intensity for children with headache and mixed chronic pain conditions post-treatment.
31567433	The controversial role of red cell transfusions for sickle cell pain.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Red cell transfusions are one of the most common and important therapies used for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). For prevention of strokes, there is abundant evidence that transfusions are efficacious, whereas for other indications, such as prevention of pain, there are less data. Nonetheless, with few therapeutic options, the use of transfusion for prevention of acute pain has increased in children and adults with SCD without a clear understanding of its benefits. RECENT FINDINGS: Although it makes conceptual sense that red cell transfusions would prevent pain that arises from vaso-occlusion, we now know that the mechanism of pain is more complex than vaso-occlusion alone. Recent taxonomies recognize a chronic pain syndrome that is both common in adults with SCD and affects the presentation of acute pain. It is not known if acute pain on the background of chronic pain responds differently to sickle cell therapies, such as hydroxyurea and blood transfusion. SUMMARY: In this review, we will examine the studies that have investigated whether red cell transfusions are efficacious for preventing pain. In the absence of high-quality data that specifically addresses this question, we will outline our approach, which might soon change with new drugs and curative therapies on the horizon.
33787937	Evidence for Prophylactic Transfusion during Pregnancy for Women with Sickle Cell Disease.	The objective of this study was to examine prior studies on maternal and neonatal outcomes with prophylactic compared with emergent blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease. A review of the literature was performed. Twenty-one articles were identified and included in the analysis. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the outcomes. Pregnancy outcomes assessed were preeclampsia, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, pain crises, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal death, perinatal death, and maternal mortality. Women who underwent emergent transfusion were more likely than women who underwent prophylactic transfusion to have the following adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR 2.04], 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.63), pneumonia (aOR 2.98, 95% CI 1.44-6.15), pain crises (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.38), and perinatal death (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06-3.07). Prophylactic transfusion should be reexamined as a potentially beneficial approach to the management of sickle cell disease in pregnancy.
32561028	Risk factors for hemolytic transfusion reactions resulting from ABO and minor red cell antigen incompatibility: From mislabeled samples to stem cell transplant and sickle cell disease.	Advances in laboratory testing, pathogen reduction and donor qualification have dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring an infection from a blood transfusion. Despite this progress, the most feared complication of transfusion - a hemolytic reaction due to incompatibility between donor and recipient - remains, with essentially no recent progress in the prevention or recognition of this rare but frequently lethal complication. Herein, the role that compatibility testing and transfusion practice play in the occurrence of acute hemolysis are described, with a special emphasis on clinical scenarios confer an increased risk of a severe hemolytic reaction in response to red blood cell or platelet transfusion. In addition, the signs and symptoms of a severe hemolytic reaction are summarized, along with the initial approach to clinical management.
29635754	The effect of iron chelation therapy on overall survival in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia: A systematic review.	Red blood cell transfusions have become standard of care for the prevention of life-threatening anemia in patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). However, frequent transfusions can lead to accumulation of iron that can result in liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Iron chelation therapy has been shown to reduce serum ferritin levels and liver iron content, but limitations of trial design have prevented any demonstration of improved survival. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the impact of iron chelation therapy on overall and event-free survival in patients with beta-thalassemia and SCD. Eighteen articles discussing survival in beta-thalassemia and 3 in SCD were identified. Overall iron chelation therapy resulted in better overall survival, especially if it is instituted early and compliance is maintained. Comparative studies did not show any significant differences between available iron chelation agents, although there is evidence that deferiprone is better tolerated than deferoxamine and that compliance is more readily maintained with the newer oral drugs, deferiprone and deferasirox. Iron chelation therapy, particularly the second-generation oral agents, appears to be associated with improved overall and event-free survival in transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassemia and patients with SCD.
30848512	Challenges in the treatment and prevention of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions with hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) are serious complications of RBC transfusion that can occur in previously alloimmunized patients. Patients who require episodic transfusions during heightened inflammatory states, such as patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), are particularly prone to alloimmunization and developing DHTRs with hyperhemolysis. While efforts to mitigate these hemolytic episodes via immunosuppressive drugs can be employed, the relative efficacy of various treatment options remains incompletely understood. CASE REPORTS: In this study, we explored five patients with SCD and multiple RBC alloantibodies who received various forms of immunosuppressive therapy in an attempt to prevent or treat severe DHTRs. RESULTS: The clinical course for these five patients provides insight into the difficulty of effectively treating and preventing DHTRs in patients with SCD with currently available immunosuppressive therapies. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, and the current literature, it is difficult to predict the potential impact of various immunosuppressive therapies when seeking to prevent or treat DHTRs. Future mechanistic studies are needed to identify the optimal treatment options for DHTRs in the presence or absence of distinct alloantibodies in patients with SCD.
36755516	An evaluation of deferiprone as twice-a-day tablets or in combination therapy for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in thalassemia syndromes.	INTRODUCTION: Regular blood transfusions in patients with thalassemia syndromes can cause iron overload resulting in complications including cirrhosis, heart problems, or endocrine abnormalities. To prevent iron overload toxicity in these patients, three iron chelators are currently FDA-approved for use: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. In the United States, deferiprone has been approved for three times daily dosing since 2011 and has recently gained approval for twice-daily administration. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed literature search was performed with the keywords 'deferiprone' and 'thalassemia.' Relevant original research studying deferiprone's effects on transfusional iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes was included. Exclusion criteria included case reports and review papers. Deferiprone is effective at reducing serum ferritin levels in patients with iron overload. Twice-daily administration provides a similar level of iron chelation as three times daily dosing with a comparable side effect profile and increased patient acceptability. EXPERT OPINION: New studies are highlighting deferiprone's potential for combination therapy with either deferoxamine or deferasirox to improve iron chelation. Deferiprone's ability to significantly decrease cardiac and liver iron content can be utilized in other transfusion-dependent hematologic conditions, as evidenced by its recent approval for use in the United States for sickle cell disease or other anemias.
29100558	Immunohaematological complications in patients with sickle cell disease after haemopoietic progenitor cell transplantation: a prospective, single-centre, observational study.	BACKGROUND: Haemopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation can cure sickle cell disease. Non-myeloablative conditioning typically results in donor-derived erythrocytes and stable mixed chimerism of recipient-derived and donor-derived leucocytes. Exposure to donor antigens from the HPC graft and new red cell antibodies induced by transfusion can lead to immunohaematological complications. We assessed the incidence of such complications among HPC transplant recipients with sickle cell disease. METHODS: The study population was all patients with sickle cell disease enrolled before March 31, 2015, in the three clinical trials of non-myeloablative HPC transplantation at the National Institutes of Health. We assessed formation of new red cell antibodies after transplantation and red cell incompatibility between donors and recipients. FINDINGS: 61 patients were enrolled, 42 were HLA matched and 19 were haploidentical. Nine (15%) had immunohaematological complications. Before HPC transplantation, three patients had antibodies incompatible with their donors. After HPC transplantation, new red cell antibodies were seen in six patients (11 alloantibodies and two autoantibodies), among whom three developed antibodies incompatible with donor or recipient red cells and three developed compatible antibodies. The clinical course of complications was highly variable, from no severe effects attributable to antibodies, to sustained reticulocytopenia, to near-fatal haemolysis. We found no significant correlation between immunohaematological complications and graft failure, graft rejection, or death. INTERPRETATION: Clinical effects ranged from seemingly not clinically important to potentially fatal. In patients with sickle cell disease, donor and recipient red cell phenotypes should be carefully assessed before transplantation to minimise and manage the risk of immunohaematological complications. FUNDING: Intramural Research Program and National Institutes of Health.
33509861	Diverse manifestations of a sickle cell crisis.	We describe the case of a 21-year-old man with a background of sickle cell disease (SCD) who was on acute presentation in a sickle cell crisis required immediate intensive care admission with red blood cell exchange and ventilatory support. He had right frontal lobe infarcts and extensive bilateral deep white matter lesions most likely secondary to fat embolism. Inpatient investigations demonstrated a patent foramen ovale, explaining the route of spread of the fat embolus. He then had a transcatheter closure of the atrial defect. The patient needed prolonged inpatient rehabilitation. He was discharged from hospital in a wheelchair secondary to severe lower limb neurology and bilateral knee heterotopic ossification. He lives with the possibility of early onset dementia and cognitive decline, requiring constant care. The case highlights the multiple manifestations of SCD and their diverse and debilitating consequences.
36353243	Fertility preservation for pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies: Multidisciplinary counseling needed to optimize outcomes.	Hemoglobinopathies are autosomal recessive disorders that occur when genetic mutations negatively impact the function of hemoglobin. Common hemoglobinopathies that are clinically significant include sickle cell disease, alpha thalassemia, and beta thalassemia. Advancements in disease-modifying and curative treatments for the common hemoglobinopathies over the past thirty years have led to improvements in patient quality of life and longevity for those who are affected. However, the diseases, their treatments and cures pose infertility risks, making fertility preservation counseling and treatment an important part of the contemporary comprehensive patient care. Sickle cell disease negatively impacts both male and female infertility, primarily by testicular failure and decreased ovarian reserve, respectively. Fertility in both males and females with beta thalassemia major are negatively impacted by iron deposition due to chronic blood transfusions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for SCD and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. Many of the conditioning regimens for HSCT contain chemotherapeutic agents with known gonadotoxicity and whole-body radiation. Although most clinical studies on toxicity and impact of HSCT on long-term health do not evaluate fertility, gonadal failure is common. Male fertility preservation modalities that exist prior to gonadotoxic treatment include sperm banking for pubertal males and testicular cryopreservation for pre-pubertal boys. For female patients, fertility preservation options include oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Oocyte cryopreservation requires controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with ten to fourteen days of intensive monitoring and medication administration. This is feasible once the patient has undergone menarche. Follicular growth is monitored via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and hormone levels are monitored through frequent blood work. Oocytes are then harvested via a minimally invasive approach under anesthesia. Complications of COH are more common in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome creates a greater risk to patients with underlying vascular, pulmonary, and renal injury, as they may be less able to tolerate fluids shifts. Thus, it is critical to monitor patients undergoing COH closely with close collaboration between the hematology team and the reproductive endocrinology team. Counseling patients and families about future fertility must take into consideration the patient's disease, treatment history, and planned treatment, acknowledging current knowledge gaps.
29796596	The Effects of a Single Electronic Music Improvisation Session on the Pain of Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: A Mixed Methods Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience acute pain that is multidimensional. Despite recent improvements in treatment, pain management remains a significant challenge for these individuals. Music therapy interventions have the potential to address several dimensions of SCD pain, but they require systematic investigation. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a single-session electronic music improvisation with a music therapist to diminish pain intensity and improve pain relief and mood in adults with SCD. METHODS: Using a three-group mixed methods intervention design, we randomized 60 adults with SCD to standard care plus one of three 20-minute study conditions: 1) electronic music improvisation with a music therapist (MT); 2) recorded music listening (ML); or 3) no intervention (control). Measures of pain intensity (VASPI), pain relief (VASPR), and mood (VASMOOD) were assessed before and after the study conditions, with a subset of MT and ML participants interviewed after measure completion. RESULTS: Compared to control, MT produced significant improvements in VASPI (odds ratio (OR) = 5.12, P = 0.035) and VASMOOD (OR = 11.60, P = 0.005). ML produced significant improvements in VASMOOD compared to control (OR = 5.76, P = 0.040). Qualitatively, there were two prominent themes directly related to music: 1) ML and MT offered many positive and few negative effects; and 2) music therapists provided comfort beyond the music. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings were promising and support the need for additional studies evaluating improvisational music therapy interventions for acute pain management in adults with SCD.
38066927	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for SCD has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of SCD.
34626014	Rare case of pyogenic hepatic abscess in a paediatric patient with sickle cell anaemia.	
31148158	Management of vaso-occlusive episodes in the day hospital decreases admissions in children with sickle cell disease.	Acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) are the most common reason for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient admission in people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). The goal of this study was to compare the hospital admission rate for VOE from our centre's day hospital (Pediatric Ambulatory Chemotherapy and Transfusion Unit; PACT) versus the ED, and to determine which factors influence admission rate. The study included a total of 370 visits involving 140 children with SCD with a mean age of 10 9 +- 5 5 years. The timing from triage to the first analgesic was significantly different between the PACT and the ED (median, 32 vs. 70 min, P < 0 0001). The initial choice of opioid dosage adhered to our centre's guidelines 84% of the time in the PACT v. 45% in the ED for morphine (P = 0 0003) and 100% in the PACT vs. 43% (P = 0 002) for hydromorphone. The admission rate from the ED (57%) was significantly higher than that of the PACT (29%) even when accounting for differences in baseline variables (P = 0 0001). In conclusion, the odds of being admitted were 3 8 times higher if the patient was treated in the ED. Timely administration and appropriate dosing of intravenous opioids may change this outcome in the future.
28578010	Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease Following Reduced-Intensity Conditioning: Results of a Phase I Trial.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from HLA-matched sibling donors results in disease-free survival of >90% in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD); however, only approximately 18% of these patients have suitable donors available. Unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is one way to expand donor options for patients with severe SCD, but historically has been associated with high graft rejection rates (50% to 62%). We hypothesized that the addition of thiotepa to a previously tested reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen would support engraftment after UCBT in patients with SCD. Nine children (age 3 to 10 years) with cerebrovascular complications of SCD underwent 5-6/6 HLA-matched (A, B, and DRB1 loci) UCBT after conditioning with hydroxyurea, alemtuzumab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan. A calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. With median follow up of 2.1 years (range, 1 to 4.2 years), 7 patients had sustained donor cell engraftment and are free of SCD, and 2 patients had autologous recovery. Acute GVHD (grade II-IV) and mild and moderate chronic GVHD developed in 3 patients, 2 patients, and 1 patient, respectively. At >2 years post-UCBT, 4 of 5 patients discontinued systemic immunosuppression. Seven patients had viral infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenovirus) and recovered. The 1-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 100% and 78%, respectively. Thus, this RIC regimen was able to achieve donor engraftment in the majority of patients. Future efforts will focus on further reducing rates of acute GVHD and viral infection.
31045326	Impact of a transition program with navigator on loss to follow-up, medication adherence, and appointment attendance in hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: Transition from pediatric to adult care is a period of high risk for loss to follow-up, morbidity, and mortality in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with hemoglobinopathies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a transition program with transition navigator (TN) reduced loss to follow-up and hospitalizations and improved medication adherence and appointment attendance compared with an unstructured transfer. PROCEDURE: A retrospective observational study compared all AYA with hemoglobinopathies who turned 18 one year prior to (n = 51) and one year after (n = 61) the initiation of the transition program. Data from one year prior to last pediatric appointment and one year following first adult appointment were collected from each patient. RESULTS: The transition program with TN reduced loss to follow-up from 29% to 7% (P = 0.034). A greater proportion of patients in the transition cohort maintained or improved adherence to hydroxyurea or iron chelation to >=4 days/week; exposure to the program was independently associated with such improvement (P = 0.047). A trend toward improvement or maintenance of >=90% attendance to appointments was observed (P = 0.096). Frequency of hospitalization was not significantly different between the two cohorts (P = 0.985). CONCLUSIONS: A transition program with TN significantly reduced loss to follow-up, and significantly improved and maintained fair to good medication adherence. Further analysis of economic benefit and patient satisfaction will be conducted.

34905048	Investigational curative gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease.	"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition resulting from abnormal hemoglobin production. It is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. The clinical manifestations are variable and range from recurrent acute and debilitating painful crises to life-threatening pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic complications. The only curative treatment of SCD at this time is bone marrow transplantation (also called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) using healthy blood stem cells from an unaffected brother or sister or from an unrelated donor if one can be identified who is a match in tissue typing. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients with sickle cell has such a donor available. The use of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and alternative types of genetic modifications is currently under study in clinical research trials for this disease. The approaches include the use of viral vectors to express globin genes that are modified to prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization or to express interfering RNAs to ""flip the switch"" in adult red cells from adult beta-sickle hemoglobin to fetal hemoglobin using a physiologic switch, and several gene editing approaches with the goal of inducing fetal hemoglobin or correcting/modifying the actual sickle mutation. In this audio review, we will discuss these different approaches and review the current progress of curative therapy for SCD using gene therapy."
37585480	Comparison of Thromboembolism Outcomes in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Prescribed Hormonal Contraception.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of thromboembolism (TE) and use of hormonal contraception can further increase that risk. This study aims to assess patterns of hormonal contraceptive use and compare risk of contraception-related TE between combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Patients with SCD between 12-44 years with a new prescription of a hormonal contraceptive in the CMS MAX database (2006-2018) were followed for one year. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of TE. We identified 7,173 new users: 44.6% initiated CHC and 55.4% initiated POC. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (36.5%) and progestin-only depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (33.9%) were the most frequently prescribed agents. A total of 1.8% of contraception users had a new diagnosis of TE within one year of first identified contraception prescription. There were no significant differences in TE event rates between CHC and POC users (17.2 and 24.7 events per 1000 person-years respectively, adjusted HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.58-1.21; p-value=0.336). In patients prescribed OCP, there were no differences in TE event rates based on estrogen dose or progestin generation. Transdermal patch had 2.4 fold increased risk of TE as compared to OCP. Although limited by the retrospective study design and use of administrative claims data, this study found no significant differences in TE rates between new users of CHC and POC in patients with SCD. Careful evaluation of underlying TE risk factors should be considered in each patient with SCD prior to initiation of hormonal contraception.
33254372	Fatal Brain Injury Following Carbon Dioxide Angiography.	INTRODUCTION: Carbon dioxide (CO2) as a contrast agent has been in use as early as the 1920s for visualization of retroperitoneal structures. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using CO2 as a contrast agent for vascular imaging was developed in the 1980s. Currently, CO2  angiography is an alternative agent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those who are at risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy. However, CO2 causes neurotoxicity if the gas inadvertently enters the cerebrovascular circulation leading to fatal brain injury. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old female with h/o sickle cell trait, hypertension, obesity, metastatic renal cell cancer status post nephrectomy, bone metastasis, chronic kidney disease was admitted for elective embolization of the humerus bone metastasis. Given the high probability of contrast-induced nephropathy, CO2 angiography was chosen for embolization of the metastasis. During the procedure, the patient became unresponsive. Emergent medical management with hyperventilation, 100% fraction oxygen inhalation was performed. Her neuroimaging showed global cerebral edema. An intracranial pressure monitor was placed which confirmed intracranial hypertension. Hyperosmolar therapy was administered with no improvement in clinical examination. She progressed to brain stem herniation. Given poor prognosis, the family opted for comfort measures and the patient expired. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Inadvertent carbon dioxide entry into cerebrovascular circulation during angiography can cause fatal brain injury. Caution must be exercised while performing CO2  angiography in blood vessels above the diaphragm.
28128037	Secondary Prevention of Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke.	This study aimed to know how frontline physicians in France, Belgium, and Switzerland implement guidelines regarding the secondary prevention of childhood arterial ischemic stroke and to introduce physicians' point of view on a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of aspirin as a preventive strategy. The authors conducted an online survey directed at specialists throughout dedicated networks and used a mixed method for data analysis. Overall, 63 physicians responded, and 88% prescribe aspirin when sickle cell disease, cardio-embolic stroke, and dissection of cervical arteries are excluded. Prescribing habits vary among respondents with respect to their specialty. A majority would choose placebo or a treatment given to historical controls to compare with an aspirin arm in a trial. In studied countries, there seems to be good adherence to guidelines regarding the secondary prevention of childhood stroke. A trial assessing the efficacy of aspirin could be well accepted if several factors regarding study design were taken into account.
30606035	Hydroxyurea can be used in children with sickle cell disease and cerebral vasculopathy for the prevention of chronic complications? A meta-analysis.	We conducted a systematic review for evaluating the impact of hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusion in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). A search was done in four databases from inception to 2017. Trials enrolling pediatric patients with SCD and cerebral vasculopathy with or without previous episode of stroke and that reported outcomes of occurrence of stroke and other events were included. Trained reviewers determined eligibility, risk of bias, and abstracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. We found that the primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke. We found two trials that recruited 254 patients. No difference was found for confirmed stroke occurrence (risk difference 0.04 [95% CI: -0.03 to 0.03]) and for new-onset neurological deficit (risk difference 0.11 [95% CI: -0.00 to 0.21]). Transfusions provided a significant lower risk of vaso-occlussive crisis (risk difference 0.10 [95% CI: 0.001 to 0.20]). Finally, transfusions provided a lower risk of having high concentrations of abnormal hemoglobin S (mean difference 37.94 [95% CI: 27.55 to 48.32]). As a conclusion, transfusions plus chelation therapy might be used instead of hydroxyurea in children with SCD. There is a lack of high-quality research in the care of children with SCD, and therefore a call for action is needed.

30626228	Successful Outcome of Hyperhemolysis in Sickle Cell Disease following Multiple Lines of Treatment: The Role of Complement Inhibition.	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a life-threatening complication in patients with sickle cell disease, characterized by difficulties in diagnosis and management. Certain reports have suggested successful salvage treatment with the terminal complement inhibitor, eculizumab. We here report evidence of complement activation and successful complement inhibition with one dose of eculizumab in an adult sickle cell disease patient presenting DHTR with hyperhemolysis. A 21-year old female sickle cell disease patient [Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/beta-thalassemia (beta-thal)] presented at our Adult Thalassaemia Unit, Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, with headaches, perioral numbness and pain in both antibrachia. The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of vaso-occlussive crisis (VOC) and treated symptomatically. On her third day of admission, due to hemoglobin (Hb) value of 6.9 g/dL with increase in reticulocytes, the patient was transfused with one unit of compatible leukodepleted red blood cells (RBC). The following day, hemolytic parameters increased, although Coombs, panel antibodies and screening tests were negative. Five days later, she again received a unit of RBCs, resulting in another increase of hemolytic parameters. During the following 2 days, there was a dramatic decrease of Hb levels to 5.4 g/dL with reticulocytes at 6.0%, negative Coombs testing and negative alloantibodies. Based on these findings, we recognized the syndrome of DHTR with hyperhemolysis. Given the lack of immediate access to other treatment, we administered intravenous rituximab, immunoglobulins and corticosteroids. As there was no response, one dose of eculizumab (900 mg) was then administered with ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis. The patient remains well 6 months post treatment.
33241734	Splenectomy in Jamaican children with sickle cell disease: Outcome of selective blood transfusion.	We reviewed the post-operative morbidity and mortality of open splenectomy undertaken in conjunction with selective blood transfusion in Jamaican children with sickle cell disease. Data were collected on 150 splenectomies performed between November 1994 and October 2017. Selective blood transfusion involved raising haemoglobin levels to approximately 100 g/L in patients with admission haemoglobin >=10 g/L below steady state. There was no mortality. Mean post-operative stay was 3.2 days with a median of three days. Total morbidity was 19/150 cases (12.7%), with acute chest syndrome accounting for 11/19 (57.9%). Among the non-transfused, acute chest syndrome occurred in 10/117 cases (8.5%), while among transfused, acute chest syndrome occurred in 1/33 cases (2.9%). We recommend this selective blood transfusion protocol for patients with sickle cell disease to surgeons who undertake splenectomies in settings where blood bank reserves are perennially low.
29280474	Anemia in Pregnancy: A Pragmatic Approach.	IMPORTANCE: Anemia is common in pregnancy, ranging from 5.4% in developed countries to more than 80% in developing countries. Anemia in pregnancy has been associated with prematurity, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This review uses clinical vignettes to illustrate the clinical presentations, approach to diagnosis, maternal and fetal implications, and treatment for the common etiologies of anemia in pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Literature review. RESULTS: Normal physiological changes in pregnancy result in alterations of hematological parameters particularly in a reduction of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Consequently, the Hb used to define anemia in pregnancy is lower than in nonpregnant patients. As there is an increased requirement of iron in pregnancy, it is not unexpected that iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia and warrants a preemptive approach to prevent a further reduction in Hb. The syndromes associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may pose a diagnostic challenge, as there are several potential etiologies that may be difficult to differentiate, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can be associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity andmortality. Anemia secondary to sickle cell disease and autoimmune hemolytic anemiamerit special attention because there are risks secondary to red blood cell transfusion and risks to withholding transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia in pregnancy is potentially associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Providing evidence-based care is essential to achieving the best pregnancy outcomes.
34487854	[Erythrapheresis in children with sickle cell disease, experience of a paediatric apheresis unit].	Erythrocyte exchanges on cell separators can be used in children with sickle cell disease and are effective in lowering the level of haemoglobin S. Of the 938 aphereses performed in 2020 in our unit, we observed a low rate of failure of procedures and few complications. Ninety-six percent of erythraphereses were performed in the context of chronic exchange programs, in more than 80% of cases for cerebral vasculopathy or after the occurrence of ischemic strokes. Less than 4% of the procedures were performed for specific indications (preparation for cholecystectomy most often). The vascular access is rarely an obstacle to the realisation of the apheresis. In case of insufficient venous capital, installing an arteriovenous fistula may be considered. Depending on the child's weight, haemoglobin level, and the severity of the sickle cell anaemia, precautions may be necessary when priming the procedure. Nurses experienced in paediatric apheresis and a good medical knowledge of sickle cell disease allowed us to use this technique from the age of 3years and the weight of 15kg.

28641096	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: The changing landscape.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD); however, its use is limited by lack of suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors and decreased application in older patients with significant morbidity. Myeloablative, HLA-identical sibling transplantation in children with SCD offers excellent long-term survival, with overall and event-free survival rates of 95% and 92%, respectively. However, the risk of graft-versus-host-disease, infections, infertility, and other long-term transplant complications, further limits its widespread use. Recent approaches using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) are associated with lower toxicity, allowing extension of this modality to children and adults with significant morbidity; however, these approaches are also associated with increased risk of graft failure. The optimal RIC regimen that strikes the optimal balance between maximizing the rate of stable engraftment while minimizing transplant-related morbidity and mortality is unknown. Alternative donor transplants, most prominently, partial HLA-mismatched related transplants (haploidentical), are being investigated with promising initial results. This review will discuss long-term results of HLA-matched sibling HSCT for SCD, and recent updates on HLA-matched unrelated donor and unrelated umbilical cord blood HSCT for SCD.
35724398	COVID19 vaccination in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated with increases in rates of pain crisis.	ABSTRACTPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are more vulnerable to hospitalization, pneumonia, and pain following COVID-19 infection. However, given the association between the inflammatory response and vaso-occlusive crises in SCD and a case report of vaso-occlusive crises following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCov-195-7/AstraZeneca vaccine, there is concern that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in people with SCD might provoke a vaso-occlusive crisis. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to examine acute care usage for vaso-occlusive crisis and frequency and severity of side effects following COVID-19 vaccination among patients at the Montefiore Sickle Cell Center for Adults. As part of regular care, patients were asked if they had received COVID-19 vaccination and any side effects were noted. Electronic medical records were reviewed for the type of vaccine, dates received, episodes of vaso-occlusive crises within seven days of a dose, and side effects noted. The risk of average hospital utilization per week in 2019 was calculated as a baseline. We found that fewer than 1 in 10 patients presented to the hospital within seven days of vaccination and that the risk of hospital utilization was similar to the average risk in a week in 2019. Of patients who reported side effects, one reported a possible case of sensorineural hearing loss otherwise no other rare side effects, including thrombosis or death, were reported.
28192225	A Randomized Trial of Yoga for Children Hospitalized With Sickle Cell Vaso-Occlusive Crisis.	CONTEXT: Sickle cell disease (SCD) vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) remains an important cause of acute pain in pediatrics and the most common SCD complication. Pain management recommendations in SCD include nonpharmacological interventions. Yoga is one nonpharmacological intervention that has been shown to reduce pain in some populations; however, evidence is lacking in children with VOC. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to compare the effect of yoga vs. an attention control on pain in children with VOC. The secondary objectives were to compare the effect of yoga vs. an attention control on anxiety, lengths of stay, and opioid use in this population. METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had a diagnosis of SCD, were 5-21 years old, were hospitalized for uncomplicated VOC, and had an admission pain score of >=7. Subjects were stratified based on disease severity and randomized to the yoga or control group. RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of patients approached (N = 73) enrolled on study. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical or demographic factors between groups. Compared with the control group, children randomized to yoga had a significantly greater reduction in mean pain score after one yoga session (-0.6 +- 0.96 vs. 0.0 +- 1.37; P = 0.029). There were no significant differences in anxiety, lengths of stay, or opioid use between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that yoga is an acceptable, feasible, and helpful intervention for hospitalized children with VOC. Future research should further examine yoga for children with SCD pain in the inpatient and outpatient settings.
28766838	Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis leading to severe hemolysis in two patients with sickle cell anemia.	The intracellular parasites Babesia microti and Babesia duncani can be transmitted by blood transfusion and cause severe life-threatening hemolytic anemia in high-risk patients, including those with sickle cell disease. The rarity of the diagnosis, as well as its similar clinical presentation to delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, may lead to a delay in diagnosis, as well as inappropriate treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents. The morbidity caused by this disease in especially vulnerable populations justifies the need for a universal blood-screening program in endemic areas.
29094192	Changes in Bi-ventricular Function After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant as Assessed by Speckle Tracking Echocardiography.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a therapeutic option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and severe acquired aplastic anemia (SAA). HSCT may have beneficial effects on ventricular function in damaged myocardium. We hypothesized improvement in ventricular performance and pulmonary hypertension following HSCT with strain echocardiography in SCD and SAA. Echocardiographic strain and other standard functional data were obtained via retrospective cohort analysis of patients (n = 23) with SCD and SAA who underwent HSCT and were followed at a single center between 2000 and 2014. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain was below normal at baseline, and decreased significantly (from - 16.6 to - 11.1, P = 0.05) from pre-HSCT to the initial post-HSCT echocardiogram at 109 (SD +- 83) days. At 351 (SD +- 115) days, longitudinal strain improved significantly from initial decline (from - 11.1 to - 17.5, P = 0.009) but was comparable to baseline (P = 0.43). Other measurements of bi-ventricular function did not change significantly. Tricuspid regurgitation velocities as surrogates for pulmonary hypertension improved in the subset of patients with baseline elevated values although data points were limited. Abnormal myocardial systolic function was detected at baseline with strain imaging. HSCT was associated with initial worsening longitudinal strain values, followed by improvement to baseline levels by 1 year. Insufficient data exist on whether pulmonary hypertension improves after HSCT.
28807656	Opportunities for model-based precision dosing in the treatment of sickle cell anemia.	Hydroxyurea is the primary pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA). Accumulated clinical experience across multiple age ranges has suggested that the use of an individualized maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will achieve optimal benefit of hydroxyurea treatment. However, the current empirical and trial-and-error approach for dose escalation often results in a lengthy titration process and is not strictly implemented in many clinics. Opportunities exist for pharmacokinetics model-based precision dosing of hydroxyurea to quickly achieve individual MTD. This review intends to introduce the use of a quantitative modeling approach including a Bayesian adaptive control strategy for the precision dosing of hydroxyurea. The rationale and practical considerations for the implementation of this approach are discussed. Future research directions with a focus on integrating specific safety and other clinical outcome endpoints into dose selection decision making are also discussed.
32520675	Advances in Sickle Cell Disease Treatments.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of red blood cells that is caused by a single mutation in the beta -globin gene. The disease, which afflicts millions of patients worldwide mainly in low income countries, is characterized by high morbidity, mortality and low life expectancy. The new pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for SCD is urgent in order to promote treatments able to reduce patient's suffering and improve their quality of life. Since the FDA approval of HU in 1998, there have been few advances in discovering new drugs; however, in the last three years voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and glutamine have been approved as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, new promising compounds have been described to treat the main SCD symptoms. Herein, focusing on drug discovery, we discuss new strategies to treat SCD that have been carried out in the last ten years to discover new, safe, and effective treatments. Moreover, non-pharmacological approaches, including red blood cell exchange, gene therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be presented.
29550053	Early initiation of inhaled corticosteroids does not decrease acute chest syndrome morbidity in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Systemic corticosteroids decrease ACS severity, but the risk of readmission for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) has limited their use. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as a safer alternative is currently unknown. An observational, historic cohort study compared patients with SCD with ACS who received ICS at admission (ICS) to those who did not (non-ICS). Outcome measures included rates of transfusion, oxygen requirement, BiPAP initiation, PICU transfer, intubation, readmission, hospital cost, and length of stay. One hundred twenty patients with SCD (55 non-ICS, 65 ICS) were included. A significantly higher proportion of the non-ICS group had bilateral infiltrates, but fewer had asthma. More children in the ICS group had BiPAP initiated, however transfer to the PICU, intubation, transfusion rates, oxygen requirement, hospital cost, length of stay, and readmission rates did not differ between groups. Regression analysis did not reveal any differences in outcomes, nor were outcomes changed when patients were separated based on the presence or absence of asthma. In this observational cohort study, ICS did not demonstrate a significant reduction in ACS morbidity, though ICS use should be studied in a prospective manner.
28682672	Sickle Cell Anemia and Comorbid Leg Ulcer Treated With Curative Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation.	Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are the only curative therapies for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Once the patients have successfully undergone transplantation and engrafted, the hallmark of hemolytic anemia resolves, and normal hemoglobin levels are achieved. Some transplant protocols exclude patients with open wounds, including leg ulcers, because of infection risks associated with transplantation and long-term immunosuppression required to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Recalcitrant and recurrent leg ulcers are a serious complication of SCD and a determinant of morbidity. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old man with sickle cell anemia and a chronic leg ulcer, who underwent PBSCT, engrafted successfully, and then had complete healing of his ulcer 16 months posttransplant.
29588281	When a transfusion in an emergency service is not really urgent: hyperhaemolysis syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease.	A 13-month-old boy with sickle cell disease (SCD) from Equatorial Guinea, who had recently arrived in Spain, presented with fever. He had suffered from malaria and had received a blood transfusion. Following physical examination and complementary tests, intravenous antibiotics and a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion were administered. Soon after a second transfusion 5 days later, the haemoglobin level fell below pretransfusion levels, together with reticulocytopenia, and haematuria-the so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome-requiring intensive care and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, with resolution of the complication. We want to emphasise the importance of suspecting this rare, though severe complication that can appear after any RBC transfusion especially in patients with SCD, as the clinical syndrome can simulate other more common complications of these patients and a further transfusion is contraindicated. There is no standardised treatment, but intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids are usually effective.
30376985	CRISPR in personalized medicine: Industry perspectives in gene editing.	While research in gene editing technology has been active since the 1990s, recent advances in CRISPR ease of use have sparked significant enthusiasm in the biomedical community. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) gene editing has the potential to shape the therapeutic landscape of genetically-defined diseases, with key players such as CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia, and Editas leading the way in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. In coming years, clinical development of CRISPR technology promises to change how we think about monogenic and polygenic diseases, though data is still in its infancy. While concerns regarding safety and administration of CRISPR persist and researchers are still seeking to better understand its effect on the body's ability to recognize and repair damaged DNA, the applications for personalized medicine are exciting and wide-ranging. This review examines potential applications of CRISPR for human therapeutics, with a private sector focus detailing anticipated clinical advances and evolving challenges along the way.
37205803	Current Evidence and Rationale to Guide Perioperative Management, Including Transfusion Decisions, in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.
37541536	Chronic Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Scoping Review of Controlled Trials.	Existing treatment for chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is opioid-dependent, which is ineffective and carries risks. We conducted a scoping literature review to assess the size and scope of available literature about controlled trials of therapies for SCD chronic pain and identify research gaps. The search strategy in PubMed and EMBASE utilized keywords for chronic pain and sickle cell and identified seven original articles that met inclusion criteria. Six of the studies recruited from clinics while one recruited from community sources. Cannabis and behavioral modification were associated with improvements in pain scores. However, existing evidence does not represent best practices for assessing chronic pain, and this along with small sample sizes prevents translation to clinical care. The limited evidence concerning treatment for SCD chronic pain highlights the need for larger trials of opioid alternatives and the utilization of chronic pain measures that capture nociplastic pain in SCD.
36782408	Malposition of the central venous catheter secondary to accessory hemiazygos vein variant.	A 36-year-old female with sickle cell disease presented with sickle cell pain crisis. After failure to establish peripheral venous access, an internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) was placed. Confirmation of internal jugular cannulation was performed with bedside ultrasound. A confirmatory chest X-ray revealed an unusual position of the catheter, taking a course inferiorly, making a loop and remaining on the left side of the mediastinum. A lateral view was done and revealed that the catheter passed inferiorly through the internal jugular vein then posteriorly and inferiorly giving the looped appearance. This is better delineated on a sagittal view CT scan showing the tip of the catheter terminating in the accessory hemiazygos vein. This unusual course is due to a variant of the accessory hemiazygos vein which is connected to the left superior intercostal vein. This creates a lower resistance pathway for the CVC which passes from the internal jugular vein, down the left superior intercostal vein (instead of the left brachiocephalic vein) and into the accessory hemiazygos vein. Discussion: The correct tip placement of an internal jugular CVC terminates in the superior vena cava just above the cardiac silhouette. In 1%-2% of individuals, a connection between the accessory hemiazygos and the left superior intercostal vein is present. Rare cases are discovered incidentally during CVC placement. The diameter of the accessory hemiazygos vein is less than half of that of the superior vena cava. The catheter should not be used as central venous access and removal is recommended. Malpositioning of central catheters is unpredictable but can be easily avoided by using intraprocedural methods to confirm tip position. Such modalities include intracavitary ECG or ultrasound with agitated saline injection as described in the SIC (Safe Insertion of Centrally Inserted Central Catheters) protocol.
33550421	Tolerance and humoral immune response to the yellow fever vaccine in sickle cell disease children treated with hydroxyurea: a multicentre prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) children are frequent travellers to countries where yellow fever (YF) is endemic, but there are no data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in such children treated with hydroxyurea (HU). The main objective of this study was to compare the tolerance and immune response to YF vaccination in SCD children treated or not with HU. METHOD: SCD children < 18 years attending the international travel clinics of three large paediatric centres and requiring a first YF vaccination were included in a prospective study. Adverse events were collected 2 weeks after vaccination. YF vaccine antibody titres were measured ~6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: Among the 52 SCD children vaccinated against YF, 17 (33%) were treated with HU. Only mild adverse events, mainly fever and local reaction, were observed in the HU group with a similar frequency in the non-HU group (57 and 35%, respectively, P = 0.30). YF antibody titres were measured in 15/17 patients in the HU group and 23/35 patients in the non-HU group after a median of 6.0 months (3.5-8.5) following vaccination. The geometric mean of YF antibody titre was similar in both groups. A protective antibody level was observed in 85% of the children in the HU group vs 100% in the non-HU group (P = 0.14), suggesting a lower effectiveness of the vaccine in patients on HU similarly to what has been described in patients on immune suppressive therapy for other vaccines. CONCLUSION: YF vaccination seems to be safe and efficient in SCD children treated with HU. Considering the potential risk of severe complications in cases of YF while travelling in Africa for those patients, the benefit-to-risk ratio argues for YF vaccination in all SCD children. Control of a protective antibody titre may also be useful to ascertain an adequate response in those treated with HU.
29553278	Patients discharged from the emergency department after referral for hospitalist admission.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) by hospitalist physicians. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study at a tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: We used consultation Current Procedural Technology codes to identify patients discharged from the ED after referral for hospitalist admission from April 2011 to April 2014. We report patient demographics and primary diagnoses. Main outcome measures included return to the ED, hospitalization, or mortality, all within 30 days. RESULTS: There were 710 discharges from the ED for 670 patients referred for hospitalist admission; 21.7% returned to the ED, 12.3% were hospitalized, and 0.4% died within 30 days. Chest pain was the most common diagnosis (38.2%); 18.1% of these patients returned to the ED within 30 days. Patients with the following 3 diagnoses returned to the ED most frequently: sickle cell disease (82.4%), alcohol-related diagnoses (43.5%), and abdominal pain (35.7%). In multivariate analysis, abdominal pain (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; P <.001) and alcohol dependence (OR, 3.1; P = .003) increased the odds of ED revisits, whereas syncope (OR, 0.23; P = .049) reduced the odds. Chest pain reduced the odds of hospitalization (OR, 0.37; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients discharged from the ED after referral for hospitalist admission did not return to the ED within 30 days, and the 30-day hospitalization rate was low. Our data suggest that hospitalists can safely aid patients by reducing the costs and adverse outcomes associated with unnecessary hospitalization.
28099398	"Utilizing a Novel Mobile Health ""Selfie"" Application to Improve Compliance to Iron Chelation in Pediatric Patients Receiving Chronic Transfusions."	Iron chelation therapy can prevent iron overload for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia major; however, adherence is suboptimal. Therefore, we developed an intensive training program (ITP), to improve medication management and disease knowledge. The objectives were to determine feasibility of the ITP and its preliminary impact on adherence, disease knowledge, and health outcomes. Pediatric patients were recruited to participate in the ITP over a 90-day period and were followed for 6 months. The ITP consisted of 3 components: (1) provider-led education modules; (2) patient recording daily videos of at-home medication administration; and (3) provider feedback through video messages through the ITP app. Eleven patients participated (mean=12.4 y). Initially, patients endorsed high satisfaction and ease of use and tracked their medication usage 81% (24 out of 30) of days. At 90 days, adherence rates remained consistent (80%) and disease knowledge retention was high (96%). At 6 months, participants exhibited a clinically relevant decrease in serum ferritin, which trended toward statistical significance (P=0.068). Medication possession ratio did not significantly increase (0.65 to 0.72; not significant). The mobile ITP was feasibly implemented in a clinical setting; in addition, high levels of compliance, disease knowledge retention, and acceptance encourage larger studies evaluating mobile health technology to improve child health parameters.
34956203	Long-Term Effects of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation on Systemic Inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only currently available curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the effects of HSCT on SCD pathophysiology are poorly elucidated. Here, we assessed red blood cell (RBC) adhesiveness, intensity of hemolysis, vascular tone markers and systemic inflammation, in SCD patients treated with allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-two SCD patients were evaluated before and on long-term follow-up after HSCT. Overall survival was 94% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host disease and a 22% rejection rate (graft failure). Hematological parameters, reticulocyte counts, and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), endothelin-1 and VCAM-1 normalized in SCD patients post-HSCT. Expression of adhesion molecules on reticulocytes and RBC was lower in patients with sustained engraftment. Levels of IL-18, IL-15 and LDH were higher in patients that developed graft failure. Increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNF-alpha, were found in SCD patients long-term after transplantation. SCD patients with sustained engraftment after allo-HSCT showed decreased reticulocyte counts and adhesiveness, diminished hemolysis, and lower levels of vascular tonus markers. Nevertheless, systemic inflammation persists for at least five years after transplantation, indicating that allo-HSCT does not equally affect all aspects of SCD pathophysiology.
33128443	Emergence of gram-negative organisms as the cause of infections in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease are at higher risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria due to immature immune responses and functional asplenia. We aimed to study our patient population for the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis and document a vast decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia rates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 158 patients with sickle cell disease registered at our hospital. Over a period of 13 years, every patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with fever had their medical record reviewed for blood cultures, wound cultures, and magnetic resonance imaging results for osteomyelitis. RESULTS: The number of patients presenting to the ED with fever was 105, with 581 febrile episodes and 893 blood cultures. Among those, no culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 grew coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.5%), one grew Salmonella enterica Paratyphi B, and three grew Salmonella enterica group C (in the same patient). The total number of osteomyelitis episodes in patients with sickle cell disease presenting with fever and documented by imaging was nine (1.5%). In patients with osteomyelitis, organisms were isolated in four patients (44%), including Enterobacter cloacae, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica group C. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and the use of prophylactic penicillin has virtually eliminated pneumococcal bacteremia among our patients. We observed the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.
36210501	An Overview of Solid Organ Transplantation in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder affecting >300 000 people across the world. The vast majority of patients cared for in high-resource settings live well into adulthood, but many develop a high burden of disease complications. Good standard of care including disease-modifying agents and transfusion programs limits the number of patients who develop end-stage organ disease, but for those that do, the prognosis can be very poor. Solid organ transplantation is a well-established mode of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and kidney or liver failure, but appropriate patient selection and perioperative management are important for achieving good outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy may offer novel treatment options for adult patients with chronic organ damage in the future, but these are not yet widely available. For now, good, holistic care and early intervention of end-organ complications can minimize the number of patients requiring solid organ transplantation later in life.
36123234	Editing human hematopoietic stem cells: advances and challenges.	Genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is being developed for the treatment of several inherited disorders of the hematopoietic system. The adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9-based technologies to make precise changes to the genome, and developments in altering the specificity and efficiency, and improving the delivery of nucleases to target cells have led to several breakthroughs. Many clinical trials are ongoing, and several pre-clinical models have been reported that would allow these genetic therapies to one day offer a potential cure to patients with diseases where limited options currently exist. However, there remain several challenges with respect to establishing safety, expanding accessibility and improving the manufacturing processes of these therapeutic products. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in the field of genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and illustrates the ongoing challenges.
38130071	Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion in chronically transfused adults.	BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units mitigates severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, washing reduces the time to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive. A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for washed RBC for patients previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select patients with prior requirements for washing, due to a history of allergic transfusion reactions, trials of unwashed transfusions were performed. Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline, and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 34 years interquartile range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These patients had been transfused with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per patient over 12 years (IQR 5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one patient with one episode of pruritus and another with recurrent pruritus, which was typical even with washed RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104 +- 10 vs. 28.2 +- 25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.
32124977	Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain management in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited disorders, is associated with vaso-occlusive pain episodes and haemolysis leading to recurrent morbidity, hospital admissions and work or school absenteeism. The crises are conventionally treated with opioids, non-opioids and other adjuvants with the risk of developing complications, addictions and drug-seeking behaviour. Different non-pharmacological treatments, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have been used for managing pain in other painful conditions. Hence, the efficacy of TENS for managing pain in SCD needs to be reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD who experience pain crises or chronic pain (or both). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the last search: 26 Febraury 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, where TENS was evaluated for managing pain in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified by the literature searches according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors then independently extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane standard tool and rated the quality of evidence using the GRADE guidelines. MAIN RESULTS: One double-blind cross-over RCT with 22 participants with SCD (aged 12 to 27 years) was eligible for inclusion. Following stratification into four pain crises severity grades, participants were then randomised to receive TENS or placebo (sham TENS). The trial was concluded after 60 treatment episodes (30 treatment episodes of each treatment group). There is a lack of clarity regarding the trial design and the analysis of the cross-over data. If a participant was allocated to TENS treatment for an episode of pain and subsequently returned with a further episode of a similar degree of pain, they would then receive the sham TENS treatment (cross-over design). For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear whether they were re-randomised or given the alternate treatment. Reporting and analysis was based on the total number pain events and not on the number of participants. It is unclear how many participants were crossed over from the TENS group to the sham TENS group and vice versa. The trial had a high risk of bias regarding random sequence generation and allocation concealment; an unclear risk regarding the blinding of participants and personnel; and a low risk regarding the blinding of the outcome assessors and selective outcome reporting. The trial was small and of very low quality; furthermore, given the issue with trial design we were unable to quantitatively analyse the data. Therefore, we present only a narrative summary and caution is advised in interpreting the results. In relation to our pre-defined primary outcomes, the included trial did not report pain relief at two to four weeks post intervention. The trial authors reported that no difference was found in the changes in pain ratings (recorded at one hour and four hours post intervention) between the TENS and the placebo groups. In relation to our secondary outcomes, the analgesic usage during the trial also did not show any difference between groups. Given the quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to sham TENS. The ability to cope with activities of daily living was not evaluated. Regarding adverse events, although one case of itching was reported in the TENS group, the site and nature of itching was not clearly stated; hence it cannot be clearly attributed to TENS. Also, two participants receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since we have only included one small and very low-quality trial, with a high risk of bias across several domains, we are unable to conclude whether TENS is harmful or beneficial for managing pain in people with SCD. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, RCT to evaluate the role of TENS in managing pain in people with SCD.
32722787	Curative vs targeted therapy for SCD: does it make more sense to address the root cause than target downstream events?	Sickle cell disease (SCD) places a heavy burden on a global and increasing population predominantly resident in resource-poor and developing countries. Progress continues to be made in preventing childhood mortality, and increasing numbers of chronically ill adults with disease are requiring care for disease sequelae. Curative therapies for SCD are therefore attractive to physicians and investigators focused on SCD. Gene therapies are being developed, and several are now in various stages of early-phase human clinical trials. However, we must also pursue avenues through which we can do the most good for the most people alive today. Such efforts include improving our understanding of disease mechanisms and which disease sequelae most strongly affect survival and interfere with quality of life. The pathways leading to disease sequelae are multiple, complex, and highly interactive. Four drugs have now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for SCD; however, each has a distinct mechanism and a measurable but limited effect on the many clinical sequelae of SCD. We therefore need to learn how to approach multi-agent therapy for SCD. The order of addition of each agent to treat a specific patient will need to be guided by response to previous therapy, risk factors identified for specific disease outcomes, and clinical studies to determine more comprehensively how the 4 currently approved drugs might interact and produce (or not) additive effects. Moreover, this will have to be accomplished with defined end points in mind, according to which pose the greatest threats to quality of life as well as survival.
29749702	Management of severe chronic pain with methadone in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	Vasocclusive pain crises are common among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Some patients with repeated pain crises develop chronic pain. We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with SCD with chronic pain treated with methadone. We identified a significant reduction in pain hospitalizations following methadone treatment (0.35 +- 0.19 vs. 0.19 +- 0.17 hospitalizations/month, P = 0.016). In addition, we did not observe overt organ toxicity nor symptoms of opioid withdrawal during methadone wean. We suggest that methadone is safe and has some clinical benefit, which should be proven in prospective randomized trials for pediatric patients with SCD and chronic pain.

34889358	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now?	The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.
33941871	Successful mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for pediatric hemoglobinopathy by using ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide.	The use of HLA-mismatched (un)related donors is historically associated with a higher incidence of transplant-related complications and mortality. However, the use of such donors may overcome the limited availability of HLA-matched donors for patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). We investigated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcomes of pediatric TM and SCD patients treated with a mismatched donor using a treosulfan-based conditioning in combination with ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) and compared these results to the clinical outcome of patients treated by matched donor HSCT without PT-CY. Thirty-eight children (n = 24 HLA-identical or 10/10-matched donors; n = 14 HLA-mismatched donors), who received a non-depleted bone marrow graft were included. Event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD were not higher in the mismatched PT-Cy group as compared to the matched group. Moreover, despite delayed neutrophil engraftment (day +22 vs. +26, p = 0.002) and immune recovery in the mismatched PT-Cy group, this did not result in more infectious complications. Therefore, we conclude that in the absence of an HLA-identical or a matched unrelated donor, HSCT with a mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor in combination with ATG plus PT-CY can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for pediatric hemoglobinopathy patients.
28426137	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, in particular that of pain, by raising fetal haemoglobin. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hydroxyurea therapy in people with SCD (all genotypes), of any age, regardless of setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries.Date of the most recent search: 16 January 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, of one month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo, standard therapy or other interventions for people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified in the searches; eight randomised controlled trials were included, recruiting 899 adults and children with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin Sbetaothalassaemia (HbSbetaothal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months.Four studies (577 adults and children with HbSS or HbSbetaothal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo; three recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited individuals with all disease severities. There were statistically significant improvements in terms of pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use), measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts and fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups. There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). Seven deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by treatment group were not statistically significantly different.Two studies (254 children with HbSS or HbSbetaothal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) compared hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to transfusion and chelation; there were statistically significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts, but more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group. There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of pain alteration and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). Two deaths occurred during the studies (one in a the hydroxyurea treatment arm and one in the control arm), but the rates by treatment group were not statistically significantly different. In the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was terminated early.The quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons were mostly large and well designed (and at low risk of bias); however evidence was limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse events and results are applicable only to individuals with HbSS and HbSbetaothal genotypes.Of the remaining two studies, one (22 children with HbSS or HbSbetaothal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation; there were statistically significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events).The final study (44 adults and children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea - there was statistically significant improvement in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin, but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). No participants died in either of these studies and other outcomes relevant to the review were not reported.The quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged to be very low due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (as both studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and genotypes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbSbetaothal genotypes and in preventing life-threatening neurological events in those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining transcranial doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly in preventing chronic complications of SCD, recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with HbSC genotype. Future studies should be designed to address such uncertainties.

37914454	SCULP study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the pain of sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLU).	BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers associated with major sickle cell disease (SCLU) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in SCLU is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the pain and healing of SCLU. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for SCLU skin grafting were included in a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53 autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 sickle cell patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96% of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic effect in the management of patients with SCLU, and significantly notice reduction of wound surface area within one month.
31808832	Optimal disease management and health monitoring in adults with sickle cell disease.	In countries with access to organized health care, survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has greatly improved, resulting in a growing population of adults with SCD. Transition from pediatric to adult care presents many challenges for the patient, who now faces the reality of emerging complications in many organs that are cumulative, adding to other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact and add to the disease morbidity. We recommend regular comprehensive annual assessments, monitoring for early signs of organ damage and joint clinics with relevant specialists, if applicable. While maintaining a low threshold for intervention with disease-modifying therapies, we should always keep in mind that there is no single complication that is pathognomonic of SCD, and nonsickle comorbidities should always be excluded and treated if present. We need to reevaluate our approach to managing adults with SCD by putting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary care while proactively considering curative options (hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) and experimental pharmacological agents for adults with SCD of all ages before complications render the patients ineligible for these treatments.
36069257	Iron Chelators, Such as Deferasirox, When Combined With Hydroxyurea, Provide an Additional Benefit of Iron Chelation in Patients Receiving Chronic Transfusion Therapy.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have been established as one of the primary therapies in treating sickle cell anemia. However, they are not free of side effects, with overloading the body with iron being one of the most important. Iron chelation therapy greatly reduces the iron load of the body. In addition, hydroxyurea (HU), an oral chemotherapeutic drug also has a significant role in the treatment of the disease with beneficial effects on many of the clinical problems that arise, mainly in reducing painful crises. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of synergistic transfusion therapy and HU on the response to deferasirox (DFX) chelation therapy. Eighteen patients with sickle cell disease were divided into two groups based on their treatment, either with simple transfusions and DFX or with a combination of transfusion therapy, DFX and HU, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for liver iron concentration (LIC) and biochemistry. All patients completed the study. The results of the study showed improvement in serum ferritin (FER) levels and LIC after 12 months of therapy in both groups, especially in the group receiving the combination therapy with HU. In addition, there was a noteworthy improvement in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with serum creatinine (Cr) levels remaining stable during the study in both groups. Hydroxyurea, when combined with iron chelators such as DFX, provides an additional benefit of iron chelation in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy.
35385685	Of mice and men: From hematopoiesis in mouse models to curative gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	Through studies in mice and in humans, Stuart Orkin showed that GATA-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis. He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin's contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease.
37839398	Don't add fuel to the fire- Hyperhemolysis Syndrome in a pregnant woman with compound Sickle cell disease/ss0-thalassemia - Case report and review of the literature.	Hyperhemolysis Syndrome (HHS) is a rare and severe post-transfusion complication characterized by the destruction of both recipient and donor red blood cells (RBC). The underlying mechanism of HHS is not fully understood and proper management can be difficult. Furthermore, there are few reports regarding HHS in pregnancy. We report on the development and management of HHS in a pregnant woman with known compound Sickle cell disease/ss-0-thalassemia after transfusion of not fully compatible packed red blood cells (PRBC). We aim to raise awareness on this diagnostically challenging and life-threatening type of hemolysis with this report, and to stress the need to consider the diagnosis of HHS in SCD patients with progressive anemia despite PRBC administration.

33941758	COVID-19 Presentation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Certain health conditions have been proven to have an effect on the severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-COV-2. The list of identified comorbid conditions includes hematological diseases, with sickle cell disease (SCD) falling into this category. CASE REPORT This case series examines the history, presentation, and clinical course of 5 patients with SCD who tested positive for SAR-COV-2 during the spring and summer of 2020. These patients experienced COVID-19 severities ranging from a mild cough and congestion to 8-day hospitalizations requiring blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS While there is still a great amount of research on the interaction between COVID-19 and SCD needed, from this study we have concluded that patients with SCD do not always present with the classic COVID-19 triad of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Often, these patients present with symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), including severe leg, flank, and chest pain, as was seen in 4 of 5 of our patients. We, and several other researchers, believe that this association between COVID-19 and VOC could be due to COVID-19 triggering inflammatory cytokines (notably IL-6) leading to system-wide inflammation, which induces sickling of the red blood cells. Based on this report, we recommend that SCD patients presenting with VOC who have had exposure to SAR-COV-2 be promptly tested for SAR-COV-2 to guide treatment and reduce mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable population.
28295188	How we manage iron overload in sickle cell patients.	Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.
30179992	Catastrophic Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease Without Alloantibodies: Case Report and Review of Literature.	While packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of certain patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and the standard of care for preoperative management, there are associated risks. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a risk of PRBC transfusion occurring 2 to 20 days from transfusion and typically presents with severe pain characteristic of vaso-occlusive crisis, fever, and hemolytic anemia. DHTRs are uncommon, occurring in only 4% to 11% of transfused patients with SCD, but may be catastrophic in nature with progression to multiorgan failure within hours. Here, we describe a case of a 20-year-old female with sickle cell SS disease who developed a severe DHTR 5 days following an elective preoperative PRBC transfusion, and rapidly progressed to multiorgan failure and death. This is the first reported case of a catastrophic DHTR in a patient with SCD without any detectable known or new alloantibodies.
33189570	Red blood cell exchange in an emergency in sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell exchange (RBCEx) has become a standard therapy to remove abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In the last few decades, numerous RBCEx procedures have been performed chronically during regular programs, while numerous procedures have also been performed in an emergency for several indications, this therapeutic option being very efficient in vital and emergency situations. In both groups of indications, large amounts of sickle RBCs have to be removed, which requires great precision and the setting of specific hematological targets. The aim of this review is to discuss the aims, clinical and biological targets, and the requirements and precautions when performing RBCEx in an emergency. Moreover, we analyze how improvement of the techniques as well as the clinical and biological targets has led to optimization of the procedures in emergency settings. We also consider the outstanding issues that require additional investigation.
32577055	Laparoscopic Splenectomy in Children: Safety of Ligasure Usage.	INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic splenectomy started to be more popular and nowadays it is the first choice for splenectomy in children. The main advantages of laparoscopic splenectomy over open approach are the shorter hospital stay, low complications and the cosmetic results despite the main concern of long operative time and the intra operative bleeding. AIM: The aim of this study was to report our experience with laparoscopic splenectomy in children's with hematological diseases using ligasure regarding vascular control safety, efficacy and complications rate. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at Queen Rania Al-Abdullah Hospital for Children over the period from January 2017 to February 2019. Total number of 18 patients with hematological diseases underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using ligasure. Demographic data, complications and outcomes were collected to assess the advantages of ligasure usage for vascular control safety. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using ligasure (10 with spherocytosis, 4 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], 3 with sickle cell anemia, 1 with hemangioma), from which number, 8 patients were males and 10 were females. Mean age was 6.7 years (ranges from 4.3 to13.7 years). Mean operative time was 107 minutes (ranges from 70-180 minutes). There was no conversion to open splenectomy and no mortality. Intra operative blood loss was insignificant. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic splenectomy using ligature is safe with excellent results in decreasing operative time, less complications and decrease incidence of intraoperative bleeding.
31364883	New and emerging treatments for vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease.	Introduction: Acute pain from episodic vaso-occlusion (VOC) spans the lifespan of almost everyone with sickle cell disease (SCD), while additional chronic pain develops in susceptible individuals in early adolescences. Frequent acute pain with chronic pain causes significant physical and psychological morbidity, and frequent health-care utilization. Available pharmacologic therapies reduce acute pain frequency but few evidence-based therapies are available for chronic pain. Areas covered: An extensive PubMed literature search was performed with appropriate search criteria. The pathophysiology of acute pain from VOC in SCD is very complex with many events subsequent to sickle polymer formation. Sensitization of pain pathways and alterations of brain networks contributes to the experience of chronic pain. Numerous therapies targeting putative VOC mechanisms are in clinical trials, and show considerable promise. Alternative analgesic treatments for acute and chronic pain have been examined in small patient cohorts, but formal clinical trials are lacking. Expert opinion: Childhood is likely a critical window for prevention of acute and later chronic pain. New multimodal analgesic therapies are needed, particularly for chronic pain, and should be examined in clinical trials. Given the multifactorial nature of both pain and VOC, simultaneously targeting multiple mechanisms may be the optimal approach for effective preventive therapies.
34786695	A randomised controlled provider-blinded trial of community health workers in sickle cell anaemia: effects on haematologic variables and hydroxyurea adherence.	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) (HU) for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is underutilised. Case management is an evidence-based health management strategy and in this regard patient navigators (PNs) may provide case management for SCA. We hypothesised that HU-eligible patients exposed to PNs would have improved indicators of starting HU and HU adherence. We randomised 224 HU-eligible SCA adults into the Start Healing in Patients with Hydroxyurea (SHIP-HU) Trial. All patients received care from trained physicians using standardised HU prescribing protocols. Patients in the Experimental arm received case management and education from PNs through multiple contacts. All other patients were regarded as the Control arm and received specialty care alone. Study physicians were blinded to the study arms and did not interact with PNs. At baseline, 6 and 12 months we assessed and compared laboratory parameters and HU adherence indicators. Experimental patients had higher 6-month mean fetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels than controls. But at 12 months, mean HbF was similar, as were white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, total haemoglobin, platelet count and mean corpuscular volume. At 12 months there were fewer experimental patients missing HU doses than controls (mean 1 8 vs. 4 5, P = 0 0098), and more recent HU prescriptions filled than for controls (mean 53 8 vs. 92 days, median 27 5 vs. 62 days, P = 0 0082). Mean HU doses were largely similar. We detected behavioural improvements in HU adherence but no haematological improvements by adding PNs to specialty care.
33251574	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal haemoglobin polymerisation leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are: - to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease; - to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries, Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.

36965115	Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: The relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission.	Data on acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study, we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes (time to onset <=24 h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (>24 h, 58%; median [interquartile range] time to onset: 2 [2-3] days). The median age was 27 [22-34] years, 89% of the patients had an S/S or S/beta0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had a history of ACS (median: 3 [2-5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively 54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for 20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.
34530179	Low Rates of Cerebral Infarction after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease at High Risk for Stroke.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients with cerebrovascular disease are often referred for HSCT. The objective of this study was to describe neurologic outcomes after HSCT in patients with pre-existing SCD and cerebrovascular comorbidity. Patients with SCD treated with HSCT at a single center between 1996 and 2019 were identified. Patients with cerebral ischemia and/or vasculopathy before undergoing HSCT were included. Patients with graft failure were excluded. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: symptomatic stroke, vasculopathy without symptomatic stroke, and isolated silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Magnetic resonance imaging/angiography and neurologic assessments pre- and post-HSCT were analyzed to assess outcomes. In a cohort of 44 patients, there were 25 with symptomatic infarction, 10 with vasculopathy, and 9 with isolated SCI. Post-HSCT ischemic injury (2 symptomatic strokes, 2 SCIs) was identified in 4 patients, all with previous symptomatic infarction. Within this group (n = 25), the post-HSCT incidence of subsequent symptomatic infarction was 1.6 events/100 patient-years, and SCIs occurred at a rate of 2.2 events/100 patient-years. No patient had progression of vasculopathy post-HSCT. Our data show a low incidence of new ischemic injury after successful HSCT for SCD. Patients with a history of both symptomatic stroke and vasculopathy are at greatest risk for post-HSCT ischemic injury.
31722835	[A review of avascular necrosis, of the hip and beyond].	Avascular necrosis is an ischemic or cytotoxic necrosis of epiphyseal bone, responsible for joint pain, altered life quality and frequently affecting young patients. Avascular necrosis can be unifocal or multifocal, underlining the possibility of a systemic origin. Avascular necrosis involves the femoral head in more than 75% of cases. Although avascular necrosis is irreversible, many risk factors must be sought, including corticosteroid treatment, hypercholesterolemia, sickle cell disease or alcohol abuse. MRI imaging is the main exploration for the diagnostic and staging of the disease, and should be performed in unexplained hip pain in young patients with normal X-rays. In the earlier stages of the disease (stage I and II of the Arlet and Ficat classification), joint surface is preserved, and conservative treatment is recommended. In the more advanced stages (III and IV of the Arlet and Ficat classification), the articular surface collapses and joint arthroplasty is the main treatment. However, there are some recent therapeutic advances, based on mesenchymal stem cells, which may contribute, in the future, to improve the bad functional prognosis of the disease.
29356722	Early Noninvasive Ventilation and Nonroutine Transfusion for Acute Chest Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease in Children: A Descriptive Study.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the need for transfusion and short- and long-term evolutions of pediatric sickle cell disease patients with acute chest syndrome for whom early continuous noninvasive ventilation represented first-line treatment. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective chart study in PICU. SETTING: A tertiary and quaternary referral PICU. PATIENTS: All sickle cell disease patients 5-20 years old admitted with confirmed acute chest syndrome and not transfused in the previous month were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, laboratory and radiologic findings, transfusions, invasive ventilation, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation settings, duration of opioid treatment, length of hospital stay, and severe sickle cell disease complications in the ensuing 2 years were extracted from medical charts. Sixty-six acute chest syndrome in 48 patients were included. Continuous early noninvasive ventilation was well tolerated in 65 episodes, with positive expiratory pressure 4 cm H2O and pressure support 10 cm H2O (median) administered continuously, then discontinued during 7 days (median). No patient necessitated invasive ventilation or died. Twenty-three acute chest syndrome (35%) received transfusions; none received blood exchange. Transfused patients had more frequent upper lobe radiologic involvement, more severe anemia, higher reticulocyte counts, and higher C-reactive protein than nontransfused patients. Their evolution was more severe in terms of length of opioid requirement, length of noninvasive ventilation treatment, overall time on noninvasive ventilation, and length of stay. At 2-year follow-up after the acute chest syndrome episode, no difference was observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early noninvasive ventilation combined with nonroutine transfusion is well tolerated in acute chest syndrome in children and may spare transfusion in some patients. Early recognition of patients still requiring transfusion is essential and warrants further studies.
36053868	Algorithm-based selection of automated red blood cell exchange procedure goals reduces blood utilization in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit. We evaluated how the calculated FCR-using the manufacturer's algorithm-impacted blood utilization and incidence of acute care encounters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted of 15 adults with SCD who underwent chronic RCE from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2019. Blood utilization and acute care encounters were compared across three time periods: (a) when a fixed FCR of 30% was used (12 months); (b) transition period during which physicians made ad hoc changes to the FCR (25 months); (c) algorithm phase when a procedural FCR between 30% and 50% was selected using an algorithm generated by the manufacturer's built-in software to target a HbS fraction of 8% post-procedure (12 months). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Median blood utilization per procedure decreased from 2398 mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 2271-2759 mL) during the fixed FCR phase to 1887 mL (IQR: 1495-2241 mL) during the algorithm phase (P < 0.001). Similarly, median number of units transfused decreased from 10 (9-11) to 7 (5-9) during the respective phases (P < 0.001). Visits to the emergency department were 1 (0-4) in the fixed FCR phase and 0 (0-3) in the algorithm phase. CONCLUSION: Algorithm-based selection of a procedural FCR significantly reduced blood utilization (~21%) without appearing to increase acute care encounters.
33514354	Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report.	BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.
32147059	Preliminary evaluation of the clinical implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic pain management in pediatric sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic pain in a clinical setting by comparing youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) who initiated or did not initiate CBT. DESIGN: Youth with SCD (ages 6-18; n = 101) referred for CBT for chronic pain were compared based on therapy attendance: Established Care; Early Termination; or Comparison (i.e., did not initiate CBT). SETTING: Outpatient pediatric psychology and comprehensive SCD clinics in 3 locations at a southeastern children's hospital. INTERVENTIONS: CBT delivery was standardized. Treatment plans were tailored to meet individualized needs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare utilization included pain-related inpatient admissions, total inpatient days, and emergency department reliance (EDR) at 12-months pre-post CBT. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included typical pain intensity, functional disability, and coping efficacy pre-post treatment. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, genotype, and hydroxyurea, early terminators of CBT had increased rates of admissions and hospital days over time relative to comparisons; those who established care had faster reduction in admissions and hospital days over time relative to comparisons. EDR decreased by 0.08 over time for Established Care and reduced by 0.01 for every 1 completed session. Patients who completed pre- and post-treatment PROs reported decreases in typical pain intensity, functional disability, and improved coping efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing CBT care may support reductions in admissions for pain, length of stay, and EDR for youth with chronic SCD pain, which may be partially supported by patient-reported improvements in functioning, coping, and lower pain intensity following CBT. Enhancing clinical implementation of multidisciplinary treatments may optimize the health of these youth.
35584830	How to approach haemolysis: Haemolytic anaemia for the general physician.	Haemolytic anaemia can seem like a complicated topic. The constellation of reticulocytosis, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased unconjugated bilirubin levels and decreased haptoglobin levels should prompt general physicians to consider haemolysis as a differential diagnosis. When further approaching haemolytic anaemia, subdividing patients into those who are 'direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive' (immune) or 'DAT negative' (non-immune) is a simple and clinically relevant way to start to formulate a cause for the haemolytic anaemia. Immune causes of haemolytic anaemia include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, drugs and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions. Non-immune causes include the haemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease) and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation). Early supportive care in haemolytic anaemia is important and may involve blood transfusions as well as interventions to slow the rate of haemolysis, such as steroids in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications of haemolysis include pigment gallstones, high-output cardiac failure and thromboembolism. Haemolytic anaemia should be referred to the haematologist for further investigation, however, the recognition and early management by the general physician is imperative in improving the patient's outcome.
30882896	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) promotes the production of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) by reactivating gamma-genes. Evidence has shown clinical benefits of hydroxyurea in people with sickle cell anemia; however, only a few studies have assessed this treatment in people with beta (beta)-thalassaemia. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to review the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing or ameliorating the requirement of blood transfusions in people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. The second objective is to review the safety of hydroxyurea with regards to severe adverse effects in this population. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched electronic databases and trial registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP and PubMed (09 October 2018).Date of last search of the Group's haemoglobinopathies trials register: 04 March 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of hydroxyurea in people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia, compared with placebo or standard treatment or comparing different doses of hydroxyurea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review, which was verified by a third author. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no high-quality evidence to support or challenge the continued use of hydroxyurea for managing people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Multicentre, randomised controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood transfusion and iron chelation) are needed in order to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving mean haemoglobin levels, as well as for determining its cost-effectiveness.
29729787	Key Components of Pain Management for Children and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease pain manifests as severe acute pain episodes and a debilitating chronic pain syndrome. Acute pain episodes are the most common reason for health care use; however, acute pain episodes are also frequently managed at home. Chronic pain syndrome develops in 30% to 40% of individuals with sickle cell disease, with an increasing incidence and severity with age. We review the critical aspects of pain management that are integral to the comprehensive approach to sickle cell disease pain and are rooted in the biopsychosocial model. The review focuses on opioid pharmacology and psychosocial comorbidities.
37777924	Erythrocytapheresis in a Patient of Sickle Cell Disease Presenting in Crisis.	As per American Society of Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines, the indication for Erythrocytapheresis for sickle cell patients is category III for preoperative management and vaso-occlusive crisis. Erythrocytapheresis, with the help of automated cell separators, has the benefit of reducing the Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) levels to <30.0% with a reduced risk of increasing blood viscosity and single procedure achieving target hemoglobin levels. A 17-year-oldfemale patient who was a known case of sickle cell disease presented to our institution with a vascular necrosis of the right femoral head. Due to the pain and limitations of her day-to-day activities, she was advised for total hip arthroplasty. This patient underwent a successful Erythrocytapheresis using an automated cell separator and was operated on. In a sickle cell patient planned for surgical intervention, the procedure of Erythrocytapheresis can help in decreasing the chances of the patient developing any vaso-occlusive crisis during surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. This technique can help in improving the chances of a successful surgical procedure for such patients.
30637784	Bone marrow transplantation for adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease: Results of a prospective multicenter pilot study.	We conducted a multicenter pilot investigation of the safety and feasibility of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) (NCT 01565616) using a reduced toxicity preparative regimen of busulfan (13.2 mg/kg), fludarabine (175 mg/m2 ) and thymoglobulin (6 mg/kg) and cyclosporine or tacrolimus and methotrexate for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Twenty-two patients (median age 22 years; range 17-36) were enrolled at eight centers. Seventeen patients received marrow from an HLA-identical sibling donor and five patients received marrow from an 8/8 HLA-allele matched unrelated donor. Before BMT, patients had stroke, acute chest syndrome, recurrent pain events, were receiving regular red blood cell transfusions, or had an elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet (TRJ) velocity, which fulfilled eligibility criteria. Four patients developed grades II-III acute GVHD (18%) and six developed chronic GVHD (27%) that was moderate in two and severe in one patient. One patient died of intracranial hemorrhage and one of GVHD. Nineteen patients had stable donor chimerism, 1-year post-transplant. One patient who developed secondary graft failure survives disease-free after a second BMT. The one-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) are 91% (95% CI 68%-98%) and 86% (95% CI, 63%-95%), respectively, and 3-year EFS is 82%. Statistically significant improvements in the pain interference and physical function domains of health-related quality of life were observed. The study satisfied the primary endpoint of 1-year EFS >=70%. This regimen is being studied in a prospective clinical trial comparing HLA-matched donor BMT with standard of care in adults with severe SCD (NCT02766465).

30616807	Targeting HbS Polymerization.	The mutation of beta6 from glu to val in hemoglobin is responsible for the polymer formation that leads to vaso-occlusion, and a range of severe consequences in sickle cell disease. The treatment of the disease can be addressed in many ways, but the prevention of polymer formation is one of the most fundamental approaches one can take. Such prevention includes affecting the polymer structure, or dilution of the fraction of polymerizable hemoglobin. The latter approach includes (1) induction of HbF, which does not itself, nor in hybrid form, join sickle polymers, or (2) restricting the allosteric change in hemoglobin that occurs in oxygen delivery, and which is required for polymer formation. These approaches will be critically reviewed, as well as the most recent developments that show the benefits of simply swelling the volume of the red cell.
30412270	Multiple hemolytic transfusion reactions misinterpreted as severe vaso-occlusive crisis in a patient with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Hemolytic transfusion reactions are a rare, yet serious complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk for such reactions, because they are prone to make alloantibodies against transfused RBCs, complicating this integral part of their disease management. These reactions may be missed, and the patient's state may be attributed to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), with misguided therapy ensuing. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report the clinical course of a patient with complex SCD with a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, followed by multiple acute hemolytic transfusion reactions mistaken for severe VOC. These reactions were diagnosed on retrospective review of the patient's clinical course in consult with the transfusion medicine service. Optimal immunosuppressive therapy ensued and resulted in the stabilization of the anemia and hemolysis laboratory values. Despite these efforts, the patient died 2 months after admission. CONCLUSION: This case provides insight into some of the challenges of managing patients with SCD with multiple comorbidities. Hemolytic transfusion reactions can be difficult to diagnose and may be overlooked in patients with SCD with severe VOC.
30701409	Gene Therapy for Beta-Hemoglobinopathies: Milestones, New Therapies and Challenges.	Inherited monogenic disorders such as beta-hemoglobinopathies (BH) are fitting candidates for treatment via gene therapy by gene transfer or gene editing. The reported safety and efficacy of lentiviral vectors in preclinical studies have led to the development of several clinical trials for the addition of a functional beta-globin gene. Across trials, dozens of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) have been treated via gene therapy and have achieved reduced transfusion requirements. While overall results are encouraging, the outcomes appear to be strongly influenced by the level of lentiviral integration in transduced cells after engraftment, as well as the underlying genotype resulting in thalassemia. In addition, the method of procurement of hematopoietic stem cells can affect their quality and thus the outcome of gene therapy both in SCD and TDT. This suggests that new studies aimed at maximizing the number of corrected cells with long-term self-renewal potential are crucial to ensure successful treatment for every patient. Recent advancements in gene transfer and bone marrow transplantation have improved the success of this approach, and the results obtained by using these strategies demonstrated significant improvement of gene transfer outcome in patients. The advent of new gene-editing technologies has suggested additional therapeutic options. These are primarily focused on correcting the defective beta-globin gene or editing the expression of genes or genomic segments that regulate fetal hemoglobin synthesis. In this review, we aim to establish the potential benefits of gene therapy for BH, to summarize the status of the ongoing trials, and to discuss the possible improvement or direction for future treatments.

35313324	Movement Is Life-Optimizing Patient Access to Total Joint Arthroplasty: Anemia and Sickle Cell Disease Disparities.	Anemia and sickle cell anemia before surgery are often unrecognized medical comorbidities that can and should be addressed. Nearly 6% of the American population meets the criteria for anemia. The elderly, along with patients with renal disease, cancer, heart failure, or diabetes mellitus are more likely to be anemic. The most common form of anemia is due to iron deficiency, which can be easily treated before surgery. Sickle cell anemia occurs in 1 in 365 Black births and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic births, with 100,000 Americans currently living with sickle cell anemia. Patients who have anemia or sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for postoperative complications, including the need for blood transfusions and delayed healing. For those with sickle cell disease, surgeries can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. Patients with sickle cell anemia face barriers in accessing appropriate care; however, these patients can be optimized using preoperative red blood cell transfusions to dilute sickle cells and elevate the hemoglobin level. There should also be careful consideration and monitoring of the pain level of patients with sickle cell anemia in the perioperative period.

32516073	Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Surgical Shunts in Men with Ischemic Priapism.	PURPOSE: Ischemic priapism is a urological emergency that requires prompt intervention to preserve erectile function. Characteristics that influence escalation to surgical intervention remain unclear. We identified factors and developed machine learning models to predict which men presenting with ischemic priapism will require shunting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified men with ischemic priapism admitted to the emergency department of our large county hospital between January 2010 and June 2019. We collected patient demographics, etiology, duration of priapism prior to intervention, interventions attempted and escalation to shunting. Machine learning models were trained and tested using R to predict which patients require surgical shunting. RESULTS: A total of 334 encounters of ischemic priapism were identified. The majority resolved with intracavernosal phenylephrine injection and/or cavernous aspiration (78%). Shunting was required in 10% of men. Median duration of priapism before intervention was longer for men requiring shunting than for men who did not (48 vs 7 hours, p=0.030). Patients with sickle cell disease as the etiology were less likely to require shunting compared to all other etiologies (2.2% vs 15.2%, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Men with longer duration of priapism before treatment more often underwent shunting. However, phenylephrine injection and aspiration remained effective for priapism lasting more than 36 hours. Having sickle cell disease as the etiology of priapism was protective against requiring shunting. We developed artificial intelligence models that performed with 87.2% accuracy and created an online probability calculator to determine which patients with ischemic priapism may require shunting.
36728286	A systematic review comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant to gene therapy in sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT) are two potentially curative approaches for sickle cell disease (SCD), but they have never been compared in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of HSCT and GT to assist clinicians and patients in making informed treatment decisions. METHODS: Phase I-III clinical trials and case reports/series were included. Regimens included HSCT from all stem cell sources, lentiviral gene therapy, and gene editing, with any conditioning regimen. We searched Medline and EMBASE databases as of 1st June 2020 for studies reporting HSCT and GT outcomes in SCD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Descriptive statistics and post-hoc imputation for standard deviations of mean change in FEV1 and FVC were performed. RESULTS: In total, 56 studies (HSCT, n = 53; GT, n = 3) representing 1,198 patients met inclusion criteria (HSCT, n = 1,158; GT, n = 40). Length of follow-up was 3,881.5 and 58.7 patient-years for HSCT and GT, respectively. Overall quality of evidence was low, with no randomized controlled trials identified. Two-year overall survival for HSCT was 91%; mortality was 2.5% for GT. Acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive episodes were reduced post-HSCT and GT. Meta-analysis was not possible due to lack of comparator and heterogeneity in outcome measures reporting. Very few studies reported post-transplant end-organ function. Six secondary malignancies (5 post-HSCT, 1 post-GT) were reported. DISCUSSION: Reporting of SCD-related complications and patient-important outcomes is lacking for both strategies. We advocate for standardized reporting to better compare outcomes within and between treatment groups.
35021607	Effects of corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease and acute complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Whether corticosteroids improve outcome in patients with acute complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) is still debated. We performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim of estimating effects of corticosteroids on the clinical course of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with SCD. The primary outcome was transfusion requirement during hospitalization. Studies were identified by search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL database. Three randomized clinical trials (RCT) and three retrospective cohort studies (RCS) were included, involving 3,304 participants and 5,562 VOC or ACS episodes. There was no difference between corticosteroids and standard treatment regarding transfusion requirement overall (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-2.53) but there was a significant interaction of the study type (P<0.0001): corticosteroid therapy was associated with a lower risk of transfusion in RCT (OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.45) and a higher risk of transfusion in RCS (OR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.33-3.40. In RCT, the length of hospital stay was lower with corticosteroids as compared with standard treatment: mean difference - 24 hours (95% CI: -35 to -14). Corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission as compared with standard treatment, in RCT, RCS, and the entire cohort: OR=5.91, 95% CI: 1.40-24.83; OR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.46-7.36 and OR=3.21, 95% CI: 1.97-5.24, respectively. Corticosteroids were associated with reduced number of transfusions and length of stay in RCT but not in RCS, with more rehospitalizations overall. Additional RCT should be conducted while minimizing the risk of rehospitalizations.
31617585	Innovations in Targeted Anti-Adhesion Treatment for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that leads to significant lifetime morbidity and early mortality. An enhanced understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease has elucidated novel therapeutic targets for which new therapies are in development. In order to increase the therapeutic landscape, it has been important to identify the blood vessel and more specifically the endothelium as the target organ in this complex disease. Through this lens, we present a review of new anti-adhesion therapies for SCD in development. The long-term promise of multimodal therapies for SCD is finally on the horizon.
32199810	Prognostic Value of Hyponatremia During Acute Painful Episodes in Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Low plasma sodium concentration has been recognized as a prognostic factor in several disorders but never evaluated in sickle cell disease. The present study evaluates its value at admission to predict a complication in adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized for an initially uncomplicated acute painful episode. METHODS: The primary outcome of this retrospective study, performed between 2010 and 2015 in a French referral center for sickle cell disease, was a composite criterion including acute chest syndrome, intensive care unit transfer, red blood cell transfusion or inpatient death. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin genotype and concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, and white blood cell count. RESULTS: We included 1218 stays (406 patients). No inpatient death occurred during the study period. Hyponatremia (plasma sodium <=135 mmol/L) at admission in the center was associated with the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.91, P = 0.001), with acute chest syndrome (OR 1.95 [95% CI 1.2-3.17, P = 0.008]), and red blood cell transfusion (OR 2.71 [95% CI 1.58-4.65, P <0.001]) but not significantly with intensive care unit transfer (OR 1.83 [95% CI 0.94-3.79, P = 0.074]). Adjusted mean length of stay was longer by 1.1 days (95% CI 0.5-1.6, P <0.001) in patients with hyponatremia at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia at admission in the medical department for an acute painful episode is a strong and independent prognostic factor of unfavorable outcome and, notably, acute chest syndrome. It could help targeting patients who may benefit from closer monitoring.

31808845	Management of liver complications in sickle cell disease.	Liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite this, the natural history of liver disease is not well characterized and the evidence basis for specific therapeutic intervention is not robust. The spectrum of clinical liver disease encountered includes asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function; acute deteriorations in liver function, sometimes with a dramatic clinical phenotype; and decompensated chronic liver disease. In this paper, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of patients with acute and chronic liver disease will be outlined. Advice will be given regarding initial assessment and investigation. The evidence for specific medical and surgical interventions will be reviewed, and management recommendations made for each specific clinical presentation. The potential role for liver transplantation will be considered in detail.
32628359	Four phase 1 trials to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of single and repeated dosing of SCO-101 in adult male and female volunteers.	SCO-101 (Endovion) was discontinued 20 years ago as a new drug under development against sickle cell anaemia. Data from the phase 1 studies remained unpublished. New data indicate that SCO-101 might be efficacious as add-on therapy in cancer. Thus, we report the results from the four phase 1 trials performed between 2001 and 2002. Adult volunteers received SCO-101 or placebo in four independent trials. Adverse events were recorded, and SCO-101 was determined for pharmacokinetic analysis. Ninety-two volunteers completed the trials. The most remarkable adverse effect was a transient and dose-dependent increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Plasma SCO-101 elimination was approximately log linear, with apparent oral clearances of between 315 and 2103 mL/h for single doses, and between 121 and 2433 mL/h at steady state following oral administration. There was a marked decrease in clearance with increasing dose, and for repeated dose versus single dose. Tmax was greater, and Cmax and AUC  were lower in the fed state compared to the fasted state. Exposure was equivalent in males and females and for African Americans and Caucasians. In conclusion, SCO-101 appears to be a safe drug with a predictable PK profile. Its efficacy as add-on to standard anticancer drugs has yet to be defined.

38324722	Incidence and Risk Factors of Pain Crisis After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) or pain crises are the commonest indications for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Elimination of pain crisis post-HCT is an important patient-centered outcome and may improve understanding of the natural history of pain syndromes in SCD. We examined de-identified records of 763 patients followed for a median of 36.7 months (0.3-168.6) with 69.6% patient's age at HCT <18 years, 83.3% patient's Karnofsky-Lansky Performance (KPS) score >= 90, overall survival 92.9%, event-free survival 72.4%, graft failure (GF) 22.4%, AGVHD 21.4%, CGVHD 27%, and pain crisis 8.65%. On unadjusted logistic regression, increased risk of pain crisis post-HCT was observed in patients with age at HCT >10 years (11-17 years [OR=9.43; 95% CI: 3.20, 27.79, p<0.0001], age >= 18 years [ OR=16.62; 95% CI: 5.85, 47.16, p<0.0001]), history of pain crisis 2 years before HCT [OR= 13.16, 95% CI: 4.08, 42.42, p<0.0001], alternate donors (haploidentical [OR= 4.80; 95% CI: 2.48, 9.31, p<0.0001], unrelated matched [OR= 2.71; 95% CI: 1.23, 5.97, p=0.0132], and mismatched unrelated [OR= 3.19; 95% CI: 1.44, 7.05, p=0.0041], and with GF [n= 41(5.37%), OR = 7.15; 95% CI: 4.20, 12.18., p<0.0001]. Pain crisis was less frequent with KPS >=90 [OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.55, p<0.0001]. Multivariable logistic regression models confirmed age at HCT, KPS, graft type, donor type, history of VOC 2 yearspre-HCT, and GF as independent predictors of pain crisis post-HCT and generated predictive models and nomograms for pain crisis post-HCT for SCD which can support shared decision-making.
34898139	Biologic and Clinical Efficacy of LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by the painful recurrence of vaso-occlusive events. Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene, which produces an antisickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 1-2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial 7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease, and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: As of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbAT87Q contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (+-SD) of 85+-8% of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment. Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed during up to 37.6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-time treatment with LentiGlobin resulted in sustained production of HbAT87Q in most red cells, leading to reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events.

34544432	Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: a vicious cycle of secondary events.	Painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) remains the most common reason for presenting to the Emergency Department and hospitalization in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although two new agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating SCD, they both target to reduce the frequency of VOC. Results from studies investigating various approaches to treat and shorten VOC have so far been generally disappointing. In this paper, we will summarize the complex pathophysiology and downstream events of VOC and discuss the likely reasons for the disappointing results using monotherapy. We will put forward the rationale for exploring some of the currently available agents to either protect erythrocytes un-involved in the hemoglobin polymerization process from sickling induced by the secondary events, or a multipronged combination approach that targets the complex downstream pathways of VOC.
36996737	Non-pharmacological pain interventions for sickle cell crisis in pediatrics: A scoping review.	PROBLEM: Sickle cell crises (SCC) are recurrent, severe pain episodes experienced by people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Non-pharmacological interventions have been recommended for SCC pain management however, little is known about the impact of these interventions on SCC pain. This scoping review aims to systematically identify evidence on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for pain management during SCC in the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they are published in English and focusing on the use of any non-pharmacological interventions on pain during SCC in pediatric patients. Nine databases were searched including Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. Also, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched. SAMPLE: The database searching yielded 1517 studies. After the title and abstract screening, 1348 studies were excluded, and 169 full texts were retrieved and screened. One study was identified through handsearching. Finally, 27 articles were included in this scoping review. RESULTS: Across all studies, 27 different non-pharmacological interventions were identified. There were inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of virtual reality, guided imagery, and cognitive-behavioral interventions in experimental studies. The most common interventions used at home were prayer, massage, and distraction. The main interventions used in hospitals were prayer and fluid intake, but this was explored by a few studies. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients use numerous non-pharmacological interventions to manage pain during SCC. However, the impact of many interventions on SCC pain has not been empirically investigated. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on SCC pain.
30171881	Does sickle cell disease have a psychosomatic component? A particular focus on anxiety and depression.	Sickle cell disease, an early-age genetic condition, encompasses a range of blood disorders with severe complications. This disease is characterized by the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin molecules, which tend to polymerize due to their low solubility upon deoxygenation in the peripheral capillary beds, resulting in sickle-like red blood cells. Sickled cells lose their normal functioning and hemodynamic properties, leading to chronic fatigue as well as to episodes of painful crises. Over the last two decades, a growing body of clinical evidence has pointed out that these somatic complaints can give rise to neuropsychiatric disorders, among which anxiety and depression are the most common, that worsen the health-related quality of life in patients. At first glance, this somatic influence may be unsurprising, as both anxiety and depressive signs are prevalent in almost all chronic diseases. However, in the case of a genetic condition such as sickle cell disease whose somatic disturbances are predetermined, the fact that mood disorders can increase fatigue and pain through a psychosomatic component has attracted increasing attention. In this review, we address the hypothesis of a psychosomatic component in patients with sickle cell disease by underlining the most relevant clinical studies that have highlighted the existence of a bidirectional link between physical and psychological sequelae, which are reported to be relieved not only by pharmacological cotreatments but also by the concomitant application of cognitive behavioral therapy.
37675899	Gene therapy for Hemoglobinopathies.	Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are autosomal recessive disorders of red blood cells due to mutations in the adult ss-globin gene, with a worldwide diffusion. The severe forms of hemoglobinopathies are fatal if untreated, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be offered to a limited proportion of patients. The unmet clinical need and the disease incidence have promoted the development of new genetic therapies based on the engineering of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Here, the steps of ex vivo gene therapy development are reviewed along with results from clinical trials and recent new approaches employing cutting edge gene editing tools.
30805858	Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Outcomes of Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: a Nationwide Inpatient Sample Analysis, 2004-2014.	BACKGROUND: With advances in disease-specific treatments and improved overall survival, obesity rates are rising among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the role of bariatric surgery on clinical outcomes among hospitalized obese patients with SCD. METHODS: The United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried between 2004 and 2014 for discharges with co-diagnoses of morbid obesity and SCD. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, biliary-pancreatic complications, renal failure, urinary tract infection, malnutrition, sepsis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, thromboembolic events, strictures, wound infection, length of stay, and hospitalization costs. Using Poisson regression, adjusted incidence risk ratios (IRR) were derived for clinical outcomes in patients with prior-bariatric surgery compared to those without bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Among 2549 patients with a discharge diagnosis of SCD and morbid obesity, only 42 patients (1.7%) had bariatric surgery. On multivariable analysis, bariatric surgery did not influence mortality (P = 0.98). Bariatric surgery was not associated with increased risk for acute chest syndrome, sepsis, multi-organ failure, biliary-pancreatic, or surgery-related complications (all P > 0.05). Interestingly, bariatric surgery decreased risk of vaso-occlusive crises (IRR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.69; P = 0.01) in these patients and was associated with a shorter length of stay (P < 0.001) but higher hospitalization costs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery may lower rates of vaso-occlusive crises in morbidly obese sickle cell patients without significantly affecting mortality and other adverse outcomes. In spite of this, these weight loss surgeries are underutilized in this select population.
33494879	Transfusion and Cellular Therapy in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Alloimmunization and iron overload remain significant complications of transfusion therapy and are minimized with prophylactic Rh and K antigen RBC matching and iron chelation. Matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a curative therapeutic option. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has recently shown great promise, for which obtaining sufficient HSCs is essential for success. This article discusses RBC transfusion indications and complications, transfusion support during HSCT, and HSC mobilization and collection for autologous HSCT with gene therapy.
35044697	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is more prevalent in Duffy-null red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Resistance to malaria infection may be conferred by erythrocyte genetic variations including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and lack of Duffy antigens. In red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, G6PD deficiency may shorten transfusion survival. Because Duffy-null units are commonly transfused in sickle cell disease (SCD) due to antigen matching protocols, we examined whether Duffy-null donor RBC units have a higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. RBC unit segments were collected to measure G6PD activity and RBC genotyping. The decline in donor hemoglobin (DeltaHbA) following transfusion was assessed from immediate posttransfusion estimates and HbA measurements approximately 1 month later. RESULTS: Of 564 evaluable RBC units, 59 (10.5%) were G6PD deficient (23 severe, 36 moderate deficiency); 202 (37.6%) units were Duffy-null. G6PD deficiency occurred in 40 (19.8%) Duffy-null units versus 15 (4.5%) Duffy-positive units (p < .0001). In univariate analysis, the fraction of Duffy-null RBC units per transfusion was associated with greater decline in HbA (p = .038); however, in multivariate analysis, severe G6PD deficiency (p = .0238) but not Duffy-null RBC (p = .0139) were associated with DeltaHbA. CONCLUSION: Selection of Duffy-null RBC units may result in shorter in vivo survival of transfused RBCs due to a higher likelihood of transfusing units from G6PD deficient donors.
31566780	The sex parameter in estimation of total blood volume for pediatric erythrocytapheresis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Estimation of the total blood volume (TBV) is fundamental to the control of automated red cell exchange (RCE). Error in the TBV estimate can produce outcomes that deviate from the prescribed targets, and may endanger the patient. Both the Spectra Optia and the COBE Spectra use the Nadler formulae to estimate TBV. There is a potential for large overestimates of TBV when the Nadler formula for males is applied to prepubertal boys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study uses our large clinical experience with RCE to examine procedure outcomes when RCE in prepubertal boys is programed with the female parameter instead of male. We determined the differences between programmed and measured values for three outcomes: (a) Programmed End Hematocrit - Post spun HCT by Hemata Stat II, (b) Programmed End Hematocrit - Post CBC HCT, and (c) Predicted Post Hgb S+C - Measured Post Hgb S+C. We defined the experimental group as Male-Female, where the biological sex was male but programmed sex was female, and two control groups where programmed and biological sex were the same. RESULTS: Small but statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the mean programmed-to-observed deviations of these outcome measures in all but two group and subgroup comparisons; however, the absolute magnitudes of the observed differences were not clinically significant. The suggested weight cutoff to begin programming males as male is 35 kg. CONCLUSION: The study provides experiential validation that performing RCE in prepubertal boys using the female parameter is safe.
33895405	Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes among Medicaid and Privately Insured Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Compared with privately insured patients, recipients of Medicaid have been reported to have worse outcomes in several clinical conditions and following various surgical and medical procedures. However, the relationship between health insurance status and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) outcomes among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well described. We sought to compare alloHCT outcomes between patients with SCD who underwent alloHCT while enrolled on Medicaid versus those who underwent alloHCT while covered by private health insurance. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study using data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. US patients enrolled on Medicaid or private insurance who underwent a first alloHCT for SCD between 2008 and 2018 were eligible for this study. The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), defined as time to death or graft failure. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for EFS and OS. The proportion of patients with graft failure, acute GVHD, and/or chronic GVHD was calculated using the cumulative incidence estimator to accommodate competing risks (ie, death). Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with EFS, OS, graft failure, and acute and chronic GVHD. A total of 399 patients (Medicaid, n = 225; private insurance, n = 174) were included in this study. The median duration of follow-up was 34 months (range, 1.0 to 134.7 months) for the Medicaid group and 38.7 months (range, 0.3 to 139.3 months) for the private insurance group. Compared with the patients with private insurance, those on Medicaid had a significantly lower 3-year EFS (75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69.4% to 81%] versus 82.2% [95% CI, 76.9% to 87.8%]; P = .0279) and a significantly higher 3-year cumulative incidence of graft failure (17.2% [95% CI, 12.5% to 22.5%] versus 10.5% [95% CI, 6.4% to 15.4%]; P = .0372). There were no significant between-group differences in 3-year OS (P = .6337) or in the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (P = .4556) or chronic GVHD (P = .6878). Cox regression analysis after adjusting for other significant variables showed that the patients enrolled on Medicaid had a lower EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.85; P = .0006) and a higher cumulative incidence of graft failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.43 to 4.60; P = .0015), with no significant between-group differences in OS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.07; P = .9765), acute GVHD (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.49; P = .7905), or cGVHD (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.48; P = .9331). That EFS is worse in patients on Medicaid compared with privately insured individuals following alloHCT for SCD provides the rationale for research to better understand the mechanisms by which insurance status impacts alloHCT outcomes among patients with SCD.
34724240	Safety of intravenous arginine therapy in children with sickle cell disease hospitalized for vaso-occlusive pain: A randomized placebo-controlled trial in progress.	
34981144	The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of single-dose deferiprone in subjects with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo repeated blood transfusions often develop iron overload. Deferiprone (Ferriprox ) is an oral iron chelator indicated for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes and has been recently approved as a treatment for iron overload in adult and pediatric patients with SCD and other anemias. The present study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of deferiprone (DFP) in adult subjects with SCD. In this phase I, open-label study, subjects with SCD were administered a single 1500 mg dose of DFP. Blood and urine samples were collected for PK assessments of DFP and its main metabolite, deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide (DFP-G). Eight subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Following drug administration, serum levels of DFP and DFP-G rose to maximum concentrations at 1.0 and 2.8 h post-dose, respectively. The half-lives of DFP and DFP-G were 1.5 and 1.6 h, respectively. The majority of administered drug was metabolized and excreted as DFP-G, with less than 4% excreted unchanged in urine up to 10 h post-dose. Subjects received a safety assessment 7 (+- 3) days post-dose. Two subjects reported mild adverse events unrelated to the study drug, and no other safety concerns were reported. The PK profile of DFP in SCD subjects is consistent with previous reports in healthy adult volunteers, suggesting no special dosing adjustments are indicated for this population. These findings provide valuable insight for treating iron overload in patients with SCD, who have limited chelation therapy treatment options (trial registration number: NCT01835496, date of registration: April 19, 2013).
33638018	Stroke and presence of patent foramen ovale in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited monogenic hemoglobinopathy characterized by formation of sickle erythrocytes under conditions of deoxygenation. Sickle erythrocytes can lead to thrombus formation and vaso-occlusive episodes that may result in hemolytic anemia, pain crisis and multiple organ damage. Moreover, SCD is characterized by endothelial damage, increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and aggravation, and activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways. Cerebrovascular events constitute an important clinical complication of SCD. Children with SCD have a 300-fold higher risk of acute stroke and by the age of 45 about 25% of patients have suffered an overt stoke. Management and prevention of stroke in patients with SCD is not well defined. Moreover, the presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of the occurrence of an embolic cerebrovascular event. The role of PFO closure and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy has not been well investigated. Moreover, during COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account the increased rates of thrombotic events and the difficulties in blood transfusion, management of SCD patients is even more challenging and difficult, since data are scarce regarding stroke occurrence and management in this specific population in the COVID-19 era. This review focuses on pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCD and possible treatment strategies in the presence of PFO.
38066894	The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in sickle cell disease: all haplos are not created equally.	The ideal curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with strokes and preexisting heart, lung, and kidney disease. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with SCD has shown excellent outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability of a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related death in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant barriers to curative therapy in SCD, related haploidentical HCT has become an active area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the life span. Importantly, most adults, even with strokes or significant comorbidities, can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related death. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged as potential curative therapies for SCD: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete, bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities, differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches for SCD.

30324810	Promise of gene therapy to treat sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disease caused by a single-gene mutation that affects millions of individuals world-wide. In this review, we focus on techniques to treat SCA by ex vivo genetic manipulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC), emphasizing replacement gene therapy and gene editing. AREAS COVERED: Viral transduction of an anti-sickling beta-like globin gene has been tested in pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies, and shows promising preliminary results. Targeted editing of endogenous genes by site-directed nucleases has been developed more recently, and several approaches also are nearing clinical translation. EXPERT OPINION: The indications and timing of gene therapy for SCA in lieu of supportive care treatment and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are still undefined. In addition, ensuring access to the treatment where the disease is endemic will present important challenges that must be addressed. Nonetheless, gene therapy and gene editing techniques have transformative potential as a universal curative option in SCA.
37581462	Improved Quality of Life of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant: Another Indication for Transplant.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is frequently inherited worldwide. The severity of SCD ranges from mild to severe, and the disease involves multiple complications, including pulmonary hypertension, stroke, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, end-organ damage, and an increased mortality risk. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for patients with SCD. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The objective was to assess the quality of life of adolescent and adult patients with SCD receiving HCT pre-and post-transplant. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with SCD with at least one year of follow-up after HCT were interviewed to assess their quality of life pre-and post-transplant. This study was conducted at the Transplant Center of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The participants were identified through non-probability consecutive sampling. The FACT-G questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life domains. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. The median age of the respondents was 32 +- 6.3 years, and 16 were male (51.6%). The most frequent indication for stem cell transplantation (58%) was a vaso-occlusive crisis. The mean FACT-G scores pre- and post-transplantation were 55.2 +- 18.17 and 91 +- 14.58, respectively. The mean number of annual ER visits was significantly reduced from 27.3 pre-transplant to 6.6 post-transplant (P-value = 0.006). Of the respondents, 51.6% experienced no severe complications post-transplantation, and most (93.5%) reported improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: HCT significantly improved the quality of life of adult patients with SCD, with improvements in most FACT-G score domains. Although it was not measured by the FACT-G, the frequency of ER visits and hospital admissions were reduced significantly post-transplant, reflecting an improvement in the quality of life and a reduction in the cost of therapy for patients with SCD.
30037443	Rapid Fire: Sickle Cell Disease.	Emergency providers are likely to encounter sickle cell disease-related emergencies. The pathophysiology of emergent complaints are usually related to either an acute anemia or a vasoocclusive crisis. Differentiating between the two is the first step in the workup. Anemic crises must then be differentiated by the source. Vasoocclusive crises must be appropriately treated with aggressive pain management, gentle hydration, and other appropriate adjuncts. Early recognition and treatment are key in providing excellent emergency care to those with sickle cell disease.
36053825	Converting adults with sickle cell disease from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine: A reliable method with safety and early evidence of reduced acute care utilization.	Buprenorphine, a novel opioid with complex pharmacology, is effective for treating pain and is qualitatively safer than high-dose full agonist opioid therapy; but transitioning to buprenorphine can be technically complex and carries some risk of precipitated withdrawal. We report our clinic's experience converting 36 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine using a method developed in the past 10 years. Thirty of these patients were induced using a standard outpatient protocol and six were induced during medical admissions. Typically, patients were on high-dose chronic opioid therapy (COT) with inadequate response, and often with very high acute care utilization. Unlike prior case series, the method of induction, dosing, and management of withdrawal are detailed, as are post-induction adverse events. There were seven adverse events in the first 3 days following standard induction, and two of which were judged to be definitely related to the induction but none with any lasting sequelae. At 6 months follow-up, five participants had discontinued buprenorphine (16.67%), and overall acute care visits dropped from a mean of 10.50 (SD 11.35) in the 6 months pre-induction to 2.89 (SD 3.40) in the 6 months post-induction. In an appropriately interdisciplinary care setting, buprenorphine shows promise as a safe alternative to COT with early evidence of benefit for high-utilizing patients with SCD.
28771666	How I manage sickle cell patients with high transcranial doppler results.	Stroke is one of the most severe complications to affect children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Transcranial doppler (TCD) is an accurate and non-invasive method to determine stroke risk. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of chronic transfusion therapy in stroke prevention based on risk stratification determined by TCD velocities. This has led to the regular use of TCD monitoring for children with SCA in order to determine stroke risk. Significant resource allocation is necessary to facilitate training, quality assurance and failsafe arrangements for non-attenders. In a subgroup of patients, chronic transfusions for primary stroke prevention can be replaced by hydroxycarbamide therapy, provided careful monitoring is undertaken; including repeat TCD studies at frequent intervals. The authors propose an evidence-based algorithm for the management of abnormal TCD velocities and discuss the role of this test in other clinical contexts, such as in Haemoglobin SC disease.
32629525	Use of dual lumen ports for red blood cell exchange: A comparison of adults and children with sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE: Sickle cell patients receiving chronic RBC exchange require a form of long-term central venous access if peripheral access is inadequate. In adults, dual lumen (DL) ports have been utilized but associated with greater procedure complications and duration when compared to other forms of access. In the pediatric sickle cell population, the use of DL ports for RBC exchange has not been well described. In this retrospective cohort study, RBC exchange procedures utilizing DL ports in the pediatric vs adult sickle cell population were compared. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 685 RBC exchange procedures performed on 25 patients (11 pediatric and 14 adult) between November 2014 to November 2018. Patient-level characteristics and outcomes were compared between pediatric and adult patients using the Fisher-exact and Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Linear/logistic regression models examined procedure-level parameters and port characteristics with adjustment for clustering. RESULTS: Compared to adults, pediatric patients had slower average maximum inlet speed (42 vs 53 mL/min, P < .01), but shorter procedure time (60 vs 75 minutes, P < .01) and lower rate of access alarms (1% vs 11%, P < .01). Overall, 0.29 thrombotic events per 1000 port days and 0.04 infections per 1000 port days were observed. CONCLUSION: For adult and pediatric sickle cell patients, a DL port provides a viable option for RBC exchange. In comparison to adults, pediatric procedures with a DL port will typically be shorter and with less procedural complications due to smaller blood volumes and lower flow requirements.
38635540	Decreased risk of underdosing with continuous infusion versus intermittent administration of cefotaxime in patients with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: Underdosing of antibiotics is common in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that in critically-ill patients with SCD receiving cefotaxime during acute chest syndrome, the continuous infusion may outperform the intermittent administration in achieving pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets. DESIGN: Prospective before-after study. SETTINGS: Intensive-care unit of a French teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral center. PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive episodes of severe acute chest syndrome in 58 adult patients with sickle cell disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with intermittent administration during the first period (April 2016 -April 2018) and with continuous infusion during the second period (May 2018 -August 2019). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 episodes of acute chest syndrome in 58 patients (29 [25-34] years, 37/58 (64%) males). Daily dose of cefotaxime was similar between groups (59 [48-88] vs. 61 [57-64] mg/kg/day, p = 0.84). Most patients (>75%) presented a glomerular hyperfiltration with no difference between groups (p = 0.25). More patients had a cefotaxime trough level >=2 mg/L with continuous infusion than intermittent administration: 28 (93%) vs. 5 (16%), p<0.001. The median residual concentration was higher in the continuous infusion than intermittent administration group: 10.5 [7.4-13.3] vs. 0 [0-0] mg/L, p<0.001. No infection relapse was observed in the entire cohort. Hospital length of stay was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: As compared to intermittent administration, continuous infusion of cefotaxime maximizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in patients with SCD. The clinical outcome did not differ between the two administration methods; however, the study was underpowered to detect such a difference.
31161685	Interval decline in hemoglobin A is associated with annual clinical event rate in sickle cell anemia patients receiving maintenance apheresis RBC exchange.	BACKGROUND: Apheresis red blood cell (RBC) exchange (RCE) is a standard intervention for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) who have had previous thromboembolic stroke or intractable chronic pain. Replacing sickling cells with those containing hemoglobin A (HbA) minimizes microvascular pathophysiology that produces clinical crises. Limited data exist regarding the interval changes in HbA between transfusions. We sought to describe the HbA decrement between RCE procedures and its relationship to clinical status. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SCA patients (all hemoglobin SS disease) treated with maintenance RCE (n = 21) over a 15-month period at two neighboring institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Time-normalized daily HbA decrement was calculated to reflect loss of transfused RBCs, and annual events of either emergency department or hospital admissions for SCA complications were noted. Associations between HbA decrement and laboratory measures were calculated using mixed linear regression models and unpaired t test was used to compare HbA decrement between high and low event rate groups. RESULTS: A total of 31 events were recorded, and mean HbA decrement per day was 0.77 +- 0.16%. The mean interval between RCEs was 36 +- 12 days. Patients with more annual events exhibited a significantly greater daily HbA decrement (p = 0.007). No significant association between RBC unit age and HbA decrement or annual event rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients exhibiting greater daily HbA decrement were more likely to have multiple emergency department visits or admissions for sickling crises. Modulating HbA decrement may merit study as an intermediate metric for interventions to improve outcomes in hemoglobin SS disease.
28477437	National epidemiological study reveals longer paediatric bone and joint infection stays for infants and in general hospitals.	AIM: Published studies have suggested that two to five days of intravenous treatment could effectively treat paediatric bone and joint infections (PBJI), allowing a faster discharge. This study analysed the factors associated with PBJI hospital stays lasting longer than five days using the French National Hospital Discharge Database. METHODS: We selected children under 15 years hospitalised in 2013 with haematogenous PBJIs using a validated French algorithm based on specific diagnosis and surgical procedure codes. Risk factors for stays of more than five days were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: In 2013, 2717 children were hospitalised for PBJI, with 49% staying more than five days. The overall incidence of 22 per 100 000, was highest in males and toddlers. The main causes were septic arthritis (50%) and osteomyelitis (46%) and 50% of the pathogens were Staphylococci. The odd ratios for stays of five days or more were infancy, coded bacteria and sickle cell disease (7.0), having spondylodiscitis rather than septic arthritis (2.2) and being hospitalised in a general hospital rather than a teaching hospital (1.6). CONCLUSION: Half of the hospital stays exceeded five days, despite scientific evidence supporting a shorter intravenous antibiotherapy regimen. Greater knowledge and widespread use of short treatment regimens are needed.
33243953	Treatment of recalcitrant chronic leg ulcer in a known sickle cell anaemia patient using honey and fresh hbaa red cell concentrate in a Nigerian secondary healthcare facility.	Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) formed by the point mutation in the genetic code of beta-globin chain leading to valine substituting glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-chain. The resultant sickle cell disease (SCD) characterized by occlusion of microvasculature by red blood cells is associated with multiple organ pathologies. One of such complications is chronic leg ulcers. We report a case of chronic leg ulcer, in a known sickle cell anemia patient, which did not respond to the wound dressing methods at the hospital's disposal. The ulcer was successfully treated using standard operative procedure (S.O.P) in wound care, applying local honey, and use of blood transfusion. EA was a 20-year-old university undergraduate who was admitted to April 2019 in Central Hospital Benin City with chronic leg ulcer of 1 year duration. She was also anemic with hemoglobin concentration of 3.0 g/dl (packed cell volume 15%). The wound was dressed with local honey, and anemia corrected with blood transfusion using concentrated red cells lacking the HbS trait. There was a progressive improvement in the healing of the ulcer with total closure after 4 months of treatment. Maintenance and follow-up measures were instituted to prevent reoccurrence. This report showed that honey has remarkable properties in promoting wound healing. Its usage in combination with transfusion of HbA red blood cells to manage chronic leg ulcers in SCD patients is advocated. However, this calls for further studies and research.
30480767	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerisation leading to a symptomatic disorder.Autosomal recessive disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are:- to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease;- to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries,Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
34847228	Deferiprone vs deferoxamine for transfusional iron overload in SCD and other anemias: a randomized, open-label noninferiority study.	Many people with sickle cell disease (SCD) or other anemias require chronic blood transfusions, which often causes iron overload that requires chelation therapy. The iron chelator deferiprone is frequently used in individuals with thalassemia syndromes, but data in patients with SCD are limited. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in patients with SCD or other anemias receiving chronic transfusion therapy. A total of 228 patients (mean age: 16.9 [range, 3-59] years; 46.9% female) were randomized to receive either oral deferiprone (n = 152) or subcutaneous deferoxamine (n = 76). The primary endpoint was change from baseline at 12 months in liver iron concentration (LIC), assessed by R2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The least squares mean (standard error) change in LIC was -4.04 (0.48) mg/g dry weight for deferiprone vs -4.45 (0.57) mg/g dry weight for deferoxamine, with noninferiority of deferiprone to deferoxamine demonstrated by analysis of covariance (least squares mean difference 0.40 [0.56]; 96.01% confidence interval, -0.76 to 1.57). Noninferiority of deferiprone was also shown for both cardiac T2* MRI and serum ferritin. Rates of overall adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal did not differ significantly between the groups. AEs related to deferiprone treatment included abdominal pain (17.1% of patients), vomiting (14.5%), pyrexia (9.2%), increased alanine transferase (9.2%) and aspartate transferase levels (9.2%), neutropenia (2.6%), and agranulocytosis (0.7%). The efficacy and safety profiles of deferiprone were acceptable and consistent with those seen in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This trial study was registered at www://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02041299.

38642304	Expert consensus on the management of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving crizanlizumab: a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel.	Crizanlizumab, a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin, has been shown to reduce vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) compared to placebo in patients >= 16 years with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there have been rare reports of patients experiencing severe pain and subsequent complications within 24 hours of crizanlizumab infusions. These events are defined as infusion-related reactions (IRRs). Informed by current literature and clinical experience, a group of content experts developed clinical guidelines for the management of IRRs in patients with SCD. We used the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) modified Delphi panel method, a valid, reproducible technique for achieving consensus. We present our recommendations for managing IRRs, which depend on patient characteristics including: prior history of IRRs to other monoclonal antibodies or medications, changes to crizanlizumab infusion rate and patient monitoring, pain severity relative to patient's typical SCD crises, and severe allergic symptoms. These recommendations outline how to evaluate and manage IRRs in patients receiving crizanlizumab. Future research should validate this guidance using clinical data and identify patients at risk for these IRRs.
33208686	Real-world efficacy and safety of direct-acting antiviral drugs in patients with chronic hepatitis C and inherited blood disorders.	BACKGROUND: Patients with inherited blood disorders (IBLD) have a high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this work was to assess the efficacy and safety of HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment in patients with IBLD and chronic HCV infection. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (25 with sickle cell disease, 1 with beta-thalassemia and 1 with hemoglobin D-Punjab), including 3 with compensated cirrhosis, were included. They were treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, or velpatasvir or with grazoprevir/elbasvir for 8 or 12 weeks. In the case of treatment failure, in-vitro assessment of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) and full-length genome sequence analysis by means of deep sequencing were performed. RESULTS: Treatment was safe and well-tolerated and there were no drug discontinuations due to DAA-related adverse events. Twenty-five out of the 27 patients (93%) achieved sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment. One patient discontinued after 18 days due to adverse events unrelated to the antiviral treatment. One patient infected with 'unusual' genotype 2 subtype 2m relapsed. Subtype 2m naturally carries the NS5A L31M RAS. In a genotype 2a subgenomic replicon model, L31M increased daclatasvir effective concentration 50% (EC50) by 97-fold, but velpatasvir EC50 by only 3-fold, without altering the replication capacity. This patient was successfully retreated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: DAA-based regimens are well tolerated and highly efficacious in patients with chronic hepatitis C and IBLD in the real-world setting. Thus, DAA-based antiviral treatment should be prioritized in this thus far neglected population of HCV-infected patients.
32618413	Hemoglobin A1c and fructosamine correlate in a patient with sickle cell disease and diabetes on chronic transfusion therapy.	"In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) is unreliable and the American Diabetes Association recommends monitoring long-term glycemia by measuring serum glucose, but use of serum fructosamine (SF), a measurement independent of red cell lifespan, has been reported. SF as a screen for DM in SCD, however, is not standardized and its relationship to serum glucose has not been validated. Further, screening for DM was not adequately addressed in the 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines for SCD management. Blood transfusions, an important treatment for some patients with SCD, can also impact HbA1c . We present a case of a patient with SCD and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes on monthly chronic transfusions therapy (CTT) who had well-correlated ""steady state"" HbA1c and SF levels over time, suggesting for the first time these markers may actually be useful when following long-term glycemic control in patients with SCD on CTT programs."
28919009	Distinct patterns of response to transfusion therapy for different chronic complications of sickle cell disease: A useful insight.	Two main sub-phenotypes have been described in sickle cell disease: one with higher baseline haemoglobin and a higher rate of painful crises and one with lower baseline haemoglobin, increased markers of haemolysis and a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension, priapism and leg ulcers. We compared the patterns of response to regular automated red cell exchange transfusion over a five-year period of 21 patients with recurrent painful crises from the first group and 3 patients with pulmonary hypertension and 5 with recurrent severe stuttering priapism form the second and found them to be distinctly different. Response for pain is slow and increases gradually over years. The most pronounced clinical benefit and the one that appears first is a reduction in the severity rather than the frequency of painful crises. In contrast to the slow and gradual response we see for pain, response of patients with pulmonary hypertension and priapism is immediate with significant clinical improvement even after the first transfusion. The response appears to be directly correlated to the HbS level as the symptoms of both conditions invariably recur rapidly when transfusions are delayed or discontinued but resolve again once they are re-instituted.
36412212	Risk of vaso-occlusive episodes in patients with sickle cell disease exposed to systemic corticosteroids: a comprehensive review.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent inherited disorder in the world. It is caused by a single amino acid mutation on the beta-globin chain, which lead to red blood cell deformation, haemolysis, and chronic inflammation. Clinical consequences are vaso-occlusives crisis, acute chest syndrome, thrombosis, infection, and chronic endothelial injury. AREAS COVERED: Corticosteroids are an old therapeutic class, that are inexpensive and widely available, which can be administered in different forms. Their adverse effects are numerous and well-known. This class could appear to be useful in SCD treatment due to its anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, corticosteroids remain an essential therapeutic class for many indications, besides SCD. Although specific adverse effects of corticosteroids have been suspected in SCD patients for decades, recent papers has reported strong evidence of specific and severe adverse effects in this population. Based on a literature review, we will discuss pathophysiological considerations, consequences, and practical use of corticosteroids in SCD. EXPERT OPINION: High corticosteroid doses, for any indication , induce vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and re-hospitalization in patients with SCD. There is no evidence of any benefits of corticosteroid use in the SCD acute events. Prevention by hydroxyurea and/or red blood cell transfusion or exchange should be discussed when corticosteroid use is indispensable.
28939451	HLA Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant with Pretransplant Immunosuppression for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative in patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD), but a significant number of patients lack an HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor. Mismatched related (haploidentical) HCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) allows expansion of the donor pool but is complicated by high rates of graft failure. In this report we describe a favorable haploidentical HCT approach in a limited cohort of SCD patients with significant comorbidities. To reduce the risk of graft failure we administered the conditioning regimen of rabbit antithymocyte globulin, busulfan, and fludarabine preceded with 2 courses of pretransplant immunosuppressive therapy (PTIS) with fludarabine and dexamethasone. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of PTCY on days +3 and +4 followed by tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day +5. Four patients (ages 13, 19, 19, and 23 years) received T cell-replete haploidentical stem cell infusion. All patients engrafted with 99.9% to 100% donor chimerism, and all patients continued with stable engraftment at the last follow-up (5 to 11 months post-transplant). Time to neutrophil engraftment was 14 to 26 days. Two patients had high levels of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, which required the implementation of an antibody management protocol. This facilitated neutrophil engraftment on day +16 and day +26, respectively. One patient developed grade I acute GVHD, which resolved. Three patients developed mild, limited skin GVHD that responded to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Human herpesvirus-6 viremia was detected in 3 patients but resolved without treatment. One patient developed asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia that responded appropriately to standard therapy with ganciclovir. The prompt, stable engraftment and low toxicity in the post-transplant period makes PTIS with haploidentical transplant a promising option for patients with SCD.
33855970	Genetic therapies for the first molecular disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe bone pain, multi-organ failure, and early mortality. Although medical progress over the past several decades has improved clinical outcomes and offered cures for many affected individuals living in high-income countries, most SCD patients still experience substantial morbidity and premature death. Emerging technologies to manipulate somatic cell genomes and insights into the mechanisms of developmental globin gene regulation are generating potentially transformative approaches to cure SCD by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Key components of current approaches include ethical informed consent, isolation of patient HSCs, in vitro genetic modification of HSCs to correct the SCD mutation or circumvent its damaging effects, and reinfusion of the modified HSCs following myelotoxic bone marrow conditioning. Successful integration of these components into effective therapies requires interdisciplinary collaborations between laboratory researchers, clinical caregivers, and patients. Here we summarize current knowledge and research challenges for each key component, emphasizing that the best approaches have yet to be developed.
31789782	Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), is rare in the pediatric population and is characterized by severe headaches and other neurologic symptoms. We present a case of RCVS occurring concomitantly with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in an 8-year-old African American child with sickle cell disease (HbSS). Imaging studies including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography of the brain showed acute hemorrhagic stroke and a beaded appearance of peripheral cerebral vessels. In this report, we focus on the typical features of RCVS and discuss the underlying risk factors that may increase the risk in patients with HbSS disease.
33527340	Haemoglobin response to senicapoc in patients with sickle cell disease: a re-analysis of the Phase III trial.	
28893518	Curative approaches for sickle cell disease: A review of allogeneic and autologous strategies.	Despite sickle cell disease (SCD) first being reported >100years ago and molecularly characterized >50years ago, patients continue to experience severe morbidity and early mortality. Although there have been substantial clinical advances with immunizations, penicillin prophylaxis, hydroxyurea treatment, and transfusion therapy, the only cure that can be offered is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this work, we summarize the various allogeneic curative approaches reported to date and discuss open and upcoming clinical research protocols. Then we consider gene therapy and gene editing strategies that may enable cure based on autologous HSCs.
30500440	Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplantation with Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide Plus Thiotepa Improves Donor Engraftment in Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia: Results of an International Learning Collaborative.	Curative therapy for individuals with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor has been frustratingly elusive. In with the goal of improving engraftment while minimizing transplantation-related morbidity, a multi-institutional learning collaborative was developed in the context of a Phase II clinical trial of nonmyeloablative, related HLA-haploidentical (haplo) bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. All eligible participants had hemoglobin SS, and 89% (16 of 18) had an identifiable donor. The median patient age was 20.9 years (IQR, 12.1 to 26.0 years), and the most common indication for transplantation was overt stroke (in 69%; 11 of 16). In the first 3 patients, the conditioning regimen consisted of antithymocyte globulin, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low-dose total body irradiation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus. Primary graft rejection occurred in 2 of the 3 patients (67%), which triggered the study-stopping rule. To reduce graft rejection risk, thiotepa was added to the conditioning regimen, and then 15 patients (including 2 with previous graft rejection) underwent haplo-BMT with this thiotepa-augmented conditioning regimen. At a median follow-up of 13.3 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.8 to 23.1 months), 93% (14 of 15) had >95% stable donor engraftment at 6 months, with 100% overall survival. The median time to neutrophil engraftment (>500) was 22 days (IQR, 19 to 27 days), and that for platelet engraftment (>50 x 109/L) was 28 days (IQR, 27 days to not reached). Two patients had grade III-IV acute GVHD, 1 patient had mild chronic GVHD, and 86% of patients (6 of 7) were off immunosuppression therapy by 1-year post-transplantation. Our data suggest that haplo-BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and thiotepa improves donor engraftment without significantly increasing morbidity or mortality and could dramatically expand curative options for individuals with SCD.
36877640	Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia.	"BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron-chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022). SELECTION CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi-component interventions, non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For this update, two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  Adherence was reported as ""good"", ""high"" or ""excellent"" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all-cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all-cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation-related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all-cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was ""excellent"" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all-cause mortality.  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all-cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi-experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow-up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups."
33757549	Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapy for Sickle cell disease in South Asia: inconsistent treatment of a neglected disease.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies remain the main therapeutic strategies for Sickle cell disease. Preliminary data suggest substantial variation and inconsistencies in practice of these two therapeutic modalities in South Asia. In this systematic review we searched Medline, Cochrane library and Scopus for articles on usage of hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies for sickle cell disease in South Asia published in English between October 2005 and October 2020. RESULTS: We selected 41 papers: 33 from India, 3 from Sri Lanka, 2 each from Pakistan and Bangladesh and one from Nepal. Only 14 prospective trials focused on hydroxyurea therapy from which majority (n = 10; 71.4%) adopted fixed low dose (10 mg/kg/day) regimen. With hydroxyurea therapy, 12 and 9 studies reported significant reductions in vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirement respectively. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin level < 6-7 g/dl) was the commonest indicator (n = 8) for transfusion therapy followed by vaso-occlusive crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Published data on the hydroxyurea and transfusion therapies in South Asia are limited and heterogeneous. A clear gap of knowledge exists about the nature of the sickle cell disease in the Indian subcontinent particularly from countries outside India necessitating further evidence-based assessments and interventions.
31782875	Early viral reactivation despite excellent immune reconstitution following haploidentical Bone marrow transplant with post-transplant cytoxan for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haplo-BMT) offers near universal donor availability as a curative modality for individuals with severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the required intense immunodepletion is associated with increased infectious complications. A paucity of data exists on immune reconstitution following haplo-BMT for SCD. METHODS: A multi-institution learning collaborative was developed in the context of a phase II clinical trial of a non-myeloablative, related haplo-BMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for SCD. We report results from a cohort of 23 patients for whom immune reconstitution data up to one year were available. RESULTS: Median age was 14.8 years. Out of 23, 18 participants received pre-conditioning with azathioprine, hydroxyurea, and hypertransfusions. 70% (16/23) of participants had multiple indications for haplo-BMT. We observed excellent immune reconstitution of CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD56 cellular subsets by 6 months post transplant. Engraftment rate and event-free survival in this cohort were 100% and 96%, respectively. 70% (16/23) of patients had at least one viral reactivation or infection, including CMV 35% (8/23), HHV-6 22% (5/23), and polyoma virus 17% (4/23), with no cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. CONCLUSION: Further prospective studies are needed to better characterize immune reconstitution and the immunologic basis for increased viral reactivation following haplo-BMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for SCD.
31681984	Malaria chemoprophylaxis in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Malaria is the most common precipitating cause of crises in sickle cell disease in malaria-endemic countries. Health professionals often recommend life-long malaria chemoprophylaxis for people with sickle cell disease living in these areas. It is therefore important we have good evidence of benefit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of routine malaria chemoprophylaxis in people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (January 2006), Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Specialized Register (July 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1974 to January 2006), LILACS (1982 to January 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted organizations and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing chemoprophylaxis with any antimalarial drug given for a minimum of three months compared with a placebo or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias in the trials, and extracted data. Dichotomous data were analysed using risk ratios (RR) and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Two trials with a total of 223 children with homozygous sickle cell disease met the inclusion criteria. A randomized controlled trial in Nigeria compared two different antimalarial drugs with a placebo, and reported that chemoprophylaxis reduced sickle cell crises (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.83; 97 children), hospital admissions (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63; 97 participants), and blood transfusions (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56; 97 participants). A quasi-randomized controlled trial of 126 children in Uganda compared an antimalarial drug plus antibiotics with no antimalarial plus placebo. Chemoprophylaxis reduced the number of episodes of malaria and dactylitis, and increased mean haemoglobin values in this trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is beneficial to give routine malaria chemoprophylaxis in sickle cell disease in areas where malaria is endemic. 4 November 2019 Update pending New contributors needed The CIDG Editors are looking for contributors to update and maintain this Cochrane Review.

32470105	Use of nonopioid agents for inpatient pain management of sickle cell disease.	
31348518	Survival and specific outcome of sickle cell disease patients after renal transplantation.	The prognosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients who need dialysis is poor, but experience with kidney transplantation is limited. This study assessed the characteristics of 36 SCD patients undergoing renal transplantation. Immediate post-surgical complications occurred in 25% of cases. Cytomegalovirus and bacterial infections were frequently observed. Twelve patients died after a median follow-up period of 17 4 months. Overall patient survival was significantly lower in SCD than in the control group without significant difference for overall death-censored graft survival. Our data suggest that renal transplantation should be systematically considered in SCD patients with end-stage renal disease.
32789826	Patient-controlled analgesia and morphine consumption in sickle cell anemia painful crises: A new protocol.	OBJECTIVES: The sudden and rapidly increasing severity of pain in sickle cell anemia painful crises frequently requires the use of strong opioids. Patients require continuous administrations of various doses (increased/decreased) within the following hours. This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the effects of a structured protocol based on standardized Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) patient demand count on morphine consumption in painful crises. METHODS: A total of 177 painful crises of 93 patients who were administered morphine using the PCA method according to appropriate analgesia protocol between 2004-2018 were evaluated in this study. The demographic data, hemoglobin chromatography and genotypes, painful episode follow-up time, VAS scores before and after treatment, and daily morphine consumption of the patients were recorded. Morphine consumption during the crisis according to age groups and sex were compared. RESULTS: Of the patients, 57% were homozygous hemoglobin type SS (HbSS). Mean morphine consumption with PCA method was 56.9+-35.4 mg (min-max: 10-232 mg) and mean follow-up time was 3.4+-2.1 days (min.-max.: 1-11). VAS scores were significantly lower after treatment (6.8+-2.3 pre-treatment; 0.8+-0.6 post-treatment) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our study is the first structured protocol based on VAS and PCA demand data. We believe lower morphine dosage using PCA protocol according to the rapidly changing pain levels of the patients will provide effective analgesia. Prospective studies with fewer limitations will more effectively demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol.
32716555	Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.

36726036	Massage therapy for children, adolescents, and young adults: Clinical delivery and effectiveness in hematology and oncology.	BACKGROUND: Children, adolescents, and young adults with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions experience multiple, significant symptoms (e.g., pain, stress, and anxiety), which may be addressed by nonpharmacologic approaches such as massage therapy (MT). The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical delivery of MT provided by a certified pediatric massage therapist and assess effectiveness in two patient groups: those with sickle cell disease (SCD) or hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc). METHODS: Investigators conducted a retrospective review of MT sessions provided to patients 0-39 years with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions at a large pediatric academic medical center. RESULTS: Between October 2019 and December 2021, 3015 MT sessions were provided to 243 patients (171 HemOnc; 72 SCD) and documented in the electronic health record. Patients (mean age: 12.21 +- 7.19 years) were generally White (49.4%) or Black/African American (43.2%), non-Hispanic (94.2%), and 52.3% female. Patients in the SCD group (vs. patients in the HemOnc group) reported significantly higher (p < .05) pretreatment pain (6.95 vs. 4.46), stress (6.47 vs. 4.58), and anxiety (6.67 vs. 4.59). All patients reported clinically and statistically significant (p < .001) mean reductions in pain (-2.25 +- 1.87), stress (-2.50 +- 1.73), and anxiety (-2.52 +- 1.69), with patients in the HemOnc group reporting greater mean pain change (-2.54 vs. -1.87) than patients in the SCD group. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing acute pain, stress, and anxiety among youth with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions. Future research is needed to identify optimal MT utilization.
38613166	Good engraftment after reduced intensity targeted busulfan-based conditioning and matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation in hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). The latest American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend myeloablative preparative regimen in patients under 18 years of age. PROCEDURE: The objective was to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen including high-dose fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, and targeted busulfan as a single alkylator to sub-myeloablative exposures. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2021, 11 patients with SCD and five patients with TDT and matched related donor (MRD) HCT were included. The median age at transplantation was 8.3 years (range: 3.7-18.8 years). The median administered busulfan AUC was 67.4 mg/Lxh (range: 60.7-80 mg/Lxh). Overall survival was 93.8% and event-free survival 87.5% with one engrafted SCD patient with pre-existing moyamoya disease succumbing after drainage of a subdural hematoma. One SCD patient developed a secondary graft failure and was treated with a second HCT. Myeloid chimerism was full in all other patients with a median follow-up time of 4.1 years (range: 2.0-11.1 years), whereas T-cell donor chimerism was frequently mixed. CONCLUSION: This RIC conditioning followed by MRD HCT is sufficiently myeloablative to cure pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies without the need for additional total body irradiation or thiotepa.
31431703	HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies: current practice and new approaches.	We review current approaches in HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) for pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies with a focus on recent developments using TCRalpha/beta+/CD19+ depleted grafts in patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) or sickle cell disease (SCD) in two European transplant units. Eleven TM and three SCD patients (Roma cohort) received a preparative regimen consisting of busulfan/thiotepa/cyclophosphamide/ATG preceded by fludarabine/hydroxyurea/azathioprine. The preparative regimen for 5 SCD patients included treosulfan/thiotepa/fludarabine/ATG (Berlin pilot cohort). All grafts were PBSC engineered by TCR-alpha/beta+/CD19+ depletion. In both cohorts, rates for graft failure, treatment related mortality (TRM) and GvHD were encouraging. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the Roma cohort were 84 and 69%, respectively, while OS and DFS are 100% in the Berlin cohort. Immune reconstitution was satisfactory. Although asymptomatic viral reactivation was common, no severe viral infection occured. These data confirm that TCR-alpha/beta+/CD19+ depletion is a well-suited haplo-HSCT strategy for children with hemoglobinopathies. We discuss the results in the context of additional optimization strategies and introduce our concepts for multicenter trial protocols in Germany.
34224433	The different facets of sickle cell disease-related pulmonary hypertension.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common genetic diseases in the world, is characterized by repeated episodes of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Hemolytic anemia is a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension, and currently SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is classified as World Health Organization group 5 pulmonary hypertension. Patients with SCD-related pulmonary hypertension have unique hemodynamics, multiple comorbidities, and distinct phenotypes that may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mmHg, a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure <=15 mmHg and relatively low pulmonary vascular resistance (>2 Wood units) rather than the traditional definition of >=3 Wood units, an important distinction due to a baseline high-cardiac output state in the setting of chronic anemia and low vascular resistance. Diastolic dysfunction is frequently identified in this patient population and right heart catheterization is essential to determine if combined pre- and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is present. Thromboembolism is common among patients with SCD, and screening for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is essential. Data regarding advanced therapies are limited. Primary treatment options include targeting correction of their primary hemoglobinopathy as well as aggressive management of underlying comorbid conditions. SUMMARY: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is common among patients with SCD and is associated with increased mortality. A high index of suspicion is warranted during evaluation to identify all potential factors that may be contributing to disease.
29803277	Genetic Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is the most prevalent monogenic disorder worldwide and curative therapies are limited to hematopoietic stem cell transplant to the few with matched donors. Gene therapy has curative potential, whereby autologous hematopoietic stem cells are genetically modified and transplanted, which would not be limited by matched donors, resulting in 1-time, life-long correction devoid of immune side effects. Significant progress has been made to clinically translate gene therapy for sickle cell disease using lentivirus vectors carrying antisickling genes. This review focuses on the current state of the field, factors that determine clinical success, gene editing, and future prospects.
37919142	Haematopoietic stem cell health in sickle cell disease and its implications for stem cell therapies and secondary haematological disorders.	Gene modification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a potentially curative approach to sickle cell disease (SCD) and offers hope for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSC transplantation. Current approaches require in vitro manipulation of healthy autologous HSC prior to their transplantation. However, the health and integrity of HSCs may be compromised by a variety of disease processes in SCD, and challenges have emerged in the clinical trials of gene therapy. There is also concern about increased susceptibility to haematological malignancies during long-term follow up of patients, and this raises questions about genomic stability in the stem cell compartment. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for HSC deficits in SCD and then discuss their potential causation. Finally, we suggest several questions which need to be addressed in order to progress with successful HSC manipulation for gene therapy in SCD.
30762720	Neuroimaging Abnormalities in Patients With Nontransfusion-dependent Thalassemia.	Independence from regular transfusions is the hallmark of nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). However, the associated complications need anticipation and screening. One such complication is a hypercoagulable state predisposing to development of thrombosis. We evaluated children with NTDT >10 years of age for prevalence of neuroimaging abnormalities (NIA) and identified associated risk factors. In total, 29 patients were evaluated. Blood counts, serum ferritin, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography was done in all patients. Possible risk factors for thrombosis or cerebrovascular disease were analyzed for association with NIA. The median age was 14 (12 to 15) years. Fifty percent were splenctomized and 31.5% were transfusion naive. Eleven patients (37.9%) had NIA: 6 with silent cerebral infarction (SCI); 2 with cerebral arteriopathy (CA) and 3 having both CA and SCI. Higher white blood cell (WBC) count was associated with NIA (P=0.034) [silent cerebral infarction (P=0.047) and cerebral arteriopathy (P=0.067)]. Presence of 7 or more risk factors had 4.5 times greater risk of a NIA, especially silent cerebral infarction (SCI) (P=0.03). We conclude that cerebral infarction and arteriopathy seem to start in late childhood. There is a need to develop strategies for preventing neurologic complications in NTDT similar to sickle cell disease.
34090531	Genome-based therapeutic interventions for beta-type hemoglobinopathies.	For decades, various strategies have been proposed to solve the enigma of hemoglobinopathies, especially severe cases. However, most of them seem to be lagging in terms of effectiveness and safety. So far, the most prevalent and promising treatment options for patients with beta-types hemoglobinopathies, among others, predominantly include drug treatment and gene therapy. Despite the significant improvements of such interventions to the patient's quality of life, a variable response has been demonstrated among different groups of patients and populations. This is essentially due to the complexity of the disease and other genetic factors. In recent years, a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of the beta-type hemoglobinopathies has led to significant upgrades to the current technologies, as well as the addition of new ones attempting to elucidate these barriers. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to shed light on pharmacogenomics, gene addition, and genome editing technologies, and consequently, their potential use as direct and indirect genome-based interventions, in different strategies, referring to drug and gene therapy. Furthermore, all the latest progress, updates, and scientific achievements for patients with beta-type hemoglobinopathies will be described in detail.
38388223	The role of preoperative transfusion in sickle cell disease, a systematic review and meta-analysis.	This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide guidance on preoperative blood transfusion strategies for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We included all randomized controlled and observational studies exploring the clinical outcomes of preoperative blood transfusion among patients with SCD compared to the conservative transfusion strategy until 14/09/2022. Sixteen studies involving 3486 participants were analysed. The findings revealed a significantly higher bleeding rate in patients who received preoperative transfusion than those who followed a conservative strategy (RR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.75-10.68, P = 0.002, I2 = 0%). However, the two strategies had no significant differences in other clinical outcomes, such as acute chest syndrome, painful crisis, fever, neurological complications, thrombosis, ICU admission, and mortality. It is important to note that all the included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Preoperative transfusion in SCD was associated with a higher bleeding risk but a similar risk in other outcomes compared to conservative strategies. Notably, the increased bleeding risk observed seldom had clinical significance. We recommend individualizing management strategies, considering the overall positive impact of transfusions in reducing complications. Further high-quality studies are needed to refine recommendations.

29556958	Effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants in patients with sickle cell disease and venous thromboembolism: a retrospective cohort study.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience initial and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) more commonly and at a younger age than the general population, and it confers a higher mortality for patients with SCD. However, limited evidence is available to guide anticoagulant use for VTE treatment in this population. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and warfarin for VTE treatment among patients with SCD. This single-center retrospective study includes adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with VTE. Data was obtained from review of electronic health records for the 6 months after VTE diagnosis. Among the 22 patients treated initially with a DOAC, 6 (27%) developed recurrent VTE, none experienced major bleeding, and 3 (14%) experienced clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). Similarly, of 15 patients initially treated with warfarin, 3 (20%) developed a recurrent VTE, 1 (7%) experienced major bleeding, and 2 (13%) experienced CRNMB. Twelve patients received more than one oral anticoagulant during the study period, most commonly due to a recurrent VTE, concern for non-adherence, or subtherapeutic INR. Overall, the incidence of VTE recurrence and bleeding events were similar between groups, but occurred at a higher rate than those found in major clinical trials of anticoagulant agents. Prescribers should continue to individualize therapeutic decision-making regarding oral anticoagulant therapy for VTE treatment for individuals with SCD based on patient-specific factors and anticipated ability to adhere to the drug regimen or required monitoring.
34285054	Safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing in individuals with sickle cell disease: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Maximal CPET using gas exchange analysis is the gold standard for measuring cardiopulmonary fitness in the laboratory, yet its safety in the SCD population is unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov and professional society websites for all published studies and abstracts through December 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Two reviewers independently extracted data of interest from studies that assessed safety outcomes of maximal CPET in children and adults with SCD. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess for risk of bias in studies included. RESULTS: In total, 24 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adverse events were reported separately or as part of study results in 36 (3.8%) of 939 participants with SCD undergoing maximal CPET in studies included. Most adverse events were related to transient ischaemic changes on ECG monitoring or oxygen desaturation during testing, which did not result in arrhythmias or other complications. Only 4 (0.43%) of 939 participants experienced pain events due to maximal CPET. CONCLUSION: Maximal CPET appears to be a safe testing modality in children and adults with SCD and can be used to better understand the physiological basis of reduced exercise capacity and guide exercise prescription in this population. Some studies did not focus on reporting adverse events related to exercise testing or failed to mention safety monitoring, which contributed to risk of bias.

37859469	Cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation in adult patients with sickle cell disease after stem cell transplantation.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia associated with impaired cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with SCD. Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, even in adult patients with SCD. Future follow-up MRI scans will determine whether the observed normalization of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism prevents new silent cerebral infarcts.
30499910	Massive Splenic Infarction in a Child With Sickle Cell Disease on Chronic Transfusion Therapy.	Massive splenic infarction (MSI) is a rare complication of sickle cell disease, as the spleen generally atrophies within the first few years of life. We report a case of MSI in a 12-year-old boy with homozygous sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) whose chronic transfusion therapy resulted in hypersplenism. The occurrence of a complicated MSI in our patient should perhaps further encourage elective splenectomy in such patients, despite known potential perioperative complications and postsplenectomy risks of infection and thrombosis.
29353242	Sickle cell crisis: A crisis of a different sort?	A 9-year-old boy with sickle cell disease (SCD) was presented to the emergency department with acute headache and swelling over his bilateral temporoparietal region. There was no history of antecedent trauma, fever, vomiting or other features of an intercurrent illness. On arrival, his blood pressure was 112/62 mm Hg, heart rate was 98/min and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. There was evidence of significant scalp tenderness over the bilateral temporoparietal region. A complete neurological examination including direct and consensual pupillary response was unremarkable. Initial investigations revealed haemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, leucocyte count of 6.8/mm3, platelet count of 219/mm3 and a normal coagulation profile. His current medications included hydroxyurea and penicillin prophylaxis. He underwent an urgent CT of the head followed by MRI of the brain, which revealed abnormalities as depicted in figures 1,2 edpract;103/6/290/F1F1F1Figure 1CT head. edpract;103/6/290/F2F2F2Figure 2MRI brain. QUESTION 1: Is this one of the most common neurological presentation seen in sickle cell crisis? QUESTION 2: How common is this presentation in paediatric SCD? QUESTION 3: What is the best way to manage this child?
29268067	Partial Red Blood Cell Exchange in Children and Young Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Manual Versus Automated Procedure.	INTRODUCTION: The benefits of manual versus automated red blood cell exchange have rarely been documented and studies in young sickle cell disease patients are scarce. We aim to describe and compare our experience in these two procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Young patients (<= 21 years old) who underwent manual- or automated-red blood cell exchange for prevention or treatment of sickle cell disease complications were included. Clinical, technical and hematological data were prospectively recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-four red blood cell exchange sessions were performed over a period of 68 months, including 57 manual and 37 automated, 63 for chronic complications prevention, 30 for acute complications and one in the pre-operative setting. Mean decrease in sickle hemoglobin levels was higher in automated-red blood cell exchange (p < 0.001) and permitted a higher sickle hemoglobin level decrease per volume removed (p < 0.001), while hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. Ferritin levels on chronic patients decreased 54%. Most frequent concern was catheter outflow obstruction on manual-red blood cell exchange and access alarm on automated-red blood cell exchange. No major complication or alloimunization was recorded. DISCUSSION: Automated-red blood cell exchange decreased sickle hemoglobin levels more efficiently than manual procedure in the setting of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease, with minor technical concerns mainly due to vascular access. The threshold of sickle hemoglobin should be individualized for clinical and hematological goals. In our cohort of young patients, the need for an acceptable venous access was a limiting factor, but iron-overload was avoided. CONCLUSION: Automated red blood cell exchange is safe and well tolerated. It permits a higher sickle hemoglobin removal efficacy, better volume status control and iron-overload avoidance.
28485059	Renal medullary carcinoma: A national analysis of 159 patients.	BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive malignancy seen predominantly in young males with sickle cell trait. RMC is poorly understood, with fewer than 220 cases described in the medical literature to date. We used a large national registry to define the typical presentation, treatments, and outcomes of this rare tumor. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients under 40 years of age diagnosed with RMC from 1998 to 2011. An analysis of patient and tumor characteristics, treatment details, and overall survival (OS) was undertaken, and factors associated with mortality were identified using multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 159 patients with RMC were identified, of whom a majority were male (71%), African American (87%), and had metastatic disease (71%). Median tumor size was 6 cm and median survival was 7.7 months. Most patients underwent surgery (60%) and chemotherapy (65%). Few patients received radiation (12%). Patients with metastatic disease had a significantly worse median survival (4.7 vs. 17.8 months, P < 0.001) and were less likely to receive surgery (42% vs. 91%, P < 0.001). Age and tumor size did not appear to impact OS. CONCLUSION: In the largest cohort to date of patients with RMC, we found a dismal median survival of less than 8 months. Age and tumor size were not associated with OS. Metastatic disease at presentation was the main negative prognostic indicator in RMC and was present in a majority of patients at the time of diagnosis.
31129243	Acute Chest Syndrome After Splenectomy in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk of developing life-threatening complications, particularly acute chest syndrome (ACS) postoperatively. The perioperative factors associated with the development of ACS in children with SCD after splenectomy have not been clearly identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all children who underwent splenectomy at our institution between 1997 and 2017 with the goal of identifying perioperative factors associated with postoperative ACS. Categorical and noncategorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test and Student's two-tailed t-test, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with SCD underwent splenectomy at a median of 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-8.0) years of age. A laparoscopic approach was used for 64 (98.5%) patients. Fifty-six (86.2%) underwent laparoscopic total splenectomy, and eight (12.3%) underwent laparoscopic partial splenectomy, of which two were converted to open. One had an open partial splenectomy (1.5%). Of the 65 patients, 10 (15.4%) developed ACS with a mean time to diagnosis of 49.0 +- 34.5 h. Children who developed ACS had a higher postoperative median pain score of 6.8 (IQR 5.1-9.1) versus 2.7 (IQR 1.6-4.2), P < 0.001, higher median pain score area under the curve 111.5 (IQR 76.9-169.1) versus 47.3 (IQR 30.5-78.3), P = 0.01, and received more total morphine equivalents (median 1.4 [IQR 0.4-2.7] versus 0.5 [IQR 0.3-0.9] mg/kg, respectively; P = 0.003), compared with children who did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Significant postoperative pain may be an early sign of ACS that could be worsened by opioid use, supporting the investigation of nonopioid pain control options in this patient population.
35681538	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene-Addition/Editing Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease.	Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-targeted gene therapy provides a one-time cure for various genetic diseases including sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. SCD is caused by a point mutation (20A > T) in the beta-globin gene. Since SCD is the most common single-gene disorder, curing SCD is a primary goal in HSC gene therapy. beta-thalassemia results from either the absence or the reduction of beta-globin expression, and it can be cured using similar strategies. In HSC gene-addition therapy, patient CD34+ HSCs are genetically modified by adding a therapeutic beta-globin gene with lentiviral transduction, followed by autologous transplantation. Alternatively, novel gene-editing therapies allow for the correction of the mutated beta-globin gene, instead of addition. Furthermore, these diseases can be cured by gamma-globin induction based on gene addition/editing in HSCs. In this review, we discuss HSC-targeted gene therapy in SCD with gene addition as well as gene editing.
30471933	Central venous catheter placement after ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement for difficult vascular access patients.	OBJECTIVES: Ultrasound guided peripheral intravenous catheters (USPIV) are frequently utilized in the Emergency Department (ED) and lead to reduced central venous catheter (CVC) placements. USPIVs, however, are reported to have high failure rates. Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients that required CVC after USPIV. Our secondary objective was to determine if classic risk factors for difficult vascular access were predictive of future CVC placement. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review for patients treated at a large academic hospital. Patients were identified by electronic health record and were restricted to age older than 21 years, had received USPIV, and admittance. Exclusion criteria included an existing CVC. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, chi-square proportions, and logistic regression were performed to test associations. RESULTS: Of 363 eligible patients, 20 were excluded allowing for 343 for analysis. Of 343, 45 (13.1% 95% CI 9.9-17.1%) required CVC after USPIV. For secondary outcomes, no expected characteristics (diabetes, end-stage renal disease, IV drug abuse, peripheral vascular disease, or sickle cell disease) were predictive of CVC placement. The only predictive variables were admission to ICU/stepdown and length of stay. Each additional day of hospitalization had an OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16%) of having a CVC placed. CONCLUSION: Of those admitted after USPIV placement, approximately 7 out of every 8 patients did not require a subsequent CVC. Of the nearly 1 in 8 patients that required a CVC, factors associated with CVC placement were admission to a higher level of care and length of stay.

32928464	A Multiyear Cross-sectional Study of Guideline Adherence for the Timeliness of Opioid Administration in Children With Sickle Cell Pain Crisis.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute evidence-based guidelines for timeliness of opioid administration for sickle cell disease (SCD) pain crises recommend an initial opioid within 1 hour of arrival, with subsequent dosing every 30 minutes until pain is controlled. No multisite studies have evaluated guideline adherence, to our knowledge. Our objective was to determine guideline adherence across a multicenter network. METHODS: We conducted a multiyear cross-sectional analysis of children with SCD who presented between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, to 7 emergency departments (EDs) within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. Visits for uncomplicated pain crisis were included, defined with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 code for SCD crisis and receipt of an opioid, excluding visits with other SCD complications or temperature exceeding 38.5 C (101.3 F). Times were extracted from the electronic record. Guideline adherence was assessed across sites and calendar years. RESULTS: A total of 4,578 visits were included. The median time to first opioid receipt was 62 minutes (interquartile range 42 to 93 minutes); between the first and second opioid receipt, 60 minutes (interquartile range 39 to 93 minutes). Overall, 48% of visits (95% confidence interval 47% to 50%) were guideline adherent for first opioid. Of 3,538 visits with a second opioid, 15% (95% confidence interval 14% to 16%) were guideline adherent. Site variation in adherence existed for time to first opioid (range 22% to 70%) and time between first and second opioid (range 2% to 36%; both P<.001). There was no change in timeliness to first dose or time between doses across years (P>.05 for both). CONCLUSION: Guideline adherence for timeliness of SCD treatment is poor, with half of visits adherent for time to first opioid and one seventh adherent for second dose. Dissemination and implementation research/quality improvement efforts are critical to improve care across EDs.

37800996	Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only readily available curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD). Cure rates following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications. Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience SCD-related symptoms and have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated in SCD, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and autologous gene therapy, in the SCD population reverses the sickle phenotype, prevents further organ damage, can resolve prior organ dysfunction in both pediatric and adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life.
35318744	Preventing antibody positive delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from a case.	INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are important in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, a potentially catastrophic complication of transfusion in this population is the delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). The pathophysiology of all DHTRs is not understood, but some are known to be caused by an anamnestic resurgence of RBC alloantibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: A child with SCD transfused for acute chest syndrome re-presented a week after hospital discharge with severe anaemia, hemolysis, and a newly detected anti-E. This patient had been previously transfused years ago at an outside institution and the anti-E had not been previously documented. DISCUSSION: The presented case of an antibody positive DHTR illustrates several concepts critical to the prevention of this complication. RBC alloantibodies must be detected and this information must be shared. Prophylactic C/c, E/e, K antigen matching is helpful for patients with SCD, but systems must be in place to identify these patients. Patients transfused at multiple different hospitals are especially at risk for this complication and efforts are needed to prevent them from suffering a DHTR.

33425160	[Administration of analgesics at home for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises before admission to hospital].	INTRODUCTION: vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) are the primary reason for admission and hospitalization in children with sickle cell disease and most often they require home care before arriving to consultation. The purpose of this study was to describe home-based therapy for children with sickle cell disease admitted with VOCs. METHODS: we conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, in the pediatric emergencies at the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation (CBF) over a 4-month period from February to May 2018. Consecutive sampling was used. All patients with sickle cell disease presenting with VOCs were included in the study. RESULTS: one hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled. The most represented age group was 5- 10 years. Eighty-two patients (54%) presented more than 24 hours after the onset of the crises and 70 (46%) in the first 24 hours; 80% (n=122) of our sample had received analgesic treatment at home. Escalation of therapy was found in 31.2% of cases. The use of prescription medications (75.4%, n=92) was dominant as the 1st recourse. The dosage for analgesics was not correct in 67% of cases (overdose in 70% of cases). The correct dosage of home-based analgesics was administered in only 33% of patients. CONCLUSION: this study shows that home-based management of VOCs is inadequate. Measures must be taken to ensure that all patients with sickle cell disease can effectively manage minor to moderate VOCs at home.
35110690	Significant improvement of child physical and emotional functioning after familial haploidentical stem cell transplant.	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) represents the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, limited availability of matched related donors and suboptimal outcomes following AlloSCT with unrelated donors has led to investigation of alternative donors. Among children with high-risk SCD, we evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impact in the two years following familial haploidentical SCT. HRQoL was collected from parent and child raters, using the Child Health Ratings Inventories Generic measure and haploidentical SCT-specific module. Repeated measures models were fit to assess HRQoL changes over time and by rater. Nineteen children (mean age 12.9 yrs [standard deviation, 5.3]; 63% male) and their parents were included. There were no differences in the 2-yr trajectories of child physical or emotional functioning (EF) by rater. Child physical functioning and EF scores were significantly lower at day +45 than baseline, but scores recovered by day +180. There was significant improvement in EF (p = 0.03) at 2 yrs vs baseline. A similar pattern of scores over time was seen for parent ratings of child's global HRQoL. Despite treatment intensity in the initial months following AlloSCT, patient scores recovered or exceeded baseline scores at two years. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01461837).
30723187	Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Masquerading as Coronary Artery Stenosis in a Young Patient.	BACKGROUND Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is primarily found in females. SCAD can have many precipitating factors such as exercise, trauma, pregnancy, drugs, and connective tissue disease. Prognosis is poor for left main stem, left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and multivessel involvement, especially for females. CASE REPORT We present a case of young African American male with sickle cell disease who presented with chest pain associated with shortness of breath. He was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was diagnosed with SCAD during catheterization with the help of intravascular ultrasound imaging. Three drug-eluting stents were placed to cover the proximal LAD vessel along its whole length until resolution of the lesion. The patients' hospital course was complicated by an additional finding of left ventricular thrombus, possibly a complication of NSTEMI, which was treated with anticoagulation to complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS SCAD is fatal, it can proceed to cause myocardial infarction as in this particular patient's case, and sudden death if not recognized early. It can be missed on angiography alone; further intracoronary imaging such as intravascular ultrasound and optical computed tomography should be used to confirm the diagnosis of SCAD so that early and appropriate treatment can ensue.
34963615	Combined preoperative plasma exchange and red blood cell exchange transfusion in a renal transplant patient with protein S deficiency and hemoglobin SC disease.	BACKGROUND: Protein S deficiency is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism, complicating the perioperative management of such patients. We present a patient with sickle cell disease (Hb SC genotype) and inherited protein S deficiency who underwent a living-donor renal transplant. To minimize thrombotic risk and sickle cell complications, both plasma exchange and red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion were performed pre-operatively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plasma exchange was utilized to increase protein S levels and to reduce the risk of post-operative venous thromboembolism, including allograft thrombosis, while RBC exchange was performed to reduce the risk of acute post-operative sickle cell disease complications. RESULTS: With the use of combined pre-operative plasma exchange and RBC exchange transfusion, this patient with protein S deficiency and Hb SC underwent a successful renal transplant without acute sickle cell complications or thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the potential use of pre-operative plasma exchange in patients with protein S deficiency undergoing high thrombotic risk procedures.
31054779	Benefits and risks of oxygen therapy during acute medical illness: Just a matter of dose!	Oxygen therapy is used to reverse hypoxemia since more than a century. Current usage is broader and includes routine oxygen administration despite normoxemia which may result in prolonged periods of hyperoxemia. While systematic oxygen therapy was expected to be of benefit in some ischemic diseases such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction, recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged this hypothesis by showing the absence of clinical improvement. Although oxygen is known to be toxic at high inspired oxygen fractions, a recent meta-analysis of RCTs revealed the life-threatening effect of hyperoxemia, with a dose-dependent relationship. Several recommendations have therefore been updated: (i) to monitor peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) as a surrogate for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2); (ii) to initiate oxygen only when the lower SpO2 threshold is crossed; (iii) to titrate the delivered oxygen fraction to maintain SpO2 within a target range; and (iv) to stop supplying oxygen when the upper limit of SpO2 is surpassed, in order to prevent hyperoxemia. The lower and upper limits of SpO2 depend on the presence of risk factors for oxygen-induced hypercapnia (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and obesity-associated hypoventilation). For patients at risk, oxygen therapy should be started when SpO2 is<=88% and stopped when it is>92%. For patients without risk factors, oxygen therapy should be started when SpO2 is<=92% and stopped when it is >96%. High-flow oxygen should only be used in a few diseases such as carbon monoxide poisoning, cluster headaches, sickle cell crisis and pneumothorax.

31642065	Posttransfusion hyperhemolysis is arrested by targeting macrophage activation with novel use of Tocilizumab.	BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a posttransfusion complication most frequently seen in sickle cell disease (SCD), characterized by rapid destruction of transfused and autologous red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in reticulocytopenia and a decrease in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels. Additional RBC transfusion can be life threatening. Most patients improve with intravenous immune globulin and steroids, but in refractory cases, hyperhemolysis may result in multiorgan failure and death in the absence of salvage therapy. The exact pathophysiology of HHS remains uncertain, yet new insights suggest that RBC destruction is driven by activated macrophages. Therefore, we propose that antimacrophage therapy may represent an effective treatment. CASE REPORT: A case of life-threatening HHS, refractory to intravenous immune globulin and steroids, in a patient with SCD is presented. Marked elevation in ferritin, an indirect marker of macrophage activation, a negative direct antiglobulin test, and the absence of RBC alloantibodies was noted. A hemoglobin nadir of 2.1 g/dL and resultant hypoxemia-induced organ failure prompted the use of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier-201, a cell-free polymerized bovine hemoglobin, was used to support the patient during critical anemia. RESULTS: Hemolysis resolved and ferritin dramatically decreased after administration of tocilizumab, which was well tolerated. A full recovery was achieved. CONCLUSION: This case highlights both a novel and successful approach to managing refractory transfusion-induced hyperhemolysis with tocilizumab and provides further evidence supporting the role for macrophage activation in the destruction of RBCs in antibody-negative HHS. We propose that tocilizumab is an effective and rapid salvage therapy for refractory HHS.
28538505	Thalassemia Major and Priapism: A Case Report of an Adolescent.	Priapism is defined as a prolonged pathologic penile erection without sexual stimulation. In children, priapism secondary to sickle cell disease or hematological malignancy is a frequent condition. Appropriate treatment of priapism varies; the treatment is primarily etiological, conservative management. In the present report, we aimed to present a case of asplenic thalassemia major who developed priapism, improved with hydration and ibuprofen treatment. Clinicians should take into account that priapism can be encountered in patients with thalassemia major. To our knowledge this is the second publication reporting the association between thalassemia major and priapism in childhood.
38661449	Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Severe Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) is a nonviral cell therapy designed to reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis by means of ex vivo clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at the erythroid-specific enhancer region of BCL11A. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, single-group, open-label study of exa-cel in patients 12 to 35 years of age with sickle cell disease who had had at least two severe vaso-occlusive crises in each of the 2 years before screening. CD34+ HSPCs were edited with the use of CRISPR-Cas9. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point was freedom from severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months. A key secondary end point was freedom from inpatient hospitalization for severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months. The safety of exa-cel was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients received exa-cel, and the median follow-up was 19.3 months (range, 0.8 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted in each patient. Of the 30 patients who had sufficient follow-up to be evaluated, 29 (97%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83 to 100) were free from vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months, and all 30 (100%; 95% CI, 88 to 100) were free from hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months (P<0.001 for both comparisons against the null hypothesis of a 50% response). The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No cancers occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exa-cel eliminated vaso-occlusive crises in 97% of patients with sickle cell disease for a period of 12 months or more. (CLIMB SCD-121; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03745287.).
34889416	Indications for transfusion in the management of sickle cell disease.	The transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a crucial treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). While often beneficial, the frequent use of transfusions is associated with numerous complications. Transfusions should be offered with specific guidelines in mind. Here we present updates to the indications for transfusion of RBCs in SCD. We review recent publications and include expert perspectives from hematology and transfusion medicine. For some clinical indications, such as ischemic stroke, the role of transfusion has been well studied and can be applied almost universally. For many other clinical scenarios, the use of transfusion therapy has less conclusive data and therefore must be tailored to individual needs. We highlight the roles of RBC transfusions in preventing or mitigating neurological disease, in reducing perioperative complications, in managing acute chest syndrome, and in optimizing pregnancy outcomes in SCD. We further highlight various transfusion techniques and when each might be considered. Potential complications of transfusion are also briefly discussed.
30889039	Epidemiology and Perioperative Complications in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease After Orthopaedic Surgery: 26 Years' Experience at a Major Academic Center.	INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) poses a unique challenge to orthopaedic surgeons due to increased operative and perioperative risk. Studies evaluating perioperative complications among patients with SCD undergoing orthopaedic surgery have been limited. We sought to review the clinical characteristics and perioperative complications in our patients with SCD who required orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Our institution has one of the largest sickle cell centers in the Northeastern United States. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients referred to the Orthopaedic Surgery Department between 1990 and 2016 and analyzed the demographics, comorbidities, surgical intervention, and perioperative complications. RESULTS: In total, 96 orthopaedic surgeries were surveyed across 26 years performed at our institution. The majority of the patients with SCD were African American (90.3%) and women (60.4%). The most common surgical intervention was for hip osteonecrosis. Only 11.5% of the patients (11 of 96) experienced a perioperative complication, with the vasoocclusive event being the most common (7 patients; 64%). DISCUSSION: These data suggest that orthopaedic surgery for a patient with SCD is safe but does require careful multidisciplinary consultation including hematology and anesthesia to medically optimize the patient before surgical intervention.
29807062	Hemoglobin disorders: lentiviral gene therapy in the starting blocks to enter clinical practice.	The beta-hemoglobinopathies, transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are the most prevalent inherited disorders worldwide and affect millions of people. Many of these patients have a shortened life expectancy and suffer from severe morbidity despite supportive therapies, which impose an enormous financial burden to societies. The only available curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although most patients do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor, and those who do still risk life-threatening complications. Therefore, gene therapy by one-time ex vivo modification of hematopoietic stem cells followed by autologous engraftment is an attractive new therapeutic modality. The first proof-of-principle of conversion to transfusion independence by means of a lentiviral vector expressing a marked and anti-sickling betaT87Q-globin gene variant was reported a decade ago in a patient with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. In follow-up multicenter Phase II trials with an essentially identical vector (termed LentiGlobin BB305) and protocol, 12 of the 13 patients with a non-beta0/beta0 genotype, representing more than half of all transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia cases worldwide, stopped red blood cell transfusions with total hemoglobin levels in blood approaching normal values. Correction of biological markers of dyserythropoiesis was achieved in evaluated patients. In nine patients with beta0/beta0 transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia or equivalent severity (betaIVS1-110), median annualized transfusion volume decreased by 73% and red blood cell transfusions were stopped in three patients. Proof-of-principle of therapeutic efficacy in the first patient with sickle cell disease was also reported with LentiGlobin BB305. Encouraging results were presented in children with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in another trial with the GLOBE lentiviral vector and several other gene therapy trials are currently open for both transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Phase III trials are now under way and should help to determine benefit/risk/cost ratios to move gene therapy toward clinical practice.
38066905	Using disease-modifying therapies in sickle cell disease.	As curative therapy using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as gene therapy and gene editing remains inaccessible to most patients with sickle cell disease, the availability of drug therapies that are safe, efficacious, and affordable is highly desirable. Increasing progress is being made in developing drug therapies based on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Four drugs, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes.
30198363	Orthotropic Liver Transplantation for Acute Intrahepatic Cholestasis in Sickle Cell Disease: Clinical and Histopathologic Features of a Rare Case.	Sickle cell disease has a wide range of hepatic manifestations, with acute intrahepatic cholestasis being one of the rarest and most fatal, often resulting in acute fulminant hepatic failure. Liver transplantation is an emerging but rarely utilized treatment for hepatic failure in the setting of sickle cell disease. Few such cases have been reported in the literature, with little emphasis on histopathologic correlation. We report a case of acute intrahepatic cholestasis in a patient with sickle cell disease who underwent orthotropic liver transplantation and describe novel correlating histopathologic features. The patient is a 29-year-old man who presented with hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. He was diagnosed clinically with acute intrahepatic cholestasis and received an orthotropic liver transplant. The explanted liver demonstrated marked sinusoidal expansion by sickled erythrocytes, hyperplastic Kupffer cells, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. There was extensive sinusoidal and centrizonal fibrosis with occlusion of central veins reminiscent of chronic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, a previously undescribed pattern of injury. This case represents one of the few reported cases of sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis treated by transplantation and demonstrates the rarely reported histopathologic features and gives insight to a potentially new mechanism of injury in these patients. Familiarity with the morphologic features of sickle cell hepatopathy and its clinical manifestations is important as transplantation in sickle cell-related liver injury increases in frequency.
31322165	Gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies: progress and future challenges.	Recently, gene therapy clinical trials have been successfully applied to hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. Among the great discoveries that led to the design of genetic approaches to cure these disorders is the discovery of the beta-globin locus control region and several associated transcription factors, which determine hemoglobin switching as well as high-level, erythroid-specific expression of genes at the ss-globin locus. Moreover, increasing evidence shows that lentiviral vectors are efficient tools to insert large DNA elements into nondividing hematopoietic stem cells, showing reassuring safe integration profiles. Alternatively, genome editing could restore expression of fetal hemoglobin or target specific mutations to restore expression of the wild-type beta-globin gene. The most recent clinical trials for beta-thalassemia and SCD are showing promising outcomes: patients were able to discontinue transfusions or had reduced transfusion requirements. However, toxic myeloablation and the high cost of current ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy platforms represent a barrier to a widespread application of these approaches. In this review, we summarize these gene therapy strategies and ongoing clinical trials. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to improve outcomes, reduce myeloablative regimens and future challenges to reduce the cost of gene therapy platform.
30134792	Erythropoiesis: insights into pathophysiology and treatments in 2017.	Erythropoiesis is a tightly-regulated and complex process originating in the bone marrow from a multipotent stem cell and terminating in a mature, enucleated erythrocyte.Altered red cell production can result from the direct impairment of medullary erythropoiesis, as seen in the thalassemia syndromes, inherited bone marrow failure as well as in the anemia of chronic disease. Alternatively, in disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD) as well as enzymopathies and membrane defects, medullary erythropoiesis is not, or only minimally, directly impaired. Despite these differences in pathophysiology, therapies have traditionally been non-specific, limited to symptomatic control of anemia via packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion, resulting in iron overload and the eventual need for iron chelation or splenectomy to reduce defective red cell destruction. Likewise, in polycythemia vera overproduction of red cells has historically been dealt with by non-specific myelosuppression or phlebotomy. With a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology, new therapeutic targets have been identified including induction of fetal hemoglobin, interference with aberrant signaling pathways and gene therapy for definitive cure. This review, utilizing some representative disorders of erythropoiesis, will highlight novel therapeutic modalities currently in development for treatment of red cell disorders.
33348066	Trial design of comparing patient-specific versus weight-based protocols to treat vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease (COMPARE-VOE).	OBJECTIVES: Painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) are the most common reason for emergency department (ED) visits experienced by patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) evidence-based recommendations for VOE treatment are based primarily on expert opinion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will compare changes in pain scores between patients randomized to a patient-specific analgesic protocol versus those randomized to a weight-based analgesic protocol, as recommended by the NHLBI guidelines. METHODS: We report the rationale and design of a multi-site, phase III, single-blinded, RCT to be conducted in six EDs in the United States. Eligible participants will be randomized after providing consent, anticipating 50% of those randomized would have an ED visit during the enrollment period. A total of 230 participants with one VOE ED visit provides sufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference in pain score reductions of 14 between groups with 0.05 type I error. Uniquely, this trial randomizes participants in a larger population than the study population, given the impossibility of consenting and randomizing participants during emergencies. The primary endpoint is the change in pain scores in the ED from time of placement in treatment area to time of disposition (hospitalization, discharged home, or assigned to observation status) or a maximum treatment duration of 6 hours. Additional outcomes include hospitalizations and ED visits seven days post enrollment, side effects, and safety assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The COMPARE-VOE study design will provide high-level evidence to support the NHLBI VOE treatment guidelines.
34581773	American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for sickle cell disease: stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-limiting inherited hemoglobinopathy that results in significant complications and affects quality of life. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative intervention for SCD; however, guidelines are needed to inform how to apply HSCT in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health professionals in their decisions about HSCT for SCD. METHODS: The multidisciplinary guideline panel formed by ASH included 2 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (through 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence review yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest syndrome at an early age and to improve nonmyeloablative regimens. Future research should include the development of a robust SCD registry to serve as a comparator for HSCT studies.
38358434	Ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: safety, ovarian function follow-up, and results of ovarian tissue transplantation.	PURPOSE: To describe the experience of performing ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), among girls/women with severe sickle cell disease (SCD)(SS or S/beta0-thalassemia) who are, besides the usual surgical risk, at risk of SCD-related complications during the fertility preservation procedure for improving their counseling and management. METHODS: This retrospective study included 75 patients (girls/women) with SCD who have had OTC before myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) for HSCT. Characteristics of patients and data on OTC, ovarian status follow-up, and results of ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) were collected in medical records. RESULTS: At OTC, the median (IQR 25-75; range) age of the patients was 9.6 (6.9-14.1; 3.6-28.3) years, 56/75 were prepubertal, and no SCD or surgery-related complications occurred. The median follow-up post-HSCT was > 9 years. At the last follow-up, among prepubertal patients at HSCT, 26/56 were >= 15 years old and presented with a premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), except 2, including the patient who had received an OTT to induce puberty. Eight were 13-15 years old and presented for POI. The remaining 22 patients were under 13. Among the 19 patients who were menarche at HSCT, 2 died 6 months post-HSCT and we do not have ovarian function follow-up for the other 2 patients. All the remaining patients (n = 15) had POI. Five patients had OTT. All had a return of ovarian function. One patient gave birth to a healthy baby. CONCLUSION: OTC is a safe fertility preservation technique and could be offered before MAC independent of the patient's age.
38517255	Effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on sickle cell disease-related organ complications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Sickle cell disease (SCD)-related organ complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD. We sought to assess whether hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) stabilizes, attenuates, or exacerbates organ decline. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials investigating organ function before and after HSCT in patients with SCD. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE up to September 21, 2023. Continuous data were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled in a weighted inverse-variance random-effects model; binomial data were expressed as risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analyses. Of 823 screened studies, 34 were included in this review. Of these, 17 (774 patients, 23.6% adults, 86.3% HLA-identical sibling donor, 56.7% myeloablative conditioning regimen) were included in the meta-analyses. Pulmonary function remained stable. Mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity decreased but did not reach statistical significance. In children, estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (SMD -0.80, p = .01), and the presence of proteinuria increased (RR 2.00, p = <.01), while splenic uptake and phagocytic function improved (RR 0.31, p = <.01; RR 0.23, p = <.01). Cerebral blood flow improved (SMD -1.39, p = <.01), and a low incidence of stroke after transplantation in high-risk patients was found. Retinopathy and avascular osteonecrosis were investigated in only one study, showing no significant changes. While HSCT can improve some SCD-related organ dysfunctions, transplantation-related toxicity may have an adverse effect on others. Future research should focus on identifying individuals with SCD who might benefit most from HSCT and which forms of organ damage are more likely to exacerbate post-transplantation.
31489626	Transfusion practices in the care of pregnant women with sickle cell disease in Ouagadougou.	OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of blood transfusion management in the improvement of maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease in Ouagadougou. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study with data collected from February 2012 to January 2014 was used. Patients were differentiated into three groups: patients with at least one exchange transfusion, patients who received blood transfusion, and patients who did not receive any transfusion. Data were collected from patients' patient care documents. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four patients were included, of whom 53 were in the first group, 32 in the second group, and 79 in the third group. Maternal complications in the last trimester of pregnancy were significantly less important (P=0.000) in the first group (58.5%) than in the second (78.5%) and third group (91.1%). The same trend was observed for postpartum maternal mortality (5.7%; 12.5%; 12.6%; P=0.009). Fetal complications such as preterm birth and early neonatal death were lower in the first group (15.1%; 1.8%) than in the second (40.6%; 23.1%) and third group (32.9%; 7.6%). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic blood transfusion is an important part of the management of pregnant patients with sickle cell disease.

34565708	Combination Therapy With Bortezomib in Renal Medullary Carcinoma: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a very rare, aggressive neoplasm occurring almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell trait. Given the rare nature of this tumor, accounting for less than 0.5% of all renal carcinomas, most of the published data on therapies is from case reports and small case series, and current treatments are insufficient, with most patients succumbing to their disease in months. We report our experience with a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen consisting of platinum-based therapy, doxorubicin, and bortezomib. METHODS: Three patients with metastatic RMC at a single institution were treated off-label with a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for 4 cycles of 2 alternating regimens: regimen A consisting of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and bortezomib; regimen B consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. A radical nephrectomy was performed on all patients. Surveillance imaging was performed on all patients to assess response and disease burden. Patients received up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with everolimus. RESULTS: Three African American patients - 2 males and 1 female aged 14, 28, and 31 - with sickle cell trait and metastatic disease were treated with this regimen. The median follow-up was 18 months. All had resection of the primary tumor - 2 patients after receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and one patient underwent resection prior to referral. All 3 patients achieved complete responses based on imaging, 2 of which lasted for 12 months, and another is still in remission over 7 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of alternating cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy with bortezomib appeared to be active against RMC and was generally well-tolerated. Given the extremely rare nature of this disease and dismal prognosis, new treatment modalities should be pursued, and whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial. We propose that a multiinstitution clinical trial of this regiment may be warranted.
28687959	Stem Cell Therapy for Fanconi Anemia.	Stem cell therapy is the administration of stem cells to a patient to treat or prevent a disease. Since stem cells possess the long-term self-renewal capacity and provide daughter cells that differentiate into the specialized cells of each tissue, stem cell therapy will theoretically improve the disease condition for the lifetime of the patient. As the most widely used stem cell therapy, bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for many kinds of blood disorders, including anemias, leukemias, lymphomas, and rare immunodeficiency diseases. For the fatal genetic blood disorder Fanconi anemia, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has remained the only curative treatment. But the recent advances in stem cell and gene therapy fields may provide promising opportunities for an alternative or even better management of Fanconi anemia. Many of these new ideas and opportunities are also useful for treating other blood diseases that affect hematopoietic stem cells, such as sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and beta-thalassemias. In this chapter, these advances along with their challenges and limitations will be thoroughly discussed.
30586175	Who Deserves Access to Care in Children's Hospitals?	"An eighteen-year-old with sickle cell disease was admitted to the pediatric hematology service at his local children's hospital for management of an acute pain crisis, one of many such admissions. He had a good relationship with his primary hematologist and primary nurse, but with other health care providers, there was evident friction. Sometimes, he was simply rude, rolling over and pretending to sleep in response to questions about his symptoms. When frustrated or convinced that his pain was not being addressed appropriately, he was prone to yelling and cursing at his nurses. After members of the health care team complained, their supervisor decided to transfer the patient to an adult general medicine service. Reasons cited for the transition included the stressful work environment created by the patient's actions, his refusal to follow directives from staff (although he was generally adherent to treatment), and the hypothetical harm to other young patients who might witness his behavior. Was this a just outcome? Is it ever permissible to deny access to pediatric care to a patient whose best interests would be served by it? Can access be withheld for ""bad"" behavior, and can transfer of care be wielded as a punishment?"
32691114	Manual erythroexchange in sickle cell disease: multicenter validation of a protocol predictive of volume to exchange and hemoglobin values.	Manual erythroexchange (MEEX) was proven to be effective and safe in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD). The goal is to quickly reduce the percentage of hemoglobin S (HbS%). A national survey of the Italian Society for Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies (SITE) observed a great variability among MEEX protocols none of which were found to be predictive of the values of HbS% and hemoglobin (Hb) after the exchange. Two equations to estimate the HbS% and Hb values to be obtained after MEEX were developed based on the results of the MEEX procedures in place in the centers participating in the present study. A standard protocol was subsequently defined to evaluate the volumes to exchange to obtain the target values of HbS% and Hb. The protocol was tested in 261 MEEX performed in SCD patients followed in the 5 participating centers that belong to the Italian Hemoglobinopathy Comprehensive Care Network, with the support of the SITE. The results showed a correlation between the estimated and measured values of HbS% and Hb (Rp 0.95 and 0.65 respectively, p < 0.001). A negligible bias was found for the prediction of HbS% and a bias of 1 g/dl for Hb. From consecutive MEEX, a rate of increase of HbS% between two exchanges of around 0.4% per day (p < 0.001) was measured. This protocol was shown to be effective and safe, as all patients reached the target value of HbS%. All the MEEX procedures were carried out with single venous access. No adverse events or reactions such as hypotension or electrolyte imbalance were reported nor were any complaints concerning the procedures received from patients.
31836598	Acute Kidney Injury and CKD Associated with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for many patients with cancer, as well as patients with some nonmalignant hematologic disorders, such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and certain congenital immune deficiencies. Kidney injury directly associated with stem cell transplantation includes a wide range of structural and functional abnormalities, which may be vascular (hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy), glomerular (albuminuria, nephrotic glomerulopathies), and/or tubulointerstitial. AKI occurs commonly after stem cell transplant, affecting 10%-73% of patients. The cause is often multifactorial and can include sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, marrow infusion syndrome, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, infections, and graft versus host disease. The risk of post-transplant kidney injury varies depending on patient characteristics, type of transplant (allogeneic versus autologous), and choice of chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen (myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative). Importantly, AKI is associated with substantial morbidity, including the need for KRT in approximately 5% of patients and the development of CKD in up to 60% of transplant recipients. AKI has been associated universally with higher all-cause and nonrelapse mortality regardless of transplant type, and studies have consistently shown extremely high (>80%) mortality rates in those patients requiring acute dialysis. Accordingly, prevention, early recognition, and prompt treatment of kidney injury are essential to improving kidney and patient outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and for realizing the full potential of this therapy.

28574532	Association Between Opioid and Benzodiazepine Use and Clinical Deterioration in Ward Patients.	"BACKGROUND: Opioids and benzodiazepines are frequently used in hospitals, but little is known about outcomes among ward patients receiving these medications. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between opioid and benzodiazepine administration and clinical deterioration. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: 500-bed academic urban tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All adults hospitalized on the wards from November 2008 to January 2016 were included. Patients who were ""comfort care"" status, had tracheostomies, sickle-cell disease, and patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal or seizures were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit transfer or ward cardiac arrest. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to calculate the odds of this outcome during exposed time periods compared to unexposed time periods with respect to the medications of interest, with adjustment for patient demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness, and pain score. RESULTS: In total, 120,518 admissions from 67,097 patients were included, with 67% of admissions involving opioids, and 21% involving benzodiazepines. After adjustment, each equivalent of 15 mg oral morphine was associated with a 1.9% increase in the odds of the primary outcome within 6 hours (odds ratio [OR], 1.019; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.013-1.026; P < 0.001), and each 1 mg oral lorazepam equivalent was associated with a 29% increase in the odds of the composite outcome within 6 hours (OR, 1.29; CI, 1.16- 1.45; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among ward patients, opioids were associated with increased risk for clinical deterioration in the 6 hours after administration. Benzodiazepines were associated with even higher risk. These results have implications for ward-monitoring strategies. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:428-434."

38296295	Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.	INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
34958973	Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Is Safe and Well Tolerated following Allogeneic Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can enhance neutrophil recovery in patients rendered neutropenic by the preparative regimen. G-CSF is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), because life-threatening complications can ensue in the presence of sickle vasculopathy. The safety profile of G-CSF after HSCT for SCD has not been described, however. We report clinical outcomes in the first 100 days post-HSCT in 62 patients supported with G-CSF until neutrophil recovery on a clinical trial of reduced- intensity conditioning HSCT for SCD. The patients received G-CSF for a median of 9 days (range, 5 to 33 days) post-transplantation from the best available stem cell source. Preparation for transplantation included a target hemoglobin S level of <=45%. Neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 13 days (range, 10 to 34 days), and platelet engraftment (>50 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 19 days (range, 12 to 71 days). The median duration of inpatient hospitalization following stem cell infusion (day 0) was 21.5 days (range, 11 to 33 days). No patient developed SCD-related complications following G-CSF use. The most common organ toxicities encountered between G-CSF initiation (on day +7) and day +100 were anorexia (n = 14), hypertension (n = 11), and electrolyte imbalance requiring correction (n = 9). Central nervous system-related events were noted in 5 patients, all of whom had preexisting cerebral vasculopathy/moyamoya disease, attributed to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in the presence of calcineurin inhibitor therapy and hypertension. We conclude that G-CSF does not adversely impact SCD HSCT recipients and can be safely used post-transplantation to enhance neutrophil recovery.
30345909	Maternal sickle cell disease and twin pregnancy: a case series and review of the literature.	OBJECTIVES: Maternal sickle cell disease (SCD) and multiple gestations are well known separately as causes of high-risk pregnancies, however, there is sparse information available on maternal and perinatal outcome when both conditions occur together. This case series describes the outcomes of women with maternal SCD and twin pregnancy in the largest single-center case series to date. METHODS: Retrospective identification of all twin pregnancies in maternal SCD patients between 2006 and 2016 at Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, United Kingdom Results: Eight women were included: seven with HbSS and one with HbSC. Our cohort experienced common SCD-related and pregnancy-related complications such as painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome (ACS), and pre-eclampsia and less common complications such as peri-partum cardiomyopathy and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. Only two out of eight women had relatively uncomplicated pregnancies. Seven out of eight women required transfusion antenatally and there was no maternal or perinatal mortality. A review of the available literature highlighted the lack of available information on this uncommon cohort. It was evident that outcomes have improved over the years, where historical studies demonstrate higher rates of maternal and perinatal mortality. DISCUSSION: The antenatal and postnatal complications described in our study and literature review highlights the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these high-risk pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Our case series highlights the advantage of closer monitoring and comprehensive multidisciplinary care in delivering improved clinical outcomes.
38359264	Hematopoietic stem cell collection for sickle cell disease gene therapy.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) is advancing rapidly, with two transformative products recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and numerous others under study. All current gene therapy protocols require ex vivo modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, several SCD-related problems impair HSC collection, including a stressed and damaged bone marrow, potential cytotoxicity by the major therapeutic drug hydroxyurea, and inability to use granulocyte colony stimulating factor, which can precipitate severe vaso-occlusive events. RECENT FINDINGS: Peripheral blood mobilization of HSCs using the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor followed by apheresis collection was recently shown to be safe and effective for most SCD patients and is the current strategy for mobilizing HSCs. However, exceptionally large numbers of HSCs are required to manufacture an adequate cellular product, responses to plerixafor are variable, and most patients require multiple mobilization cycles, increasing the risk for adverse events. For some, gene therapy is prohibited by the failure to obtain adequate numbers of HSCs. SUMMARY: Here we review the current knowledge on HSC collection from individuals with SCD and potential improvements that may enhance the safety, efficacy, and availability of gene therapy for this disorder.
29701080	Adherence to iron chelation therapy in patients who switched from deferasirox dispersible tablets to deferasirox film-coated tablets.	OBJECTIVE: To compare real-world adherence to and persistence with deferasirox film-coated tablets (DFX-FCT) and deferasirox dispersible tablets (DFX-DT) among patients who switched from DFX-DT to DFX-FCT, overall and by disease type (sickle cell disease [SCD], thalassemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]). METHODS: Patients were >=2 years old and had >=2 DFX-FCT claims over the study period and >=2 DFX-DT claims before the index date (first DFX-FCT claim). The DFX-DT period was defined from the first DFX-DT claim to the index date; the DFX-FCT period was defined from the index date to the end of the study period. Adherence was measured as medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC). Persistence was defined as continuous medication use without a gap >=30 or 60 days between refills. Comparisons were conducted using paired-sample Wilcoxon sign-rank and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: In total, 606 patients were selected (SCD: 348; thalassemia: 107; MDS: 106; other: 45). Adherence and persistence in the DFX-FCT vs DFX-DT period was significantly higher across all measures: mean MPR was 0.80 vs 0.76 (p < .001); 60.9% vs 54.3% of patients had MPR >= 0.8 (p = .009); mean 3-month PDC was 0.83 vs 0.71 (p < .001); 64.2% vs 45.4% of patients had 3-month PDC >= 0.8 (p < .001); 87.2% vs 63.4% of patients had 3-month persistence with no gap >=30 days and 96.1% vs 79.9% with no gap >=60 days (p < .001). Adherence and persistence improved after switching across all diseases, particularly MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence and persistence improved significantly after switching from DFX-DT to DFX-FCT for all diseases, but especially MDS.
30945451	Catastrophic sickling crisis in patient undergoing cardiac transplantation with sickle cell trait.	There is debate in the literature regarding management of patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) undergoing cardiac surgery, since it is recognized that cardiopulmonary bypass presents many precipitating risk factors for a sickling crisis. Despite this, many report successful outcomes without any modification to perioperative management. A 49-year-old woman with SCT (HbS 38%) with postpartum cardiomyopathy underwent cardiac transplantation. The patient was cooled to 34.0 C and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia was infused continuously. The cold ischemic time was 219 minutes and warm ischemic time 46 minutes. After weaning from bypass, she developed global cardiac dysfunction requiring veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The circuit suddenly stopped, requiring emergency reinstitution of bypass; the circuit had clotted. Transesophageal-echocardiogram revealed thrombus within the left atrium and ventricle. There was no recovery of cardiac function and the patient developed multiorgan failure. At postmortem there was extensive myocardial infarction with evidence of widespread catastrophic intravascular red-cell sickling. This case highlights the danger of complacency in patients with SCT, offering a learning opportunity for the cardiothoracic community to highlight the most serious complication that can occur in this group of patients. We have learned that SCT and cardiac surgery is not a benign combination.
32138685	Renal medullary carcinoma masquerading as renal infection: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma is a rare and aggressive tumor and often seen in young adults with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of renal medullary carcinoma in a 29-year old male patient with an occupying renal lesion who presented with fever, flank pain and hematuria. The patient received intensive antibiotics treatment, but no improvement was seen. The symptoms disappeared after laparoscopic radical left nephrectomy. Postoperative pathological study showed that the mass was renal medullary carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that renal medullary carcinoma should be considered in differential diagnoses of patients with occupying renal lesions who have fever of unknown origin.
31742673	Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in a person who has inherited two mutant globin genes (one from each parent), at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, and SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are attributable to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back or chest, but it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction to rehydrating the patient and reduce the sickling process. OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions to treat acute painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid and LILACS, from inception to September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of pharmacological interventions, of any dose and by any route, compared to placebo or any active comparator, for the treatment (not prevention) of painful sickle cell VOC in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies with data for 638 VOC events and 594 participants aged 17 to 42 years with SCD presenting to a hospital emergency department in a painful VOC. Three studies investigated a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) compared to placebo. One study compared an opioid with a placebo, two studies compared an opioid with an active comparator, two studies compared an anticoagulant with a placebo, and one study compared a combination of three drugs with a combination of four drugs. Risk of bias across the nine studies varied. Studies were primarily at an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias. Studies were primarily at a high risk of bias for size with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm; two studies had 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm (unclear risk). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The efficacy was uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved, and PGIC much or very much improved (no difference; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-quality evidence). Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the NSAIDs group (16/45 adverse events, 1/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events) and the placebo group (19/45 adverse events, 2/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events). Opioids compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30%, PGIC, or adverse events (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events). Opioids compared with active comparator No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The results were uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved (33% of the opioids group versus 19% of the placebo group). No data were reported regarding PGIC much or very much improved. Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the opioids group (9/66 adverse events, and 0/66 serious adverse events) and the placebo group (7/64 adverse events, 0/66 serious adverse events). No data were reported regarding withdrawal due to adverse events. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality because there are too few data to have confidence in results (e.g. too few participants per treatment arm). Where no data were reported for an outcome, we had no evidence to support or refute (quality of the evidence is unknown). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identified only nine studies, with insufficient data for all pharmacological interventions for analysis. The available evidence is very uncertain regarding the efficacy or harm from pharmacological interventions used to treat pain related to sickle cell VOC in adults. This area could benefit most from more high quality, certain evidence, as well as the establishment of suitable registries which record interventions and outcomes for this group of people.

28645902	The cause of the stroke: a diagnostic uncertainty.	A 39-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease (SCD) presented with left leg weakness. He had a normal CT head and CT angiogram, but MRI head showed multiple acute bilateral cortical infarcts including in the right precentral gyrus. The MRI findings were more in keeping with an embolic source rather than stroke related to SCD, although it could not be ruled out. He also had an echocardiogram which revealed a patent foramen ovale. He was treated with antiplatelet therapy and also had red blood cell exchange transfusion. His symptoms improved significantly and he was discharged with follow-up as an outpatient and a cardiology review.
31362014	Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Sickle Cell Disease for Urgent Cardiac Surgery.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is among the most common genetic diseases, with a recent increase in life expectancy. Patients may therefore need similar surgical procedures as does the general population, including cardiac surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a homeostasis challenge for SCD patients, with high risk of vasoocclusive crisis. In the most severe cases of cardiogenic shock, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) may be required, with prolonged exposure to extreme nonphysiological conditions. We report a case of postcardiotomy shock in an SCD patient successfully managed with VA-ECMO. This highlights that SCD should not be a counterindication to VA-ECMO, pending multidisciplinary management.
29888721	A 3-year study of deferasirox therapy in sickle cell disease patients in Basra, Southern Iraq.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may require repeated transfusions, which inevitably lead to iron overload (IOL). AIMS: : This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox (DFX) in patients with SCD and transfusional IOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study has been performed on patients with SCD who have completed at least 3 years on DFX. Height and weight were checked every 3-6 months. The efficacy was assessed based on serum ferritin (SF) levels. The safety was assessed based on adverse events (AEs), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine (S. Cr) levels. RESULTS: : A total of 102 patients (61 males and 41 females) were recruited. Their mean daily iron intake was 0.13 +- 0.06 mg/kg. SF levels declined significantly from 2434.1 +- 132.9 ng/ml at the start of the study to 1655.8 +- 154.2 ng/ml at the end of the study (P < 0.05), with significant decreases observed after increasing the DFX dose to >= 30 mg/kg/day. ALT (12.8 +- 9.9 vs. 12.1 +- 7.1 U/L) and S. Cr (72.4 +- 9.2 vs. 74.1 +- 7.9 mmol/L) levels did not show significant differences from the start to the end of the study (P > 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (37%) developed AEs. The most common were abdominal pain (24.5%), diarrhea (8.0%), and nausea (7.8%). AEs were predominantly transient and mild to moderate in nature. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed that DFX is a safe, tolerable, and effective drug for reducing IOL in SCD patients, though it is associated with mild and transient adverse events.
30616959	More efficient exchange of sickle red blood cells can be achieved by exchanging the densest red blood cells: An ex vivo proof of concept study.	"BACKGROUND: In sickle cell disease (SCD), red blood cells (RBCs) containing hemoglobin S can be denser than RBCs containing wild-type hemoglobin, especially when dehydrated. We hypothesize that targeting denser RBCs during red blood cell (RBC) exchange for SCD could result in more efficient removal of dehydrated, sickled RBCs and preservation of non-sickled RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Waste products from RBC exchanges for SCD were used as ""simulated patients"". One RBC volume was exchanged using ABO-compatible blood. The apheresis instrument was programmed to exchange the entire RBC layer by indicating the hematocrit (control), or the bottom half by indicating the hematocrit was half the hematocrit (experimental), with or without subsequent transfusion. Hemoglobin S levels, and complete blood counts were measured. RESULTS: Hemoglobin S levels were lower after the modified versus control RBC exchange (post-RBC exchange mean 4.96% and 11.27%); total hemoglobin S amounts were also lower (mean 19.27 and 58.29 mL of RBCs). Mean RBC density decreased after the modified RBC exchange by 8.86%. Hematocrit decreased in the modified RBC exchange by 36.37%, with partial correction by direct transfusion following a truncated RBC exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting denser RBCs in RBC exchange enhanced hemoglobin S removal and decreased RBC density. Further development of this ex vivo model could potentially allow for: 1) improved reduction in hemoglobin S levels (allowing for longer periods between RBC exchange or maintained lower levels), or 2) achievement of previous goal hemoglobin S levels with fewer donor units (reducing alloimmunization risk and improving blood utilization)."
28805282	Autologous breast reconstruction in sickle cell trait: A fine line between success & failure.	Autologous breast reconstructions are increasingly being performed. While increased risks for flap loss after free tissue transfer (FTT) in sickle cell patients are known to most plastic surgeons, risks for patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) are less known. Unfortunately, recommendations to prevent complications after FTT in SCT are still scarce. We present additional and novel surgical measures that we took aiming to enhance probabilities for successful FTT in a SCT patient undergoing autologous breast reconstruction. This is only the second case report describing a successful FTT without flap necrosis/loss in a patient with SCT, and the first successful report involving FTT in the breast.
33742546	The comfort ability program for adolescents with sickle cell pain: Evaluating feasibility and acceptability of an inpatient group-based clinical implementation.	BACKGROUND: Integration of nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies, is recommended to support comprehensive disease and pain management among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). The Comfort Ability Program for Sickle Cell Pain (CAP for SCP) introduces psychological and biobehavioral pain management strategies to children and adolescents with SCD. This study aimed to pilot the implementation of the CAP for SCP in a group setting to children and adolescents hospitalized for SCD pain examining feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness on improving pain knowledge and coping efficacy. METHOD: Adaptation of CAP for SCP into a three-session group format was guided by four phases of the Dynamic Adaptation Process model: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment. Youth with SCD (n = 57) hospitalized for pain participated in at least one session and completed self-report of knowledge of pain management skills, pain coping efficacy, and treatment acceptance. Completion rates of sessions and qualitative feedback were gathered to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS: Feasibility of conducting inpatient group sessions was suboptimal; however, patients and medical providers reported moderate to high levels of treatment acceptance. Patients also reported significant improvements in knowledge of pain management skills following session 1. CONCLUSIONS: CAP for SCP is a patient-centered first-line psychoeducational intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice settings to introduce youth to cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies to support SCD pain management.
32205585	Current and future gene therapies for hemoglobinopathies.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this work we briefly summarize the key features and currently available conventional therapies for the two main beta-hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, and review the rapidly evolving field of novel and emerging genetic therapies to cure the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene therapy using viral vectors or designer nuclease-based gene editing is a relatively new field of medicine that uses the patient's own genetically modified cells to treat his or her own disease. Multiple different approaches are currently in development, and some have entered phase I clinical studies, including innovative therapies aiming at induction of fetal hemoglobin. SUMMARY: Early short-term therapeutic benefit has been reported for some of the ongoing clinical trials, but confirmation of long-term safety and efficacy remains to be shown. Future therapies aiming at the targeted correction of specific disease-causing DNA mutations are emerging and will likely enter clinical testing in the near future.
33470527	Pretransplant myeloid and immune suppression, reduced toxicity conditioning with posttransplant cyclophosphamide: Initial outcomes of novel approach for matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hemoglobinopathies.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative option for thalassemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). We report our experience of using pretransplant immune suppression (PTIS), augmented Johns Hopkins conditioning, and posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis for matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant in TM/SCD. At a median follow-up of 307.5 days (range 251-395), all patients (three TM, one SCD) are alive and disease free. MUD HSCT with PTIS, augmented Johns Hopkins conditioning, and PTCy as GvHD prophylaxis is a promising way of treating patients with hemoglobinopathies with low regimen-related toxicity (RRT), no risk of graft failure (GF) and minimal GvHD rates.
34550539	Red blood cell exchange in children with sickle cell disease.	The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of red blood cell exchange (RBCx) using a Spectra Optia  automated apheresis system in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We used automated RBCx to treat acute and chronic complications in 75 children with SCD who had a median age of 10 years [7-13]. We analyzed 649 RBCx sessions. Peripheral venous access was limited in a number of the children, and thus a femoral double-lumen central venous catheter was required. We recommend heparin locking with 500 units in each lumen of the catheter. To prevent complications, we ensured that all patients had achieved a post-RCE HbS level of < 30%. For chronic transfusion, with a post-RCE Hb level of approximately 10-11 g/dL, a blood exchange volume of >= 32 mL/kg, and an interval between each RBCx procedure of <= 30 days, the residual HbS level was maintained below 30%. For acute transfusion, a post-exchange Hb level >= 10 g/dL (p < 0.001) and a total exchange volume >= 35 mL/kg (p = 0.001) were the best way to reduce HbS to < 30%. AUC was 0.84. Our results show that erythrocytapheresis was useful and safe for children with SCD.
31613565	Hematologic Conditions: Common Hemoglobinopathies.	Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders that lead to abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Genetic mutation results in major changes in the hemoglobin structure, with dysfunctions related to changes in shape, oxygen-carrying capacity, or ability to clump together, causing obstruction of the vascular system. Sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia major are two common hemoglobinopathies worldwide. However, they occur infrequently in the United States, with approximately 101,000 individuals affected. Sickle cell disease phenotypically is exhibited in patients with two hemoglobin S genes but the disease broadly includes many other hemoglobin abnormalities. Complications vary according to genotype and include acute pain crisis, vasoocclusive events, and acute chest syndrome. Blood transfusions are a mainstay of therapy. The two main categories of thalassemias are beta thalassemias and alpha thalassemias. Symptoms range from severe to none. The severity depends on how many genes are affected. Patients with the most severe form of beta thalassemia (ie, two affected genes) are categorized as having thalassemia major or transfusion-dependent disease. The primary treatment for beta thalassemia major currently is transfusions, although stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative option.
30247457	Acupuncture as a Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Pain in a Pediatric Emergency Department.	OBJECTIVES: With epidemic opioid deaths and abuse in the United States, government agencies recommend nonpharmacological treatments for pain. However nonopioid treatment options for moderate to severe pain in the pediatric emergency department (PED) are limited. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using traditional acupuncture (TA) and battlefield acupuncture (BFA) in the treatment of pain in the PED. METHODS: A pediatric cohort treated with acupuncture for pain in an urban PED was assessed. All subjects received TA or BFA as treatment, and pre/postacupuncture pain scores, feedback, and adverse events were assessed. The primary outcome was a change in pain score. RESULTS: Twelve patients received BFA, and 13 received TA for these pain conditions: headaches, sciatica, paraphimosis, torticollis, joint pains (knee, shoulder, jaw), sprains (foot, wrist, thumb), dysmenorrhea, otitis externa, sickle cell, and muscle knot. The mean +- SD pain score change, 5.8 +- 2.5 (P < 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-7.0), was clinically and statistically significant. Over 90% of subjects reported significant improvement or resolution of pain; 96% were satisfied with pain relief and would receive acupuncture again. Two adverse events were noted: one patient reported dizziness, and another, a tinge of blood at 1 of 90 needled points. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that acupuncture is a potential nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for acute pain management in the PED.

31784240	Ex vivo immunological evaluation of stable mixed chimeric patients after matched related donor allogeneic transplantation in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative for sickle cell disease, and the use of matched related donors, non-myeloablative conditioning and sirolimus immunosuppression results in stable mixed chimerism without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the time to terminate sirolimus while maintaining mixed chimerism is unclear. METHODS: In this study, we developed a two-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to evaluate ex vivo immunoreaction in mixed chimeric patients. RESULTS: In co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy controls (without irradiation), we detected proliferation at various ratios of PBMC mixtures (1:9 to 9:1) as well as various concentrations of sirolimus, suggesting that two-way MLR is applicable to patients (having >10% chimerism) undergoing sirolimus treatment. In two-way MLR using PBMCs (including donor and recipient cells) from mixed chimeric patients (n = 28), greater ex vivo proliferation was observed <6 months compared with >6 months post-transplant and healthy control PBMC monoculture. Robust ex vivo proliferation was observed in a patient with acute GVHD, and persistent ex vivo proliferation (until 2 years) was observed in a patient with decreasing donor chimerism. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that in two-way MLR, ex vivo immunoreaction decreases to low levels ~6 months post-transplant. These findings suggest a rationale to continue immunosuppression for 6 months.
38289232	Blood Spotlight Review on Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.	The root cause of sickle cell anemia has been known for seven decades, yet no curative therapies have been available other than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, applicability is limited. Two potentially curative therapies based on gene therapy and gene editing strategies are about to enter the final stages of the FDA approval process. This review surveys the nature of these therapies and the opportunities and issues raised by the prospect of definitive genetically based therapies being available in clinical practice.
31031233	Therapeutic phlebotomy during major sickle cell disease in Togo.	To determine the influence of therapeutic phlebotomy on the reduction of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and of hospital admissions of patients with sickle cell disease and to describe how they experience this practice. Descriptive cross-sectional study of 27 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent phlebotomies. We estimated the number of VOCs, hemoglobin levels, and patient response. Among 27 sickle cell patients (24 SC and 3 SS) who underwent phlebotomies, there were 22 men (81.5 %) men and 5 (18.5 %) women, with an average age of 34.6 +-10.9 years (range: 21-56 years). Before the phlebotomies, 23 (85.2 %) had showed signs of hyperviscosity, they had a mean of 5.3 +- 1.02 (range: 3-8) VOCs annually, and their mean hemoglobin level was 14.3 +-1.5g/dl (range: 10.4 g/dl-16.8 g/dl). The mean number of phlebotomies was 4.9+-4.11 (range: 1-13). After this treatment, 21 (91.3 %) reported that their signs of hyperviscosity disappeared, and the mean number of VOCs annually decreased to 0.9 +-0.07 (range: 0-2). The mean change in hemoglobin was 1.9 +-0.8 g/dl (range: 0.9-3.2 g/dl). Nine patients (6SC and 3SS), 7 under anti-anemic treatment, initially refused phlebotomy, mainly because they did not understand how it could be useful to reduce the amount of blood in patients with a potentially anemic disease. Phlebotomy has resulted in a decrease in the frequency of VOCs and hospitalizations. It is essential to further popularize it and increase patients' aware of its value in combatting sickle cell disease and thus improve their willingness for and adherence to this treatment.
28953104	A Teenager With Sickle Cell Disease and Scalp Swelling.	An intracranial bleed with a midline shift is a potentially life-threatening clinical condition. We present the unusual case of a 13-year-old boy with sickle cell disease who had numerous emergency department visits for a scalp hematoma and was subsequently determined to have subdural and epidural hematomas with midline shift, associated with a skull bone infarction. We review the pathophysiology of this unusual condition and emphasize the importance of including it in the differential diagnosis of any child with sickle cell anemia presenting with a nontraumatic scalp hematoma.
28843636	Management of Sickle Cell Pain Using Pregabalin: A Pilot Study.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) pain may have a neuropathic component. Adjuvant drugs used to treat neuropathic pain have not been studied for the treatment of adults with SCD. To determine the safety and feasibility of using pregabalin for chronic SCD pain. A randomized, controlled, double-blind pilot study. Based on random assignment, participants were treated with pregabalin or placebo control for 3 months with monthly follow-up visits. Participants were recruited from the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System outpatient SCD clinic. Participants/Subjects: A total of 22 participants with SCD (21 African American, 1 other) were included 16 women aged 18-82 (mean age 33.1 +- 9.9). PAINReportIt, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, and Short Form 36 Health Survey were completed. Adverse effects were minimal. Mean scores for average pain intensity, composite pain index, and neuropathic pain revealed a reduction for pregabalin and placebo control groups. Although the between-group differences were not significant, sustained reduction in pain over time within the pregabalin group indicated promising effects of pregabalin for SCD pain. Mean quality-of-life scores increased slightly over time (representing better quality of life) in 7 of 8 domains for the pregabalin group and decreased in 4 of 8 domains for the placebo control group. Small sample size made it difficult to interpret quality-of-life findings. This pilot study provided sufficient evidence that further investigation of pregabalin's potential efficacy for treatment of chronic SCD pain in adults is warranted.
32798305	Outpatient pain clinic and intranasal fentanyl to improve sickle cell disease outcomes.	BACKGROUND: Acute pain events are a leading complication for sickle cell patients. In an attempt to improve pain outcomes, we developed an outpatient pain clinic, and included intranasal fentanyl in the opioid emergency department (ED) pain order set. We evaluated admission rates and opioid administration for patients that attended both the outpatient pain clinic and ED within a 3-month period. METHODS: We recorded the admission rate, IV morphine equivalents, and time from triage for each opioid order and administration from both an outpatient pain clinic and ED visit within a 3-month period for an individual pediatric patient with sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Thirty patients received acute pain management in both settings. We identified a significant reduction in hospital admission when patients received care in the pain clinic as compared to the ED (17% vs 43%, P = .02). Additionally, outpatient pain clinic patients received significantly less IV morphine equivalents than patients received in the ED (5.6 vs 10.6 IV morphine equivalents, P < .0001). In the ED, intranasal fentanyl was administered in a significantly shorter time than patients ordered intravenous opioid (43 vs 75 min, P = .02). The mean time to receiving an opioid in the outpatient pain clinic was 57 min. CONCLUSION: The use of an outpatient pain clinic can reduce admission rates as compared to the ED. The use of intranasal fentanyl reduced the time to first opioid administration in the ED. Patient-centered research or quality improvement projects should continue to focus on novel approaches to acute pain event management.
30636638	The additional genetic diagnosis of homozygous sickle cell disease in a patient with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome: a case report.	BACKGROUND: It is important that multiple genetic diagnoses are not missed. This case report describes the clinical features and management of a patient with co-inheritance of Waardenburg syndrome type 4 or Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, an extremely rare disease, and homozygous sickle cell disease not uncommon in the Caribbean. This case is unusual as it may be the first documented case of the co-inheritance of both these diseases. Given the commonality of sickle cell and related hemoglobinopathies, such combined disorders are likely to be under-reported. Importantly, reporting this case will add to the medical literature as it will raise awareness of the phenotypic manifestations of this disorder. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman had a delayed diagnosis of homozygous sickle cell disease at 7 years of age by hemoglobin electrophoresis. The complications of sickle cell disease she experienced included bone pain, a chronic right leg ulcer, avascular necrosis of her left hip, and symptomatic cholelithiasis. This diagnosis was preceded by an earlier diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome. The basis for the diagnosis of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome was the presence of pigmentary disturbances of her eyes (hypoplastic blue irides), congenital sensorineural hearing loss, and Hirschsprung's disease. She was mute and complained of chronic constipation which required disimpaction on several occasions. She attended a school for the deaf and communicated via writing. A Duhamel procedure bypassing her rectum was performed at age 9. She died following an admission for acute chest syndrome complications. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease can be diagnosed by newborn screening but, as in this case, may have a delayed presentation. The delay in diagnosis of homozygous sickle cell disease illustrates that other genetic disorders should be considered in patients who already have a diagnosis of one Mendelian disorder but show atypical features.
28882446	Relationship between Mixed Donor-Recipient Chimerism and Disease Recurrence after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.	Mixed donor chimerism after hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease (SCD) can result in resolution of disease symptoms, but symptoms recur when donor chimerism is critically low. The relationship between chimerism, hemoglobin S (HbS) level, and symptomatic disease was correlated retrospectively in 95 patients who had chimerism reports available at day 100 and at 1 and 2 years after transplantation. Recurrent disease was defined as recurrence of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, and/or HbS levels > 50%. Thirty-five patients maintained full donor chimerism (myeloid or whole blood) through 2 years. Donor chimerism was less than 10% (defined as graft failure) in 13 patients during this period. Mixed chimerism was reported in the remaining 47 patients (range, 10% to 94%). The lowest documented donor chimerism without symptomatic disease was 26%. Of 12 surviving patients with recurrent disease, 2 had recurrence of symptoms before documented graft failure (donor chimerism of 11% and 17%, respectively). Three patients underwent second transplantation for graft failure. None received donor leukocyte infusion to maintain mixed chimerism or prevent graft failure. We conclude stable donor chimerism greater than 25% is associated with resolution of SCD-related symptoms, and HbS levels in transplant recipients should be interpreted in context of the sickle trait status of the donors.
36701332	Patient-Controlled Analgesia vs Intravenous Push Hydromorphone for Pain Management of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis Associated With Sickle Cell Disease.	Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) appears to be the preferred modality for treatment of pain associated with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and is the current standard of therapy at most institutions. With limited data available, this study analyzed the effectiveness of PCA vs intravenous push (IVP) hydromorphone for pain management of VOC. The primary objective was to determine whether PCA or IVP hydromorphone is more effective in controlling VOC pain determined by a reduction in mean absolute difference pain intensity (MPI) from baseline to discharge. This retrospective single-center study evaluated differences in outcomes between patients treated with PCA vs those treated with IVP hydromorphone for VOC during hospital admission. Those 18 years or older admitted with one of the following International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were included: D57.0 (Hb-SS disease with crisis), D57.2 (sickle cell/Hb-C disease), and D57.4 (sickle cell thalassemia), and administered PCA or IVP hydromorphone. The observed difference in absolute pain scores were not statistically significant (p = 0.753). The use of IVP hydromorphone resulted in a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) and morphine milligram equivalent (MME) use compared to PCA, but was associated with a numerical increase in treatment failures. This study was limited by its retrospective nature, uneven distribution of groups, and only reviewed use of IVP and PCA hydromorphone at one institution.
30514970	Therapeutic strategies for sickle cell disease: towards a multi-agent approach.	For over 100 years, clinicians and scientists have been unravelling the consequences of the A to T substitution in the beta-globin gene that produces haemoglobin S, which leads to the systemic manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD), including vaso-occlusion, anaemia, haemolysis, organ injury and pain. However, despite growing understanding of the mechanisms of haemoglobin S polymerization and its effects on red blood cells, only two therapies for SCD - hydroxyurea and L-glutamine - are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Moreover, these treatment options do not fully address the manifestations of SCD, which arise from a complex network of interdependent pathophysiological processes. In this article, we review efforts to develop new drugs targeting these processes, including agents that reactivate fetal haemoglobin, anti-sickling agents, anti-adhesion agents, modulators of ischaemia-reperfusion and oxidative stress, agents that counteract free haemoglobin and haem, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-thrombotic agents and anti-platelet agents. We also discuss gene therapy, which holds promise of a cure, although its widespread application is currently limited by technical challenges and the expense of treatment. We thus propose that developing systems-oriented multi-agent strategies on the basis of SCD pathophysiology is needed to improve the quality of life and survival of people with SCD.
32881966	Risk factors for osteonecrosis of the femoral head in brain tumor patients receiving corticosteroid after surgery.	PURPOSE: Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a plausible complication in brain tumor patients. Frequent use of corticosteroid therapy, chemotherapy, and oxidative stress for managing brain tumors may be associated with the development of ONFH. However, there is little knowledge on the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH from brain tumor. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH in patients with primary brain tumors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data from consecutive patients between December 2005 and August 2016 from a tertiary university hospital in South Korea. A total of 73 cases of ONFH were identified among 10,674 primary brain tumor patients. After excluding subjects (25 out of 73) with missing data, history of alcohol consumption or smoking, history of femoral bone trauma or surgery, comorbidities such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sickle cell disease, cancer patients other than brain tumor, and previous diagnosis of contralateral ONFH, we performed a 1:2 propensity score-matched, case-control study (ONFH group, 48; control group, 96). Risk factors of ONFH in primary brain tumor were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of ONFH in patients with surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 683.9 per 100,000 persons (73 of 10,674). In this cohort, 55 of 74 patients (74.3%) underwent THA for ONFH treatment. We found that diabetes was an independent factor associated with an increased risk of ONFH in primary brain tumor patients (OR = 7.201, 95% CI, 1.349-38.453, p = 0.021). There was a significant difference in univariate analysis, including panhypopituitarism (OR = 4.394, 95% CI, 1.794-11.008, p = 0.002), supratentorial location of brain tumor (OR = 2.616, 95% CI, 1.245-5.499, p = 0.011), and chemotherapy (OR = 2.867, 95% CI, 1.018-8.069, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of ONFH after surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 0.68%. Diabetes was an independent risk factor for developing ONFH, whereas corticosteroid dose was not. Routine screening for brain tumor-associated ONFH is not recommended; however, a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients at risk may allow for early intervention and preservation of the joints.
34115136	Leukemia after gene therapy for sickle cell disease: insertional mutagenesis, busulfan, both, or neither.	Recently, encouraging data provided long-awaited hope for gene therapy as a cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Nevertheless, the transient suspension of the bluebird bio gene therapy trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02140554) after participants developed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) raised concerns. Potential possibilities for these cases include busulfan, insertional mutagenesis, both, or neither. Busulfan was considered the cause in the first reported case because the transgene was not present in the AML/MDS. However, busulfan is unlikely to have contributed to the most recent case. The transgene was present in the patient's malignant cells, indicating they were infused after busulfan treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative explanation for events in the bluebird bio trial, including that SCD population studies show an increased relative, but a low absolute, risk of AML/MDS. We propose a new hypothesis: after gene therapy for SCD, the stress of switching from homeostatic to regenerative hematopoiesis by transplanted cells drives clonal expansion and leukemogenic transformation of preexisting premalignant clones, eventually resulting in AML/MDS. Evidence validating our hypothesis will support prescreening individuals with SCD for preleukemic progenitors before gene therapy. While presumed viable, safe strategy has been implemented to resume gene therapy in adults with severe SCD, reasonable alternative curative therapy should be considered for children and adults with severe SCD. Currently, open multicenter clinical trials are incorporating nonmyeloablative conditioning, related haploidentical donors, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. Preliminary results from these trials appear promising, and National Institutes of Health-sponsored trials are ongoing in individuals with SCD using this platform.
28065838	Current Results and Future Research Priorities in Late Effects after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Children with Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia: A Consensus Statement from the Second Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium International Conference on Late Effects after Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	Sustained donor engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) converts to healthy donor hemoglobin synthesis and halts disease symptoms in patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia major. A disease-free survival probability that exceeds 90% has been reported when HCT using an HLA-matched sibling donor is performed in young patients with low-risk disease or treatment-related risk factors. Alternate donor HCT and HCT in adults is performed infrequently because of a higher risk profile. Transplant-specific risks include conditioning regimen-related toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection with marrow aplasia or disease recurrence, and infections associated with immunosuppression and delayed immune reconstitution. The magnitude of risk depends on patient age, clinical status of the underlying disease (eg, organ injury from vasculopathy and iron overload), donor source, and intensity of the conditioning regimen. These risks are commonly monitored and reported in the short term. Documenting very late outcomes is important, but these data are rarely reported because of challenges imposed by patient drop-out and insufficient resources. This report summarizes long-term follow-up results after HCT for hemoglobin disorders, identifies gaps in knowledge, and discusses opportunities for future investigations. This consensus summary will be followed by a second article detailing comprehensive long-term follow-up recommendations to aid in maintaining health in these individuals and identifying late complication risks that could facilitate interventions to improve outcomes.
33724440	Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.
33792218	Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Red cell transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease with an emphasis on alloimmunization.
32951731	Randomized phase 2 trial of Intravenous Gamma Globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from the midpoint analysis.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic hemolytic disorder associated with frequent pain episodes, end organ damage and a shortened lifespan. Currently there exist no disease specific targeted therapies for the treatment of acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and management with analgesics and hydration is purely supportive. Improvement in understanding of disease pathophysiology has resulted in a great interest in disease modifying novel therapies and many are being evaluated in clinical trials. Here we report the results from the pre-specified mid-point analysis of the Phase 2 study of Intravenous Gamma Globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of acute VOC in patients with SCD and lessons learned.
38066847	Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion perspective.	Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.
34160085	Process and procedural adjustments to improve CD34+ collection efficiency of hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Adequate CD34+ collection efficiency (CE) is critical to achieve target CD34+ cell doses in hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) collections. Autologous HPC collection in sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with unstable collection interfaces and low CD34+ CEs. We hypothesized that variables specific to SCD, activation of blood cells and elevated viscosity, might contribute to these issues and made adjustments to the collection process and procedure to address our hypothesis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In two patients with SCD undergoing autologous HPC collection on our clinical trial (NCT02193191), we therefore implemented adjustments to the process and procedure in the following areas: proximity of RBC exchange to HPC collection, the type of anticoagulation, and the packing factor setting. RESULTS: There was no collection interface instability. Our CD34+ CE1s were high at 70% and 51%, and granulocyte CE, platelet CE, and product granulocyte % were remarkably low. Product hematocrits were not as high as previously reported to be required to obtain adequate CEs. Interestingly, one HPC product showed a hemoglobin S (HbS) of 91% at the same time that the peripheral blood (PB) showed a HbS of 22%. DISCUSSION: Adjustments to the HPC collection process and procedure were associated with adequate CD34+ CEs and low granulocyte and platelet contamination in HPC products from SCD patients. Given the discrepancy in the percentage of sickle RBCs in the product versus the PB, we hypothesize that CD34+ cells and RBCs may aggregate. Our interventions and hypothesis should be further investigated in larger studies.
30122266	Impact of Red Blood Cell Antigen Matching on Alloimmunization and Transfusion Complications in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.	Red blood cells (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, it is complicated by RBC alloimmunization, iron overload, transfusion reactions and infection. Several reports documented an increased incidence of alloantibodies in transfused individuals with SCD, especially for Rh and Kell antigens. As a result, the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel and British Society for Haematology guidelines recommend primary matching for C/c, E/e and K antigens in addition to ABO/RhD for RBC transfusions. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations was cited as limited and understanding of alloimmunization in SCD is evolving. To examine the limitations of the evidence, we undertook a systematic review of evidence behind recommendations for limited and extended serologic and genotypic RBC antigen matching to reduce alloimmunization, autoimmunization and transfusion reactions. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases using MeSH index and free text terms between 1976 through October 2015 and papers and captured through July 2016 through review references in papers, word of mouth, and ongoing Google Scholar and Medline Alerts identified 303 unique articles. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were classified by the Oxford Centre Evidence Based levels of evidence. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were completed for 18 of the 19 studies. There were no prospective randomized controlled trials. Sixteen of the articles were cohort studies, two were cross-sectional studies, and one decision tree model examining costs. Low-quality evidence from observational cohort studies supports that alloimmunization prevalence can be decreased by extending serological RBC antigen matching. Transfusion reactions are generally poorly and inconsistently reported. There was no evidence reporting the effect prophylactic genotypic matching has on alloimmunization, autoimmunization or transfusion reactions. There were no studies comparing prophylactic genotypic matching to serologic matching. High-quality evidence was lacking to support clinical decision making regarding best transfusion practices. Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to determine best strategies for reducing the rate of alloimmunization using serologic and genotypic matching.
31385330	Metabolic impact of red blood cell exchange with rejuvenated red blood cells in sickle cell patients.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange (RCE) transfusions are a mainstay in the treatment of sickle cell anemia (SCA), and allow a temporary restoration of physiological parameters with respect to erythrocyte oxygen carrying capacity and systems metabolism. Recently, we noted that 1) RCE significantly impacts recipients' metabolism in SCA; 2) fresh and end-of-storage red blood cell (RBC) units differently impact systems of metabolism in healthy autologous recipients; and 3) phosphate/inosine/pyruvate/adenine (PIPA) solution reverses the metabolic age of stored RBCs. Therefore, we hypothesized that RCE with PIPA-treated RBC units could further increase the metabolic benefits of RCE in SCA patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating plasma and erythrocytes were collected from patients with SCA before and after RCE, with either conventional or PIPA-treated RBC units, prior to metabolomics analyses. RESULTS: Consistent with prior work, RCE significantly decreased circulating levels of markers of systemic hypoxemia (lactate, succinate) and decreased plasma levels of acyl-carnitines and amino acids. However, PIPA-treated exchanges were superior to untreated RCEs, with a higher energy state and an increased capacity to activate the pentose phosphate pathway and glutamine metabolism. In addition, RBCs and plasma from recipients of PIPA-treated RBC units resulted in significantly decreased levels of post-transfusion plasticizers, though at the expense of higher circulating levels of oxidized purines (hypoxanthine, xanthine, and the antioxidant urate). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of PIPA-treated RBCs further increases the metabolic benefits of RCE to patients with SCA, significantly reducing the levels of post-transfusion plasticizers.
32147028	Acupuncture for pediatric sickle cell pain management: A promising non-opioid therapy.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of acupuncture for pain management in children with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of a single-institution experience on the use of acupuncture in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease was evaluated between 2012-2019. Demographic characteristics, presenting pain location, pain scores pre- and post-acupuncture, and adverse events were collected. SETTING: Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital Pediatric Hematology outpatient and inpatient units. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture was performed by six licensed acupuncturists. Point prescriptions were based on pain location, philosophies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Japanese Style of Kiiko Matsumoto acupuncture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain reduction as measured by two Verbal Pain Scales. RESULTS: Ninety acupuncture treatments were administered to twenty-four patients with sickle cell disease: median age 17.5 years, 62 % female, 37.5 % African American, 50 % Hispanic. The mean treatment duration was 18.5 +- 4.8 min. Fifty-five treatments had documented pre/post-acupuncture pain scores. Pain reduction was achieved in 65.5 % of these treatments. A 0-10 pain scale used in 13 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture score of 7.31 +- 1.75, post-acupuncture score of 6.08 +- 1.85, and a mean pain score change of 1.23 +- 1.09 (p = 0.11); A 0-4 pain scale used in 42 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture pain score of 3.31 +- 0.72, post-acupuncture score of 2.33 +- 0.98, and a mean pain score change of 0.98 +- 0.99 (p < 0.0001). No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy decreased pain for our patients with sickle cell disease, providing a safe non-opioid therapeutic option.
34889368	Hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: updates and future directions.	Excellent outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA-identical siblings, improvements in conditioning regimens, novel graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and the availability of alternative donors have all contributed to the increased applicability and acceptability of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). In young children with symptomatic SCD with an available HLA-identical related donor, HCT should be carefully considered. HCT from alternative donors is typically undertaken only in patients with severe symptoms, causing or likely to cause organ damage, and in the context of clinical trials. Patients undergoing HCT for SCD require careful counseling and preparation. They require careful monitoring of unique organ toxicities and complications during HCT. Patients must be prospectively followed for a prolonged time to determine the long-term outcomes and late effects of HCT for SCD. Thus, there is a need for a universal, longitudinal clinical registry to follow patients after HCT for SCD in conjunction with individuals who do not receive HCT to compare outcomes. Antibody-based conditioning and ex-vivo umbilical cord blood expansion are likely to improve the availability and acceptability of HCT. In addition, new disease-modifying drugs and the emerging option of the autologous transplantation of gene-modified hematopoietic progenitor cells are likely to expand the available therapeutic options and make decision-making by patients, physicians, and caregivers even more complicated. Future efforts must also focus on determining the impact of socioeconomic status on access to and outcomes of HCT and the long-term impact of HCT on patients, families, and society.
30910617	Red blood cell exchange techniques and methods.	Red blood cell exchange (RBCX) has become a standard therapy to remove abnormal red blood cells (RBC) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In the last few decades, RBCX techniques have gradually improved, allowing sickle RBCs to be removed with greater precision and enabling specific hematological targets to be set. Improved knowledge of the techniques as well as the clinical and biological targets has led to optimization of the procedures. The aim of this review is to summarize the current technique, methods, targets and schedules of RBCX and to consider the outstanding issues that require additional investigation.
29797658	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: Progress and challenges.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) presents challenges to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), including donor availability and morbidity with age/disease severity. However, severe SCD causes irreversible organ damage that HSCT can mitigate. This benefit must be balanced against preparative regimen toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and mortality risk. We review efforts to balance HSCT complications with the promise of cure, and knowledge gaps that warrant further investigation. We highlight the burden of SCD, HSCT risks and benefits, and SCD families' approach to this balance. We emphasize the necessity for information exchange to ensure a joint decision-making process between providers and patients.
31679762	Examining the Role of Complement in Predicting, Preventing, and Treating Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a critical component of optimal management for a broad range of conditions. Regardless of the indication, pretransfusion testing is required to appropriately match RBC donors and recipients to provide immunologically compatible blood. Although this approach is effective in the vast majority of situations, occasionally, patients will inadvertently receive an incompatible RBC transfusion, which can result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR). In addition, patients with life-threatening anemia and a complex alloantibody profile, which precludes rapid procurement of compatible RBCs, may also receive incompatible RBCs, placing them at risk for an HTR. Despite the rarity of these clinical situations, when incompatible blood transfusion results in an HTR, the consequences can be devastating. In this review, we will explore the challenges associated with actively preventing and treating acute HTRs following incompatible RBC transfusion. In doing so, we will focus primarily on the role of complement, not only as a key player in HTRs, but also as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of HTRs.
33247605	Positive effects of ultrasound-guided peripheral IV insertion on pediatric sickle cell anemia/thalassemia patients receiving automated red cell exchange procedures or chronic transfusion therapy.	BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular access and venipuncture are major causes of distress and anxiety for children and their parents. This is especially difficult for patients with hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia major and sickle cell disease) who require chronic blood transfusions. These patients require peripheral venous access for regular blood transfusions and (in the case of sickle cell disease) for automated red cell exchange procedures. Peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters are much preferred to central venous lines as they carry far fewer risks. However, when patients experience multiple unsuccessful attempts to initiate a PIV, it can be traumatizing and cause anxiety for future visits. Establishing therapeutic trust and ensuring a smooth experience are of paramount importance for these chronic patients who require regular blood transfusions. AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine whether ultrasound-guided PIV insertion decreases PIV-associated pain and anxiety, and whether the number of attempts and amount of time spent accessing PIVs in children with difficult peripheral intravenous (DPIV) access is reduced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a pilot study with both retrospective and prospective components. Hemoglobinopathies are relatively rare in our population and our study cohort was small (N = 18). RESULTS: We identified four DPIV access patients. We recorded each time these patients had a PIV inserted as an encounter. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We found that while there was a small amount of time gained by using ultrasound-guided PIV insertion, patient and parent satisfaction was significantly improved.

35075288	Long-term outcomes of lentiviral gene therapy for the beta-hemoglobinopathies: the HGB-205 trial.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) are the most prevalent monogenic disorders worldwide. Trial HGB-205 ( NCT02151526 ) aimed at evaluating gene therapy by autologous CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vector BB305 that encodes the anti-sickling betaA-T87Q-globin expressed in the erythroid lineage. HGB-205 is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized interventional study of 2-year duration at a single center, followed by observation in long-term follow-up studies LTF-303 ( NCT02633943 ) and LTF-307 ( NCT04628585 ) for TDT and SCD, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those for allogeneic transplantation but restricted to patients lacking geno-identical, histocompatible donors. Four patients with TDT and three patients with SCD, ages 13-21 years, were treated after busulfan myeloablation 4.6-7.9 years ago, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Key primary endpoints included mortality, engraftment, replication-competent lentivirus and clonal dominance. No adverse events related to the drug product were observed. Clinical remission and remediation of biological hallmarks of the disease have been sustained in two of the three patients with SCD, and frequency of transfusions was reduced in the third. The patients with TDT are all transfusion free with improvement of dyserythropoiesis and iron overload.
31803937	Treatment for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent and severe complication of sickle cell disease and its treatment is not standardised. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of any surgical procedure compared with other surgical interventions or non-surgical procedures, on avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease in terms of efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from both ongoing trial registries and the reference lists of papers identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials comparing specific therapies for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Given only one trial was identified, meta-analyses were not possible. MAIN RESULTS: One trial (46 participants) was eligible for inclusion. After randomization eight participants were withdrawn, mainly because they declined to participate in the trial. Data were analysed for 38 participants at the end of the trial. After a mean follow-up of three years, hip core decompression and physical therapy did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone using the score from the original trial (an improvement of 18.1 points for those treated with intervention therapy versus an improvement of 15.7 points with control therapy). We are very uncertain whether there is any difference between groups regarding major complications (hip pain, risk ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.60; vaso-occlusive crises, risk ratio 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.80; very low quality of evidence); and acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.56; very low quality of evidence)). This trial did not report results on mortality or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that adding hip core decompression to physical therapy achieves clinical improvement in people with sickle cell disease with avascular necrosis of bone compared to physical therapy alone. However, we highlight that our conclusion is based on one trial with high attrition rates. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the role of hip-core depression for this clinical condition. Endpoints should focus on participants' subjective experience (e.g. quality of life and pain) as well as more objective 'time-to-event' measures (e.g. mortality, survival, hip longevity). The availability of participants to allow adequate trial power will be a key consideration for endpoint choice.
28853040	State of the Art Management of Acute Vaso-occlusive Pain in Sickle Cell Disease.	Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Multiple complex pathophysiological processes can result in pain during a VOC. Despite significant improvements in the understanding and management of SCD, little progress has been made in the management of pain in SCD, although new treatments are being explored. Opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the mainstay of treatment of VOC pain, but new classes of drugs are being tested to prevent and treat acute pain. Advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and pain and the pharmacogenomics of opioids have yet to be effectively utilized in the management of VOC. Opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia are significant problems associated with the long-term use of opioids, and better strategies for chronic pain therapy are needed. This report reviews the mechanisms of pain associated with acute VOC, describes the current management of VOC, and describes some of the new therapies under evaluation for the management of acute VOC in SCD.
28733096	Brachial vein transposition is a promising ultimate upper limb autologous arteriovenous angioaccess despite its many pitfalls.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the possibility of using the brachial veins despite their deep location, small caliber, and thin wall. METHODS: There were 64 patients without superficial veins who were eligible for two-stage brachial vein transposition (BrVT); 54 patients were on hemodialysis, 9 patients had sickle cell disease, and 1 patient had long-term parenteral nutrition. Preoperative imaging was performed with color duplex ultrasound as well as venography for suspected central vein stenosis. A surgical microscope was used to create an end-to-side anastomosis between the brachial vein (medial, if possible) and artery. No minimum vein diameter was required. Postoperative color duplex ultrasound imaging was scheduled at 1 month. Second-stage superficialization was performed 2 to 3 months later with tunnelization and a new arteriovenous anastomosis. RESULTS: For the 64 patients, cumulative primary patency rates (+- standard deviation [SD]) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years were 50% (+-7%), 42% (+-7%), 37% (+-8%), and 27% (+-11%), respectively. Primary assisted patency rates (+-SD) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years were 60% (+-6%), 51% (+-7%), 45% (+-7%), and 37% (+-9%), respectively. Secondary patency rates (+-SD) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years were 60% (+-6%), 53% (+-7%), 53% (+-7%), and 45% (+-8%), respectively. Early complications included thrombosis, nonmaturation, and upper arm edema. At the second stage (n = 50), four patients presented with unexplained major fibrosis extending cephalad from the first surgical site and preventing any dissection of the vein. Four patients had more usual complications (one nonmaturation, two occlusions of the brachial vein at the previous arteriovenous graft-vein anastomosis), and two were lost to follow-up. Vein transposition in a subcutaneous tunnel was technically unfeasible in eight patients. Of the 64 patients, 40 (62%) had a functional BrVT that was cannulated for effective dialysis after a median interval of 72 days (15-420 days) from the first stage. Mean cumulative secondary patency rates (from first cannulation) at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 91% +- 5%, 72% +- 8%, and 62% +- 10%, respectively. Overall, 13 patients were lost to follow-up. Secondary complications were low flow and central vein occlusion. Long-term complications were related to stenosis and thrombosis, aneurysms, and puncture site necrosis. Median follow-up from the first stage was 1.62 years (0.02-11.3 years). CONCLUSIONS: Despite many pitfalls for the surgeon, BrVT offers promising long-term patency.
32034776	Curative options for sickle cell disease: haploidentical stem cell transplantation or gene therapy?	Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the lack of available matched donors makes this therapy out of reach for the majority of patients with SCD. Alternative donor sources such as haploidentical HSCT expand the donor pool to nearly all patients with SCD, with recent data showing high overall survival, limited toxicities, and effective reduction in acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Simultaneously, multiple gene therapy strategies are entering clinical trials with preliminary data showing their success, theoretically offering all patients yet another curative strategy without the morbidity and mortality of GVHD. As improvements are made for alternative donors in the allogeneic setting and as data emerge from gene therapy trials, the optimal curative strategy for any individual patient with SCD will be determined by many critical factors including efficacy, transplant morbidity and mortality, safety, patient disease status and preference, cost and applicability. Haploidentical may be the preferred choice now based mostly on availability of data; however, gene therapy is closing the gap and may ultimately prove to be the better option. Progress in both strategies, however, makes cure more attainable for the individual with SCD.
32815878	Physical Therapy in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: Assessing Potential Benefits and Barriers.	BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in pediatric and young adult patients, pain remains a significant cause of disease-related morbidity. Physical therapy has been shown to be useful for the treatment of pain in young patients with chronic illnesses, however, limited data exists regarding potential benefits of physical therapy in patients with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of health care providers and support staff in the New England area to identify potential benefits of and barriers to outpatient physical therapy in this patient population. RESULTS: Nearly 92% of survey participants felt that physical therapy had the potential to be beneficial in pediatric and young adult patients with SCD. A majority of physicians reported having referred patients with SCD for physical therapy. Perceived potential benefits included improved functional mobility, improved chronic pain symptoms, decreased opiate use, improved mood symptoms, improved acute pain symptoms, and improved adherence with medications and clinic visits. Significant perceived barriers identified included lack of transportation, time constraints, patient lack of understanding, and difficulty with insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers have a positive view of the use of physical therapy in the management of this patient population. Significant barriers exist which need to be addressed.
30305330	Chronic blood exchange transfusions in the management of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension complicating sickle cell disease.	The long-term effects of chronic blood exchange transfusions (BETs) on pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension complicating sickle cell disease (SCD) are unknown.13 homozygous SS SCD patients suffering from pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension and treated by chronic BETs were evaluated retrospectively. Assessments included haemodynamics, New York Heart Association Functional Class (NYHA FC), 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and blood tests.Before initiating BETs, all patients were NYHA FC III or IV, median (range) 6MWD was 223 (0-501) m and median (range) pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 3.7 (2-12.5) Wood Units. After a median number of 4 BET sessions, all patients had improved to NYHA FC II or III. Significant improvements in haemodynamics were observed, including a decrease in PVR (p=0.01). There was a trend to higher 6MWD (p=0.09). Median (range) follow-up time after initiation of BETs was 25 (6-53) months. During this period, two patients decided to stop BETs. One of them died from acute right heart failure and the other experienced worsening pulmonary hypertension. Two other patients died during follow-up at 25 and 54 months after BET initiation.Chronic BETs may be a potential therapeutic option in pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension complicating SCD, leading to significant clinical and haemodynamic improvements. These data must be confirmed in a prospective study.
32301178	The vaso-occlusive pain crisis in sickle cell disease: Definition, pathophysiology, and management.	Early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are critical to the management of patients with sickle cell disease. It is essential to differentiate between VOC-associated pain and chronic pain, hyperalgesia, neuropathy, and neuropathic pain. The pathophysiology of VOCs includes polymerization of abnormal sickle hemoglobin, inflammation, and adhesion. Hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for reducing the frequency of VOCs; the European Medicines Agency has approved only hydroxyurea. Other novel treatments are in late-stage clinical development in both the United States and the European Union. The development of agents for prevention and treatment of VOCs should be driven by our understanding of its pathophysiology.
30916794	Normal saline bolus use in pediatric emergency departments is associated with poorer pain control in children with sickle cell anemia and vaso-occlusive pain.	Vaso-occlusive pain events (VOE) are the leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits in sickle cell anemia (SCA). This study assessed the variability in use of intravenous fluids (IVFs), and the association of normal saline bolus (NSB), on pain and other clinical outcomes in children with SCA, presenting to pediatric emergency departments (PED) with VOE. Four-hundred charts of children age 3-21 years with SCA/VOE receiving parenteral opioids at 20 high-volume PEDs were evaluated in a retrospective study. Data on type and amount of IVFs used were collected. Patients were divided into two groups: those who received NSB and those who did not. The association of NSB use on change in pain scores and admission rates was evaluated. Among 400 children studied, 261 (65%) received a NSB. Mean age was 13.8 +- 4.9 years; 46% were male; 92% had hemoglobin-SS. The IVFs (bolus and/or maintenance) were used in 84% of patients. Eight different types of IVFs were utilized and IVF volume administered varied widely. Mean triage pain scores were similar between groups, but improvement in pain scores from presentation-to-ED-disposition was smaller in the NSB group (2.2 vs 3.0, P = .03), while admission rates were higher (71% vs 59%, P = .01). Use of NSB remained associated with poorer final pain scores and worse change in pain scores in our multivariable model. In conclusion, wide variations in practice utilizing IVFs are common. NSB is given to >50% of children with SCA/VOE, but is associated with poorer pain control; a controlled prospective trial is needed to determine causality.

38019672	Sirolimus-induced Hypertriglyceridemia Leads to Acute Pancreatitis and Diabetic Ketoacidosis Post Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) is a potent immunosuppressive agent, used in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for Graft vs Host disease prophylaxis. Compared to calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus has no neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, but sirolimus causes dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, delayed wound healing, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Here we report a case of acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with sickle cell disease post haploidentical family donor HSCT which was managed conservatively without plasmapheresis. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first reported case of developing acute pancreatitis as an adverse effect of sirolimus-induced hypertriglyceridemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis in a recipient of HSCT.
38770886	The hope, hype and obstacles surrounding cell therapy.	Cell therapy offers hope, but it also presents challenges, most particularly the limited ability of human organs and tissues to regenerate. Since many diseases are associated with irreversible pathophysiological or traumatic changes, stem cells and their derivatives are unable to secure healing. Although regenerative medicine offers chances for improvements in many diseases, such as type one diabetes and Parkinson's disease, it cannot eliminate the primary cause of many of them. While successes can be expected for diseases such as sickle cell disease, this is not the case for hereditary diseases with varied mutation types or for ciliopathies, which start in embryogenesis. In this complicated medical environment, synthetic biology offers some solutions, but their implementation will take many years. Still, positive examples such as CAR-T therapy offer hope.
36994864	Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain in children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) leading to hospitalization, psychological sequelae and a decreased health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing sickle cell related pain in children with SCD. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive literature search up until October 2022 was performed to identify studies that investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on (1) pain frequency and/or intensity, and (2) analgesic and health service use in children with SCD until the age of 21. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designed (QED) studies were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten articles (five RCTs and five QED studies) with 422 participants were included. They investigated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 5), biofeedback (n = 2), massage (n = 1), virtual reality (n = 1) and yoga (n = 1). The majority of the interventions were psychological (n = 7) and were performed in the outpatient clinic (n = 6). CBT and biofeedback significantly reduced frequency and/or intensity of SCD-related pain in outpatient settings, while virtual reality and yoga significantly reduced pain in inpatient settings. Biofeedback also significantly reduced analgesic use. None of the included articles reported reduced health service use. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions may be effective in reducing pain in paediatric patients with SCD. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies a quantitative analysis could not be performed. Awaiting further supporting evidence, healthcare providers should consider implementing these interventions as valuable part of a comprehensive pain management strategy plan.
29656137	Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Demonstrates Stable Engraftment in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.	We report on the screening and development of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adult patients with clinically aggressive sickle cell disease (SCD) at our institution. Of 50 adult SCD patients referred for HSCT between January 2014 and March 2017, 20% were denied by insurance. Of 41 patients initially screened, 10% lacked an available haploidentical donor, 29% had elevated donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), and 34% declined to proceed to HSCT. All 10 patients who were transplanted received peripheral blood stem cells. The initial 2 were conditioned with alemtuzumab/total body irradiation (TBI) 3 Gy followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide and failed to engraft. The next 8 patients received the regimen developed at Johns Hopkins University with TBI 3 Gy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered from day +12 in those with HbS < 30%. All 8 patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil >.5 x 109/L of 22 days (range, 18 to 23). One patient subsequently lost the graft, and 7 (87.5%) maintained >95% donor cell chimerism at 1-year post-HSCT. Two patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of at least grade II. One had chronic GVHD and died >1 year after HSCT of unknown causes. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11 to 29), 7 patients (87.5%) are alive. Our findings suggest that limited insurance coverage, high rate of DSAs, and patient declining HSCT may limit the availability of haploidentical HSCT in adult SCD patients. The modified Hopkins regimen used here demonstrates high engraftment and low morbidity rates and should be tested in larger, multicenter, prospective clinical trials.
34487059	The Effects of Treatment with Blood Transfusion, Iron Chelation and Hydroxyurea on Puberty, Growth and Spermatogenesis in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): A short update.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is traditionally associated with growth failure and delayed puberty. Wasting and stunting are still prevalent in children and adolescents with SCD, especially in developing countries. In addition, sperm abnormalities are frequent in males with SCD, with high rates of low sperm density, low sperm counts, poor motility, and increased abnormal morphology.  Severe anemia, vaso-occlusive attacks with ischemic injury to different organs including the pituitary gland and testis, and nutritional factors are incriminated in the pathogenesis of defective growth, puberty, and spermatogenesis. There is great phenotypic variability among patients with SCD. The variability in the clinical severity of SCA can partly be explained by genetic modifiers, including HbF level and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. In the past, severe disease led to early mortality. Advancements in treatment have allowed patients with SCD to have a longer and better quality of life. For most patients, the mainstays of treatment are preventive and supportive. For those with severe SCD, three major therapeutic options are currently available: erythrocyte transfusion or exchange, hydroxyurea, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this mini-review, the authors tried to recognize, delineate, and update knowledge on abnormalities due to SCD from those created by the use of different treatment modalities.
31490318	Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Discussing the currently available HSCT options for Hb SS patients highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each modality in the light of recently published data. RECENT FINDINGS: When MSD is available, myeloablative regimen is the preferred approach for otherwise healthy children whereas the nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimen is of choice for adults as well as children with SCD-associated morbidities. Mixed chimerism is common especially with NMA conditioning and is usually enough for cure. Alternative donor HSCT outcomes are progressively improving especially with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis. SUMMARY: Recent studies comparing HSCT and chronic transfusion in Hb SS patients increasingly come in favor of HSCT arm. Advances in HSCT field led to donor pool expansion and better tolerated regimens. It is easier now to tailor a personalized transplantation plan for almost every patient. A successful management plan should be sufficiently comprehensive addressing patients' and families' social and psychological concerns to ensure compliance and improve outcome.
36964626	Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): statistical and qualitative analysis plan for a randomised controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: There are significant knowledge gaps regarding the effectiveness of serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) for pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). The protocol for the randomised feasibility trial assessing SPEBT versus usual care in women with SCD (TAPS2 trial) has previously been published. This publication outlines the statistical and qualitative analysis plan for the study. METHODS AND DESIGN: TAPS2 is a randomised two-arm phase 2 feasibility trial with a nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Up to 50 pregnant women with SCD and a singleton pregnancy will be recruited and individually randomised to either SPEBT approximately every 6-10 weeks until delivery (intervention arm) or to usual care (control arm). Information will be collected on a range of feasibility and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Due to the impact of COVID-19 on study recruitment, the initial study period of 24 months was extended to 48 months. Other protocol updates designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19-related disruption included allowing for remote consent and conducting all qualitative interviews by telephone. The primary outcome for the trial is the overall recruitment rate. The number of women screened, eligible, consented, randomised and withdrawn will be summarised as a CONSORT flow diagram. Differences in clinical outcomes will additionally be presented as an initial assessment of efficacy and to inform sample size calculations for a future definitive trial. Qualitative interviews with trial participants and clinicians will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis; data from interviews with participants who declined to participate in the trial will be extracted and incorporated into summary tables to report key findings. The health economic analysis plan is not covered by this update. CONCLUSION: The publication of this analysis plan is designed to aid transparency and to reduce the potential for reporting bias.

34535465	HbA1c performs well in monitoring glucose control even in populations with high prevalence of medical conditions that may alter its reliability: the OPTIMAL observational multicenter study.	INTRODUCTION: The utility of HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) to estimate glycemic control in populations of African and other low-resource countries has been questioned because of high prevalence of other medical conditions that may affect its reliability. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we aimed to determine the comparative performance of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (within 5 hours of a meal) and random non-fasting glucose (RPG) in assessing glycemic burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the performance of HbA1c, FPG and RPG in comparison to CGM mean glucose in 192 Ugandan participants with type 2 diabetes. Analysis was undertaken in all participants, and in subgroups with and without medical conditions reported to affect HbA1c reliability. We then assessed the performance of FPG and RPG, and optimal thresholds, in comparison to HbA1c in participants without medical conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability. RESULTS: 32.8% (63/192) of participants had medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability: anemia 9.4% (18/192), sickle cell trait and/or hemoglobin C (HbC) 22.4% (43/192), or renal impairment 6.3% (12/192). Despite high prevalence of medical conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, HbA1c had the strongest correlation with CGM measured glucose in day-to-day living (0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), followed by FPG (0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86) and RPG (0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). Among participants without conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, FPG and RPG had a similar diagnostic performance in identifying poor glycemic control defined by a range of HbA1c thresholds. FPG of >=7.1 mmol/L and RPG of >=10.5 mmol/L correctly identified 78.2% and 78.8%, respectively, of patients with an HbA1c of >=7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is the optimal test for monitoring glucose control even in low-income and middle-income countries where medical conditions that may alter its reliability are prevalent; FPG and RPG are valuable alternatives where HbA1c is not available.
38069073	Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.	The design of clinical protocols and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in all diseases including for millions of patients affected by excess iron deposition (EID) toxicity based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations and limitations. EID is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused patients. Differences in iron chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in neurodegenerative diseases at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in thalassemia major (TM) when using higher doses. In particular, the transformation of TM from a fatal to a chronic disease has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased mortality in TM. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology resulted in the complete elimination of EID and the maintenance of normal iron store levels in TM. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored by MRI T2* diagnosis for EID levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded patients with sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, or non-iron-loaded categories with EID in different organs could also benefit from such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug toxicity in some patients and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals, drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in TM and other iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general iron toxicity.
38049241	Les anemies aigues et la strategie transfusionnelle chez les drepanocytaires adultes: Acute anemias transfusion strategy in adult sickle cell patients.	Worsening of anemia is very common in sickle cell disease. It is important to investigate specific complications related to sickle cell disease but also other causes of anemia in general. Transfusions or exchange transfusions are major therapeutic options and are frequently used for acute complications of sickle cell disease but also for primary and secondary prevention of some of the chronic complications. The transfusion strategy has been modified since the awareness of post-transfusion hemolysis by taking into account the transfusion risk score. A strong collaboration between the patient's expert center, the Blood center and the patient's hospitalization unit is required to make decisions.   2023 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

32360095	ABO blood group should be considered and reported when red blood cell exchange transfusion is used to treat Plasmodiumfalciparum Malaria patients.	"Laboratory and epidemiologic studies have clarified how persons born with malaria-resistant red blood cells (RBCs)-like group-O, sickle-trait, and C-trait RBCs-are protected against death or severe disease due to Plasmodiumfalciparum (Pf) infection. Compared to malaria-promoting RBCs-like non-O or hemoglobin-AA RBCs-inborn RBC protection against severe Pf malaria can be profound: up to 10-fold greater. Given that ""the Berlin patient"" success showed patients do not have to be born with disease-resistant cells to benefit from them, why have the biologically plausible benefits of exchange transfusion (ET) of malaria-resistant RBCs not yet been evaluated? Unfortunately, a 2013 ET-for-malaria meta-analysis could not quantify the impact on mortality of ET of malaria-resistant RBCs because RBC malaria resistance variables (ABO group, hemoglobin type, enzyme levels, etc.) had not been reported in any of the ET studies used in that meta-analysis. To promote evaluation of the therapeutic impact of specific malaria-resistant RBCs, we urge clinicians to always report ABO blood group (and all other RBC malaria-resistance variables they are aware of) when they use ET to rescue Pf-infected patients. Prudent selection of donor RBCs has successfully optimized ET for sickle cell disease patients, and this precedent suggests selection of special malaria-resistant donor RBCs may optimize ET for Pf-malaria patients. Given that ET is used worldwide as a rescue adjunct, we feel it is most prudent to now assume-until proven otherwise-that considering and reporting the Pf-malaria-resistance variables of the RBCs to be transfused-at least ABO status-will help optimize ET-for-malaria."
29788942	Use of autologous bone marrow stem cell implantation for osteonecrosis of the knee in sickle cell disease: a preliminary report.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to evaluate safety, feasibility and clinical results of bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMC) implantation for early-stage osteonecrosis of the knee (OK) secondary to sickle cell disease. METHODS: Thirty-three SCD patients (45 knees) with OK treated with BMC implantation in the osteonecrotic lesion were clinically and functionally evaluated through the American Knee Society Clinical Score (KSS), Knee Functional Score (KFS) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score. MRI and radiographic examinations of the knee were assessed during a period of five years after intervention. RESULTS: No complications or serious adverse event were associated with BMC implantation. From preoperative assessment to the latest follow-up, there was a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of clinical KSS (64.3 +- 9.7, range: 45-80 and 2.2 +- 4.1, range: 84-100, respectively), KFS (44.5 +- 8.0, range: 30-55 and 91.6 +- 5.8, range: 80-100, respectively) and reduction of NRS pain score (6.7 +- 1.2, range: 4-9 and 3.4 +- 1.0, range: 2-5, respectively). In total, 87% of patients (29/33) consistently experienced improvements in joint function and activity level as compared to preoperative score. No patient had additional surgery following BMC implantation. Radiographic assessment showed joint preservation and no progression to subchondral collapse at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of BMC implantation is a promising, relatively simple and safe procedure for OK in SCD patients. Larger and long-term controlled trials are needed to support its clinical effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02448121 . Retrospectively registered 19 May 2015.
33307945	Hemoglobin Target and Transfusion Modality for Adult Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Acute Chest Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of transfusion in treating sickle cell disease acute chest syndrome, the target hemoglobin and optimal modality for transfusion remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute chest syndrome transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL; and to compare hospital LOS in acute chest syndrome patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all acute chest syndrome patients treated in the medical ICU at 2 tertiary care hospitals between January 2011 and August 2016 (n = 82). We compared median hospital LOS in patients transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL by the time of ICU transfer to the medical floor versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL as well as patients who received exchange transfusion versus no exchange transfusion using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We modeled the association between hospital LOS and hemoglobin at ICU transfer to the medical floor using multivariable log-linear regression. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was about half as long for patients transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL versus hemoglobin < 8 g/dL (8.0 versus 16.5 days, P = 0.008). There was no difference in LOS for patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. On average, a 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin was associated with a 19.5% decrease (95% CI 10.8-28.2%) in LOS, controlling for possible confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion to a hemoglobin target >= 8 g/dL is associated with decreased hospital LOS in patients with acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in LOS between patients who received exchange transfusion and those who did not.
28249145	Gene Therapy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease results from a homozygous missense mutation in the beta-globin gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin S. Gene therapy for patients with this disorder is complicated by the complex cellular abnormalities and challenges in achieving effective, persistent inhibition of polymerization of hemoglobin S. We describe our first patient treated with lentiviral vector-mediated addition of an antisickling beta-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Adverse events were consistent with busulfan conditioning. Fifteen months after treatment, the level of therapeutic antisickling beta-globin remained high (approximately 50% of beta-like-globin chains) without recurrence of sickle crises and with correction of the biologic hallmarks of the disease.

30695814	Recombinant erythropoietin as alternative to red cell transfusion in sickle cell disease.	Disturbances in the physiological regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may contribute to worsening anaemia and increased transfusion requirements, but the use of recombinant EPO in this group of patients is controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of this drug in adult patients with SCD and its effects on haemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements. We conducted a retrospective analysis at the University of Campinas, with nineteen adults with a diagnosis of SCD (HbSS and HbS/beta+ thalassaemia), who had received at least 1 year of EPO therapy between 2007 and 2014. Haemoglobin concentrations and trends of variation in transfused RBC volumes were compared before and after EPO administration. We observed that seven patients had a good response to treatment (Hb increment higher than 1 5 g/dl) and nine had a partial response (0 5-1 5 g/dl increment) and there was a significant decrease in the need for transfusion amongst those who usually required regular transfusions. There were no increases in the rates of vaso-occlusive crisis or venous thromboembolism in comparison to the year before the onset of the therapy. Erythropoietin therapy led to a marked increase in haemoglobin concentration with a concomitant decrease in the demand for transfusion. Considering all complications related to allogeneic transfusion, we believe that EPO therapy represents an important therapeutic tool in sickle cell anaemia.
33892094	A pilot study of the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: In Part A of this two-part study, adolescents with SCD and chronic pain (Group 1) and their parent (Group 2) completed a survey designed to capture pain characteristics, attitudes and practices related to yoga, and potential acceptability of a yoga program. In Part B, the study assessed the feasibility and safety of an instructor-led group yoga program. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03694548). INTERVENTION: Eight instructor-led group yoga sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility and safety outcomes were chosen a priori, as follows: 1) Proportion of adolescent patients with SCD and chronic pain approached that consent to participate in Part A, 2) Proportion of adolescent participants enrolled in Part A that consent to participate in Part B, 3) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B that attend at least 6 of 8 yoga sessions, 4) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B with an ED visit or a hospitalization for pain within 24 h of completion of each yoga session, 5) Proportion of participants in Part B who complete all study assessments before, and at the end of the yoga program, 6) Adherence to submission of pain diary. RESULTS: The median age of 15 patient participants in Part A was 16 (IQR 14-17), and 14 parents was 43.5 (IQR 42-51). Most participants were female. Most participant responses indicated a positive opinion of yoga. Nine adolescents (60 %) from Part A participated in Part B of the study. The median age of 9 participants in Part B was 17 (IQR 15-18), and 5 of the 9 participants were female (53.3 %). Only one participant was able to attend 3 of the 8 yoga sessions offered, and did not experience any ED visits or hospitalizations following the yoga sessions. None of the other feasibility endpoints were met in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD and chronic pain overall have a positive opinion of yoga, but there are challenges with recruitment and retention of participants in a clinical trial of yoga, and barriers to feasibility of an in-person group yoga intervention.
32147045	Acupuncture for pain management in children with sickle cell disease.	Pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) is frequently treated with opioids which have many side effects. There is a need for adjuvant non-opioid therapies that can improve pain control. Acupuncture, an integrative approach, has been shown to be useful in non-SCD pain conditions but has been used to a very limited extent in SCD. In this report we present a single academic pediatric center experience showing acceptability, feasibility and improved pain experience with adjuvant acupuncture therapy in children with SCD and suggest that acupuncture should be explored as a treatment option for managing pain in SCD.
35485519	Rare emergency in children: Priapism and stepwise treatment approach.	BACKGROUND: Priapism is a rare condition in children and the treatment algorithm is controversial in this age group. Herein, we report eight cases with low-flow priapism and our stepwise treatment approach in light of literature. METHODS: We present a simple stepwise treatment for low-flow priapism including five steps. Step 1: Cold compress and analgesia while evaluation the priapism and its etiology. Step 2: Corporal aspiration and adrenaline infusion in the ward. Step 3: Modified Winter shunt in the same place. Step 4: Ketamine application and caudal block in the operating room. Step 5: Sapheno-cavernous (Grayhack) shunt. Eight cases with low-flow priapism were reviewed retrospectively. Symptoms, duration of tumescence, the interventions, and step that provide detumescence were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.5 years (1-17 y). The median time of the priapism before admission was 15 h (4-165 h). The etiological factors were sickle cell disease, hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, and factor V Leiden mutation in three patients. Detumescence was achieved in one patient at Step 2, in two patients at Steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Rigidity of cavernous body was observed in one patient in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Low-flow priapism is a urological emergency that may cause erectile dysfunction. Treatment options should be selected according to a protocol that prevents time loss and avoids more invasive treatment in unnecessary situations. Our algorithm with simple nature and its steps from less invasive to more invasive procedures may be an alternative for the treatment of low-flow priapism.
37059617	[Lung manifestations of sickle-cell disease].	Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of hemoglobin that causes systemic damage. Hypoxia is the main actor of sickle-cell disease. It initiates acutely the pathogenic cascade leading to tissue damages that in turn induce chronic hypoxia. Lung lesions represent the major risk of morbidity and mortality. Management of sickle-cell disease requires a tight collaboration between hematologists, intensivists and chest physicians. Recurrent episodes of thrombosis and hemolysis characterize the disease. New therapeutic protocols, associating hydroxyurea, transfusion program and stem cell transplantation in severe cases allow a prolonged survival until the fifth decade. However, recurrent pain, crisis, frequent hospital admissions due to infection, anemia or acute chest syndrome and chronic complications leading to organ deficiencies degrade the patients' quality of life. In low-income countries where the majority of sickle-cell patients are living, the disease is still associated with a high mortality in childhood. This paper focuses on acute chest syndrome and chronic lung manifestations.
28333416	Severe transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with hemoglobinopathies.	Incidence and severity of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) in patients with hemoglobinopathies receiving hematopoietic cell transplant is unknown. We report the outcomes for two patients with TA-TMA who received eculizumab. A 2.5-year-old male with sickle cell disease developed TA-TMA-associated pericardial tamponade, severe hypertension, and acute kidney injury 2 months after transplant. A 7-year-old female with beta-thalassemia major developed TA-TMA-related acute kidney injury, severe hypertension, and seizures at 6 months after transplant. Both patients progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with hemoglobinopathies, preexisting endothelial dysfunction may place them at a greater risk for TA-TMA and subsequent CKD.
31882437	Indications for RBC Exchange Transfusion in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Revisited.	Clinically, sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, recurrent acute vaso-occlusive crises, and progressive multi-organ failure. The management for SCD varies greatly among patients, and in the same patient longitudinally. Some patients may benefit from minimal therapy and infrequent transfusions, while others are transfusion dependent. Transfusion therapy can consist of simple transfusions, which often lead to iron overload and require iron chelation therapy. Simple transfusion, however, cannot reduce HbS levels rapidly, which may be required in certain critical conditions such as acute chest syndrome (ACS) or stroke. On the other hand, red blood cell exchange transfusion (RBCEX) can prevent iron overload and achieve rapid HbS reduction. In RBCEX, the red blood cells (RBCs) of the patient are replaced with normal RBCs, and the removed plasma is returned to the patient with minimal alteration. Plasma of patients with SCD is known to contain increased levels of several inflammatory mediators in the steady state that increase during crises. This finding explains why some patients with severe complications do not respond to RBCEX, but do much better after using plasma exchange in addition to RBCEX, as previously reported. Based on this, a revision of the indications for RBCEX in patents with SCD is recommended. DISCUSSION: In the 1980s and 1990s we used the Haemonetics Corporation's V-50 machine to perform intermittent whole blood (WB) exchange to treat severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD.) The results were excellent, as previously described [1].
31300265	Transfusing children with hemoglobinopathies.	Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are among the most common inherited diseases worldwide. Red blood cell transfusion is a cornerstone of their treatment, but its indications have significantly changed over the past years. New therapies are emerging in both syndromes: among them, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now routinely proposed, and gene therapy has shown promising preliminary results.
32890079	Timing of Alemtuzumab With Respect to Day of Bone Marrow Infusion and its Effects Upon Engraftment and Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Single-Institutional Study.	"The possible impact of ""late"" alemtuzumab (administered on days -10 to -8) versus ""early"" alemtuzumab (-19 to -17) with respect to engraftment and acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in a group of 25 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease undergoing bone marrow transplantation following conditioning with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan is reported. The first 9 patients received ""late"" alemtuzumab followed by bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched sibling donors. The next 16 patients undergoing matched sibling transplants received ""early"" alemtuzumab. In the ""late"" group, 1 patient (11%) developed acute GvHD. Six patients (67%) achieved sustained engraftment. Three patients (33%) experienced graft rejection, leading to termination of enrollment of patients on this regimen. In the ""early"" alemtuzumab group, acute and chronic GvHD developed in 43% and 25% patients, respectively. None of the patients experienced graft rejection in this group of patients. Three patients developed stable mixed chimerism and 13 patients demonstrated 100% donor chimerism at 1 year post-transplant and beyond. These results suggest a benefit with respect to engraftment of administering ""early"" versus ""late"" alemtuzumab in this reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, however, with the possible cost of an increase in acute, and possibly chronic GvHD."
38418772	Apadamtase Alfa: First Approval.	Apadamtase alfa (ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn; ADZYNMA), a human recombinant form of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13), is being developed by Takeda under license from KM biologics for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and sickle cell disease. On 9 November 2023, apadamtase alfa was approved in the USA for prophylactic and on-demand enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in paediatric and adult patients with congenital TTP. Apadamtase alfa is under regulatory review for congenital TTP in the EU and Japan, and is under clinical development for immune-mediated TTP in several countries worldwide. Clinical development of apadamtase alfa for vaso-occlusive crisis related to sickle cell anaemia is underway in the USA. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of apadamtase alfa leading to this first approval in the USA for congenital TTP.
30309846	Cerebral Blood Flow and Marrow Diffusion Alterations in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia after Bone Marrow Transplantation and Transfusion.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hematopoietic marrow hyperplasia and hyperperfusion are compensatory mechanisms in sickle cell anemia. We have observed marrow diffusion and arterial spin-labeling perfusion changes in sickle cell anemia following bone marrow transplantation. We aimed to compare arterial spin-labeling perfusion and marrow diffusion/ADC values in patients with sickle cell anemia before and after bone marrow transplantation or transfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed brain MRIs from patients with sickle cell anemia obtained during 6 consecutive years at a children's hospital. Quantitative marrow diffusion values were procured from the occipital and sphenoid bones. Pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion values (milliliters/100 g of tissue/min) of MCA, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery territories were determined. Territorial CBF, whole-brain average CBF, and marrow ADC values were compared for changes before and after either bone marrow transplantation or transfusion. Bone marrow transplantation and transfusion groups were compared. Two-tailed paired and unpaired Student t tests were used; P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Fifty-three examinations from 17 patients with bone marrow transplantation and 29 examinations from 9 patients with transfusion were included. ADC values significantly increased in the sphenoid and occipital marrow following bone marrow transplantation in contrast to patients with transfusion (P > .83). Whole-brain mean CBF significantly decreased following bone marrow transplantation (77.39 +- 13.78 to 60.39 +- 13.62 ml/100 g tissue/min; P < .001), without significant change thereafter. CBF did not significantly change following the first (81.11 +- 12.23 to 80.25 +- 8.27 ml/100 g tissue/min; P = .47) or subsequent transfusions. There was no significant difference in mean CBF between groups before intervention (P = .22). CONCLUSIONS: Improved CBF and marrow diffusion eventuate following bone marrow transplantation in children with sickle cell anemia in contrast to transfusion therapy.
33830027	Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis on Efficacy of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: An International Effort on Behalf of the Pediatric Diseases Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Sickle Cell Transplantation International Consortium.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects more than 300,000 children annually worldwide. Despite improved supportive care, long-term prognosis remains poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the sole validated curative option, resulting in sustained resolution of the clinical phenotype. The medical literature on allo-HCT for SCD is largely limited to children. Recent studies have evaluated allo-HCT efficacy in adults. Here, we conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis to assess the totality of evidence on the efficacy, or lack thereof, of allo-HCT in treating SCD. We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases on November 13, 2019. Four authors independently extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (overall survival [OS] and disease-free survival [DFS]) and harms (acute graft-versus-host disease [aGVHD], chronic graft-versus-host disease [cGVHD], nonrelapse mortality [NRM], and graft failure [GF]). Our search identified a total of 1906 references. Only 33 studies (n= 2853 patients) met our inclusion criteria. We also performed a subset analysis by age. Analyses of all-age groups showed pooled rates of 96% for OS, 90% for DFS, 20% for aGVHD, 10% for cGVHD, 4% for NRM, and 5% for GF. In the pediatric population, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 97%, 91%, 26%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. In adults, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 98%, 90%, 7%, 1%, 0%, and 14%, respectively. Our data show that allo-HCT is safe and effective, yielding pooled OS rates exceeding 90%. The high GF rate of 14% in adults is concerning and emphasizes the need to evaluate new strategies.
31684693	Regular long-term red blood cell transfusions for managing chronic chest complications in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, which can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Sickle cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and updated in 2014 and 2016. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine whether trials involving people with sickle cell disease that compare regular long-term blood transfusion regimens with standard care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show differences in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications; severity of established chronic chest complications; development and progression of chronic chest complications; serious adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Date of the last search: 19 September 2019. We also searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 14 November 2018), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 14 November 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of people of any age with one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, i.e. Hb SS, Sbetao, SC, or Sbeta+ that compared regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple or exchange transfusions) to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment, or to standard care that were aimed at reducing the development or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: No studies matching the selection criteria were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for randomised controlled trials looking at the role of long-term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions, such trials should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures to assess participants repeatedly before and after the intervention.
32259777	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease.	Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Clinical Oncology each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.

Young or immunocompromised children and those with underlying conditions such as sickle cell disease are particularly vulnerable to invasive disease. There has been an increase in the rate of resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella, which is associated with invasive disease and hospitalisation. The intracellular nature of non-typhoidal Salmonella protects against extracellular antibiotics and can facilitate disease relapse, particularly meningitis. Effective antimicrobial agents with good intracellular penetration include azithromycin, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. Antibiotic treatment of non-typhoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis is only indicated if there are risk factors for invasive disease as it can prolong excretion and does not shorten the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms. Optimal choice and length of therapy for gastroenteritis and invasive disease in children is not clear. Here, we provide a review of the literature and treatment recommendations.

29336892	Gene therapy and gene editing strategies for hemoglobinopathies.	Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is currently based on transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with an integrating lentiviral vector expressing a globin gene under the control of globin transcriptional regulatory elements. Studies and safety works demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficacy and safety of this approach, providing the rationale for clinical translation. The outcomes of early clinical trials, although showing promising results, have highlighted the current limitations to a more general application. These include the nature, source and age of repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, the suboptimal transduction efficiency and gene expression levels, the toxicity and efficacy of bone marrow conditioning, the stress status of bone marrow microenvironment in chronic diseases such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Recently, gene editing strategies based on the use of nucleases offered a novel approach to increase globin expression in a quasi-physiological way, independently from the addition of transgenes and viral sequences to the human genome. This review will discuss the current status of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease with a perspective towards the improvements necessary in the context of clinical translation.
32740518	The Liver in Sickle Cell Disease.	ABSTRACT: Liver involvement is found in nearly 40% of children with sickle cell disease. The most frequent complication is cholelithiasis. The most severe complication is acute hepatic crisis, with symptoms ranging from increasing jaundice to multiple organ failure and death. The emergency and mostly efficient treatment is exchange transfusion. Chronic cholangiopathy is increasingly recognized, with autoimmune features in most cases, worsened by chronic ischemia. Transfusion-related iron overload is not yet a concern in children, and hepatotoxicity of iron chelators is rare. We propose recommendations to prevent, explore, and treat these complications. We emphasize the close collaboration required between hepatologists and specialists of sickle cell disease.
36270432	Enrollment Lessons from a Biological Assignment Study of Marrow Transplantation versus Standard Care for Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Considerations for Future Gene and Cellular Therapy Trials.	We previously conducted a single-arm feasibility study (STRIDE1) of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The trial identified donors before entry, enrolled well, and found no unexpected regimen-related toxicity. Although many single-arm studies have been published, there are no controlled trials of either BMT or gene therapy in SCD. Therefore, we designed a comparative trial by biological assignment (available donor versus no donor). This multicenter National Institutes of Health-funded study (Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1503; STRIDE2) enrolled patients between 2016 and 2021 at 35 sites. Lagging recruitment led to study closure, and here we report the impediments to accrual. The BMT regimen and entry criteria were from STRIDE1, and 2-year survival was the primary endpoint. To minimize selection bias from prior HLA typing, STRIDE2 excluded individuals with previously identified donors. Accrual was stopped at 69% of target (138 enrolled; assigned 28 with donor, 96 with no donor). Barriers to enrollment included lower than expected frequency of HLA-matched related and unrelated donors; loss of enrollees owing to previously identified donors; conventional care arm dissuading some seeking BMT; challenging short-term endpoints in SCD, including incomplete documentation of sickle pain episodes; state Medicaid (primary insurers of SCD) denial of BMT coverage for adult SCD despite the study having secured Coverage with Evidence Development from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services; slowed accrual in 2019 to 2021 during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and restriction of BMT resourcing for nonmalignant diseases by academic medical (cancer) centers. Social obstacles and access to BMT centers also limited entry, as did practitioner and participant concerns over suitability, cost, and toxicity. Planning for future controlled trials of curative therapy in SCD and other nonmalignant diseases likely will meet these enrollment challenges. Lessons from this trial may aid the development of future comparative studies.
30773073	Overcoming challenges of venous thromboembolism in sickle cell disease treatment.	INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common comorbid condition found in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased mortality for adults with SCD. The pathophysiology that leads to the thrombophilic state in SCD has been previously reviewed; however, evidence-based guidelines to aid in diagnosis, prevention, and management of VTE are lacking. Areas covered: This review article will cover the pathophysiology underlying the hypercoagulable state, the epidemiology of VTE, and management strategies of VTE in SCD. Expert opinion: Providers should have a high suspicion for diagnosing VTE to help reduce morbidity and mortality in the SCD population. Unlike other thrombophilias, the risk of life-threatening anemia while being treated with anticoagulation is compounded with the potential complications surrounding red blood cell transfusions in this population (i.e. alloimmunization, hyperhemolysis) and this provides another complexity to managing VTE in this population. Clinical trials evaluating the risk and benefit of treatment and treatment duration are needed.
30783732	Inhaled steroids associated with decreased macrophage markers in nonasthmatic individuals with sickle cell disease in a randomized trial.	Inhaled mometasone was shown to improve pain scores and decrease soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) concentration in a randomized controlled trial of nonasthmatic patients with sickle cell disease. We sought to explore potential changes in systemic inflammation as a mechanism underlying this effect. Serum samples from 41 trial participants (15 placebo- and 26 mometasone-treated) were analyzed using a 92 inflammatory marker panel at baseline and after 8 weeks of mometasone therapy. Individual marker analysis and correlation analysis were conducted. Adjusted for age, the mometasone-treated group decreased the concentration of CXCL9, CXCL11, CD40, IL-10, and IL-18 relative to placebo-treated participants. Hierarchical clustering and correlation analysis identified additional evidence for a decrease in cytokines linking to macrophage signaling and migration. There was no statistically significant change in markers of asthma and allergy, indicating that the improvement was unlikely mediated by modulation of occult reactive airway disease. This analysis of inflammatory markers suggests that decrease in macrophage activity may be involved in the mediation of the clinical benefit seen with use of inhaled mometasone in nonasthmatic patients with sickle cell disease.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02061202.

29697146	Red blood cell specifications for patients with hemoglobinopathies: a systematic review and guideline.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions remain essential in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. Alloimmunization, a well-documented complication of transfusion, increases the risk of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, complicates crossmatching and identifying compatible units, and delays provision of transfusions. Guidance is required to optimize the RBC product administered to these patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An international, multidisciplinary team conducted a systematic review and developed, following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations to assist treating physicians and transfusion specialists in their decision to select RBCs for these patients. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (17 clinical studies and one cost-effectiveness study) were included in the systematic review. The overall quality of the studies was very low. In total, 3696 patients were included: 1680 with beta-thalassemia and 2016 with SCD. CONCLUSION: The panel recommends that ABO D CcEe K-matched RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and beta-thalassemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. In patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia who have developed clinically significant alloantibodies, selection of RBCs antigen negative to the alloantibody is recommended, if feasible. In these patients, selection of more extended phenotype-matched RBCs will likely reduce the risk of further alloimmunization. However, given the limited availability of extended phenotype-matched units, attention should be given to ensure that a delay in transfusion does not adversely affect patient care.
30067867	Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: an overview of Cochrane reviews.	BACKGROUND: Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD. METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals).In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event.Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence)In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence)In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence).In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no difference in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence)In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population.This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.
29524230	Transfusion-transmitted malaria masquerading as sickle cell crisis with multisystem organ failure.	BACKGROUND: Fever accompanying vaso-occlusive crisis is a common presentation in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and carries a broad differential diagnosis. Here, we report a case of transfusion-transmitted malaria in a patient with SCD presenting with acute vaso-occlusive crisis and rapidly decompensating to multisystem organ failure (MSOF). CASE REPORT: An 18-year-old African American male with SCD was admitted after multiple days of fever and severe generalized body pain. He received monthly blood transfusions as stroke prophylaxis. A source of infection was not readily identified, but treatment was initiated with continuous intravenous fluids and empiric antibiotics. The patient developed acute renal failure, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and shock. He underwent red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion followed by therapeutic plasma exchange and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. A manual peripheral blood smear revealed intraerythrocytic inclusions suggestive of Plasmodium, and molecular studies confirmed Plasmodium falciparum infection. Intravenous artesunate was given daily for 1 week. A look-back investigation involving two hospitals, multiple blood suppliers, and state and federal public health departments identified the source of malaria as a unit of RBCs transfused 2 weeks prior to admission. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion for transfusion-related adverse events, including hemolytic transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmitted infections, should be high in typically and atypically immunocompromised patient populations (like SCD), especially those on chronic transfusion protocols. Manual blood smear review aids in the evaluation of patients with SCD presenting with severe vaso-occlusive crisis and MSOF and can alert clinicians to the need for initiating aggressive therapy like RBC exchange and artesunate therapy.
30122533	Vertebral Bone Density Measurements by DXA are Influenced by Hepatic Iron Overload in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies.	Interference from metal hardware (piercings; buttons on clothing; and ingested material, e.g. barium) is well documented in bone health assessments by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). It is unknown if iron in hepatic tissue of highly iron-loaded patients could be mistakenly assessed by DXA as bone, and if this would lead to increased areal bone mineral density (aBMD) lumbar spine Z-scores derived by DXA. Our hypothesis is that iron in the liver of heavily loaded patients will artificially raise aBMD in the spine, and thereby lead to an error in the DXA scan. This study consisted of a retrospective chart review and re-analysis of DXA scans from patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia combined with prospective DXA and liver iron concentration (LIC) measurements from healthy controls. Patients who previously had both a DXA and LIC measurement were compared with controls. aBMD of individual vertebrae were analyzed and grouped by those that may be covered by the liver (L1 or L1/2) with those typically not (L3/4). Subjects were grouped by diagnosis and LIC severity. Phantoms were created to mimic the geometry of iron loaded liver tissue, and analyzed by DXA. A significant effect was observed in the difference of BMD Z-score of L1 and L 3/4 when patients with LIC < 1000 were compared to those with >5000 microg Fe/g wet tissue (p = 0.043). A significant relationship was also observed in the difference in aBMD Z-score of L1 and 3/4 when controls were compared to the high iron group (p = 0.037). These findings were supported by phantom experiments. These results suggest that there is a relationship between hepatic iron and increased L1 aBMD Z-scores in highly iron-loaded patients. Given patients with hemoglobinopathies are at increased risk for osteoporosis, clinicians should maintain a higher index of suspicion when diagnosing low bone mass.
28602485	A 5-year cost analysis of automated red cell exchange transfusion for the management of recurrent painful crises in adult patients with sickle cell disease.	The painful vaso-occlusive crisis is the most common acute manifestation of sickle cell disease resulting in poor quality of life and high utilisation of hospital facilities. The main disease modifying strategy is treatment with hydroxycarbamide. For patients intolerant or who fail hydroxycarbamide, chronic transfusions are an alternative. Automated red cell exchange transfusion (ARCET) are more effective in lowering rapidly the HbS level while avoiding iron overload. As they require specialised equipment and specially trained staff while utilising higher volumes of blood, there have been concerns regarding the costs involved. We retrospectively analysed data on 23 patients who have been on a regular programme for 1-5 years and found that their utilisation of hospital services reduced by 20%, 48%, 58%, 71%, and 79% after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. The overall mean annual cost of care per patient was $9702 and $2378 higher than baseline after the 1st and 2nd years of ARCET respectively and then reduced by $5486, $8317, and $14,664 after the 3rd, 4th and 5th year of ARCET respectively indicating that ARCET leads to cost savings to health services in the medium to long term due to reduction in hospital attendance of these patients.
34955521	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Previously Vaccinated Adolescent Female With Sickle Cell Disease.	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious complication that is observed most commonly in pediatric patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. However, the mechanism and predictors of disease are poorly understood. There are no prior reports of MIS-C among patients who have been fully vaccinated, and only a single case of MIS in an adult patient who had received his second shot just 4 days prior to symptom onset. Here, we present an adolescent with sickle cell disease who was fully vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and had no prior history of known or suspected infection, who presented in shock and was ultimately diagnosed with MIS-C. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for MIS-C even when patients are fully vaccinated.
29345446	The first South American case of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to select compatible embryo for cord blood transplantation as treatment for sickle cell anemia.	Sickle cell anemia is an inherited systemic hemoglobinopathy that affects hemoglobin production in red blood cells, leading to early morbidity and mortality. It is caused by a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.20A>T) in the beta-globin gene (HBB) that changes a glutamic acid to a valine in the protein. We present a case report of a fertile couple, both carriers of the sickle cell anemia mutation, with one affected daughter. Six cycles of assisted reproductive techniques were performed, resulting in 53 embryos in cleavage stage. Each embryo was biopsied and analyzed for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction, using polymorphic markers of the region of interest followed by capillary electrophoresis in an automated genetic analyzer. HLA Compatible and normal embryos for the mutation represented 3 (5.66%); while the carriers and compatible 6 (11.32%); therefore, embryos matching those of the affected daughter represented 9 (16.98%). A selected embryo in blastocyst stage was transferred, resulting in a healthy male newborn, who had the umbilical cord blood cells collected and stored. The affected daughter was immunosuppressed and received transplanted cells from the umbilical cord blood of her brother; the treatment was successful. Embryo selection using PGD technologies represent the most effective treatment plan for parents who want to have a healthy child, and it could cure another child already affected by inherited hemoglobinopathy.
38167227	Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever, purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.
30169977	Delivery approaches for CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics in vivo: advances and challenges.	INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic gene editing is becoming a viable biomedical tool with the emergence of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. CRISPR-based technologies have promise as a therapeutic platform for many human genetic diseases previously considered untreatable, providing a flexible approach to high-fidelity gene editing. For many diseases, such as sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia, curative therapy may already be on the horizon, with CRISPR-based clinical trials slated for the next few years. Translation of CRISPR-based therapy to in vivo application however, is no small feat, and major hurdles remain for efficacious use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in clinical contexts. AREAS COVERED: In this topical review, we highlight recent advances to in vivo delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system using various packaging formats, including viral, mRNA, plasmid, and protein-based approaches. We also discuss some of the barriers which have yet to be overcome for successful translation of this technology. EXPERT OPINION: This review focuses on the challenges to efficacy for various delivery formats, with specific emphasis on overcoming these challenges through the development of carrier vehicles for transient approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery in vivo.
34118373	Acupuncture as an Adjunctive Treatment for Pain in Hospitalized Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	CONTEXT: Acute episodes of pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) account for over 100,000 hospitalizations and expenses of nearly one billion dollars annually in the U.S. New treatment approaches are needed as the current opioid based therapy is often inadequate in controlling pain, resulting in prolonged inpatient stays, and high rates of readmission. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate acceptability of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy and explore the impact of acupuncture on pain related outcomes in a population of youth with SCD hospitalized for management of acute pain. METHODS: This IRB approved single center study recruited youth with SCD (9-20 years) who were hospitalized for management of acute pain into either the acupuncture group or controls. Both groups also received standard pain management therapies. RESULTS: Participants in the acupuncture (n = 19) and control (n = 10) group were comparable in clinical characteristics. Acupuncture had an acceptability rate of over 66% and was tolerated well without any side effects. Acupuncture was associated with reduction in pain scores (6.84-5.51; P < 0.0001). Acupuncture group demonstrated a trend toward lower length of stay and readmission rates, but these were not statistically significant. Opioid use was not different between the groups. Treatment Evaluation Inventory survey showed high rates of satisfaction with acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was broadly accepted and well-tolerated in our study population. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain scores immediately following the treatments, and a trend towards a reduction in length of stay and readmission for pain.

29313508	Evaluation of transfusion practices in sickle cell disease in Senegal: cohort study of 1078 patients with sickle cell disease.	Blood transfusion is an essential therapeutic tool in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Its indications and modalities vary from one country to another as a function of the clinical severity of the disease and the availability of blood products. This study seeks to evaluate the frequency and modalities of blood transfusions as well as their indications in patients with sickle cell syndrome at the Dakar hematology department from 1995 through 2015. This retrospective study reviewed the records of a cohort of 1078 patients with SS, SC, Sbeta0 and Sbeta + thalassemia sickle cell syndromes and collected data about the type of blood products, indications, modalities, and acute transfusion complications. The frequency of transfusion was adjusted for age, sex, and sickle cell profile. The patients' mean age was 23 years (2-44 years) and the sex ratio 0.9. SS disease was predominant (87.4 %); 28.5% had transfusions during the study period. Patients older than 20 years received more transfusions (P = 0.047). The frequency of transfusions did not differ significantly by gender (P = 0.12), but did by profile: a higher percentage of patients with SS disease required transfusion (P = 0.043). Acute anemia was the most common indication for transfusion (50.03 %). Acute transfusion complications were rare (5.8 %). This study shows that less than one third of sickle cell anemia patients in Senegal have transfusions, a finding that confirms that our patients have fewer transfusions than patients in other countries in Africa or in the West. This limited use of transfusion therapy may be related to a less severe level of disease among patients in Senegal, but also to the availability of blood products.
32888326	Successful management of sirolimus toxicity in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient using automated red blood cell exchange.	BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent used in organ rejection prophylaxis in solid-organ transplantation, graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and as an immune modulator for patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis and vascular malformations. Sirolimus has a narrow therapeutic index with potential severe side effects, including hypertension, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 19-year-old woman with severe sickle cell disease who underwent a matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, whose course was complicated by sirolimus toxicity. This case was challenging because sirolimus has no specific antidote, is largely bound to red blood cells (RBCs), has a high distribution volume, and cannot be removed by dialysis or plasmapheresis. RESULT: Due to the concern for toxicity, we looked into possibilities for rapid sirolimus clearance using automated RBC exchange. The treatment was effective in decreasing blood sirolimus levels within the therapeutic ranges. CONCLUSION: The use of RBC exchange is potentially safe and effective in the management of a case of sirolimus toxicity.
31089852	Paediatric intracranial aneurysms: a British institutional review.	INTRODUCTION: Paediatric intracranial aneurysms are rare, with a differing natural history and thought to account for only up to 7% of all intracranial aneurysms. There is much uncertainty that surrounds the prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and it is estimated to be anywhere between 2 and 90 per 1000. This is the largest British single-centre analysis of paediatric intracranial aneurysms. We present the patient course from their initial presentations to the outcome of treatment and evaluate a serial assessment of adequacy of aneurysmal obliteration radiologically. RESULTS: Twenty-two paediatric cases were identified that required treatment. The median age of presentation was 11.3 years (mean 9.9, range 0 to 15.9), 68% (15/22) were male and 77% (17/22) were ruptured on presentation. The majority of aneurysms were located at the anterior circulation (77% (17/22)). The overall median aneurysm size (n = 21) was 7.4 mm (mean 5 mm, range 2.5-19 mm). Twenty patients survived the acute phase and 80% (16/20) underwent coil embolisation and the other patients' surgical clipping. The overall outcomes were available for the 20 patients; on discharge, 90% (18/20) had a favourable clinical outcome (GOS score of 3-5). Treatment-specific clinical favourable outcomes were 88% (14/16) for coil embolisation against 100% (4/4) after surgical clipping. Of the two patients that died in the acute phase, one had sickle cell anaemia. Aneurysm aetiology was unknown in all other cases. None of the patients had a family history of aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Paediatric intracranial aneurysms while rare should be considered a differential diagnosis of children presenting with unexplained loss of consciousness with or without focal neurological deficit and/or headache. There is a two to one preponderance for males with a larger proportion of aneurysms within the posterior circulation (25%). Coil embolisation is the preferred method of securing a paediatric intracranial aneurysm.
32893706	How I Treat Acute Chest Syndrome in Asthmatic Children with Sickle Cell Disease. A Practical Review.	Asthma is associated with increased rate of acute chest syndrome (ACS), pain episodes and premature death. Differentiating between an acute asthma exacerbation and ACS is a challenge clinically as they can present with similar symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of asthma or broncho spasm in any children with sickle cell disease, as adequate treatments are required. In this mini-review, we selected 16 clinical studies, published in English between 2004 and 2016, and reviewed all of the abstracts and references of the selected articles. We subsequently selected articles that were focused on asthma in children with sickle cell disease. Given the pathophysiological mechanisms of ACS and the association between asthma and sickle cell disease, the management approach of asthmatic children should be clarified. Bronchodilators should be used if there are clinical features suggestive of a history of asthma or evidence of acute broncho spasm. The indication for cortisone should be reassessed. This literature review failed to conclude on therapeutic modalities of ACS in asthmatic children with sickle cell disease. Only a well designed, multicenter adequately-powered randomized controlled study of each of them will allow assessing their real benefits and risks.
30220449	Current state of apheresis technology and its applications.	Apheresis is at the forefront of therapeutic approaches for an increasing number of indications caused by formation of pathologic antibodies treated by therapeutic plasma exchange, or through the use of red cell exchanges to overcome complications secondary to sickle cell crises. Likewise, the number of hematopoietic stem cell transplants has continued to grow annually and this is the direct result of the expansion of apheresis collections. Over the years a number of apheresis platforms have been utilized, but as one of the oldest and most widely used systems, the COBE Spectra, has ceased to be used therapeutically and at blood centers for donations there is an active search to find suitable systems that will replace it and have the versatility to perform as many procedures as possible. Computer innovations have made it possible with current apheresis technology to obtain more real-time information of the procedure which permits the operator to adjust parameters not only to optimize the specific procedure but also to safeguard against potential adverse events. The focus of this review is to go over available clinical data describing the operation, outcomes and applications of apheresis platforms, and discuss those systems that are likely to meet clinical demands and those of blood donation centers.
32207531	Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives.	Genome editing technologies, particularly those based on zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat DNA sequences)/Cas9 are rapidly progressing into clinical trials. Most clinical use of CRISPR to date has focused on ex vivo gene editing of cells followed by their re-introduction back into the patient. The ex vivo editing approach is highly effective for many disease states, including cancers and sickle cell disease, but ideally genome editing would also be applied to diseases which require cell modification in vivo. However, in vivo use of CRISPR technologies can be confounded by problems such as off-target editing, inefficient or off-target delivery, and stimulation of counterproductive immune responses. Current research addressing these issues may provide new opportunities for use of CRISPR in the clinical space. In this review, we examine the current status and scientific basis of clinical trials featuring ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-based genome editing, the known limitations of CRISPR use in humans, and the rapidly developing CRISPR engineering space that should lay the groundwork for further translation to clinical application.
33711512	Pain in sickle cell disease: current and potential translational therapies.	Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD. In this review, we outline the challenges and need for validation of side-effects of opioids and provide an update on the development of mechanism-based translational therapies, specifically targeting pain in SCD.
36539362	Challenges and opportunities in shared care for international patients treated with cellular therapy for nonmalignant disease.	As cellular therapies gradually become the mainstay of treatment for several nonmalignant diseases, there appears to be varied accessibility to these therapies globally. Despite considerable burden of nonmalignant conditions, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and aplastic anemia in populations of low-middle-income countries, the utilization of cellular therapies remain sparse because of lack of resources. Globally, the frequency of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has increased disproportionately in countries with higher gross national income (GNI) per capita, governmental healthcare expenditures, and a high human development index. This leads to a large subset of international patients seeking care in the United States. This review summarizes the unique set of challenges that often arise when offering sophisticated therapies such as HSCT to international patients constituting of cross-cultural, logistical, financial, and medical challenges and the opportunities that are available to bridge the gap.
31026251	Health-related Quality of Life in Children With Sickle Cell Disease Undergoing Chronic Red Cell Transfusion Therapy.	Chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy is one of few disease-modifying treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD). This study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQL) in children receiving CRCT relative to 2 comparison groups: children with similar, severe SCD and children with milder disease risk defined by SCD genotype. For this study, 67 children with SCD between the ages of 8 and 18 completed the self-report Pediatric Quality of Life Sickle Cell Disease module (PedsQL SCD) as part of a pilot clinical program during routine hematologic visits. A medical chart review was also performed. Linear regression suggested that children in the CRCT group had significantly higher self-reported HRQL ratings for domains related to pain, F2,64=4.07 (P=0.022) and pain-related functioning, F2,64=4.32 (P=0.017), compared with children with similar and milder disease risk. Exploratory analyses implied that children in the CRCT group also had fewer worries about SCD-related complications, F3,63=9.68 (P<0.001). These patient-perceived benefits of CRCT may have important implications for treatment decisions and for providing ancillary support for children with SCD and their families.
37783810	Discontinued CRISPR gene therapy for sickle-cell disease improves symptoms.	
33246448	Proteus empyema as a rare complication from an infected renal cyst, a case report.	BACKGROUND: The most commonly isolated organisms in a parapneumonic effusion include S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. If unusual organisms are isolated from the pleural space, further investigation is warranted to locate the primary source. We present a patient with an infected chronic renal cyst found to have an empyema secondary to Proteus mirabilis to highlight the importance of further diagnostic workup when encountering unusual organisms in the pleural space. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old African-American female, with a past medical history of asthma and sickle cell trait, presented with 5 weeks of upper respiratory tract symptoms and chest pain. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was negative for a pulmonary embolism but revealed a loculated left sided pleural effusion with associated left-lower lobe consolidation. She was started on empiric antibiotics, and a chest tube was inserted with drainage of frank pus. Fluid gram stain was positive for gram negative rods. Intrapleural fibrinolytics were administered for 72 h given the presence of loculations. With no improvement following fibrinolytics, she was taken to the operating room for large bore chest tube placement and left visceral pleura decortication. Pleural fluid cultures speciated to Proteus mirabilis, so further cross-sectional imaging of her abdomen/pelvis was pursued to evaluate for a primary source. A complex cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney that communicated with the ipsilateral diaphragm was identified. Subsequent drainage and culture of the renal cyst was positive for Proteus mirabilis. Given clinical improvement following these interventions she was discharged with an extended course of antibiotics with plans for repeat imaging following completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While cases of Proteus mirabilis empyema have previously been reported as a consequence of conditions such as pyelonephritis, we present, to our knowledge, the first case of a Proteus mirabilis empyema as a consequence of an infected renal cyst communicating with the pleural space. This study highlights that further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is warranted when unusual organisms are found in the pleural space. Anatomic abnormalities that become apparent on imaging may help elucidate the source of infection.
34152394	Measures to reduce red cell use in patients with sickle cell disease requiring red cell exchange during a blood shortage.	The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in health care delivery, including a severe blood shortage. The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.
31431698	Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for chimerism-based tolerance.	High-dose cyclophosphamide given post-transplant (PTCy) successfully enables tolerance induction in HLA-mismatched related blood or marrow transplantation (haploBMT) manifested by low rates of graft failure, severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. When proceeded by nonmyeloablative conditioning, PTCy has also been associated with a low incidence of nonrelapse mortality. The safety of this platform has garnered interest in expanding its use to non-malignant indications for allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT). After success in a preliminary Phase I/II trial, use of a PTCy-based haploBMT platform is now being explored in a large Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) study for sickle cell disease. These emerging data in patients with hemoglobinopathies provided the rationale for exploring the use of PTCy in combined solid organ and BM transplantation as a means of tolerance induction through donor hematopoietic chimerism with a goal to obviate the need for a lifetime of immunosuppression. Several case reports, series, and small clinical trials have now been published of combined solid organ and alloBMT in patients with hematologic malignancies who had organ failure that would have been preclusive of alloBMT in the absence of solid organ transplantation. Here we will review the pre-clinical and clinical studies supporting the use of PTCy for chimerism-based tolerance induction.
34400054	Therapeutic approach to pediatric patients with acute chest syndrome: national multicenter survey of non invasive ventilation (NIV) and transfusion.	BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) have seen a spike in the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for many medical conditions. We sought to investigate the attitudes and clinical practice regarding the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) with a focus on NIV in pediatric ICUs. METHOD: Members of the French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care Emergencies (GFRUP) were asked to complete an online survey on physicians' attitudes toward children with ACS admitted to the PICU during 2015. RESULTS: The survey was answered by teams from 17 PICUs (240 beds). In total, 15 centers (88%) had a local transfusion unit and 14 (82%) worked in connection with a sickle cell disease (SCD) reference center. During 2015, 360 patients with SCD were managed (median: 7 per center; 21) of whom 137 (38%) for an ACS (median: 4 ACS per center; 8). The median length of PICU stay for ACS was 5 days (3.1). Among the 137 patients who presented with ACS, 73 (53%) received simple blood transfusion and 16 (12%) received exchange transfusion. For patients who required noninvasive ventilatory support, NIV with bilevel pressure (BiPAP) was the most frequent method (n = 68, 50%), followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 23, 17%) and high-flow oxygen (n = 21, 15%). The proportion of patients on BiPAP was up to 71% in the centers most frequently managing ACS patients. CONCLUSION: BiPAP is commonly used in PICUs for SCD patients with ACS, especially in trained centers. Future physiological studies and randomized controlled trials might help to choose the best ventilatory support for ACS.
29567367	With a simple calculation, the fraction of platelets remaining can be used to estimate the residual hemoglobin S percentage in sickle cell disease patients undergoing automated red blood cell exchange.	OBJECTIVES: Automated red blood cell exchange (RBX) is an important treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although not specifically targeted for removal, platelets (PLTs) are collected along with red blood cells during RBX. We sought to determine whether the pre- and post- RBX PLT counts could be used to derive the post-procedure hemoglobin S% (HgbS%). METHODS: Using the pre- and post- RBX lab values of 59 SCD patients undergoing 112 RBX procedures over 1 year, we derived mathematical formulas which estimate the post-RBX HgbS% based on the pre-RBX HgbS%, the pre- and post- RBX PLT, and a correction factor. RESULTS: For patients with pre-RBX HgbS > 40%, the mathematically derived post-RBX HgbS% was statistically indistinguishable from the measured post-RBX HgbS%. CONCLUSIONS: Using a simple formula, pre- and post-RBX platelet counts can provide a rapid approximation of the measured post-RBX HgbS% in patients with SCD.
29984534	Improvement of maternal and fetal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease treated with early prophylactic erythrocytapheresis.	BACKGROUND: The desire for pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) women has become a true challenge for hematologists, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Erythrocytapheresis (ECP) is an important therapeutic tool in SCD, but only limited data on starting time and the effects of ECP during pregnancy are available. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a double-center retrospective cross-sectional study on a total of 46 single pregnancies in SCD women from January 2008 to June 2017. ECP was started at 10.7 +- 5.2 weeks of gestation, and prophylactic enoxaparin (4,000 U daily) was introduced due to the reported high prevalence of thromboembolic events in pregnant SCD women. RESULTS: The alloimmunization ratio was 2.1 per 1,000 and the alloimmunization rate was 5.6%. In early ECP-treated SCD women, no severe vaso-occlusive crisis, sepsis or severe infection, or preeclampsia or eclampsia were observed. We found normal umbilical arterial impedance during pregnancy, suggesting an optimal uteroplacental function in early ECP-treated SCD women. This was also supported by the improvement in newborn birthweights compared to previous studies. In our cohort, three SCD women were started later on ECP (20-25 weeks), and gestation ended with late fetal loss. Placenta pathology documented SCD-related damage and erythroblasts in placental vessels, indicating fetal hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data generate a rationale to support a larger clinical trial of early ECP program in SCD pregnancy.
28946897	Undetectable haptoglobin is associated with major adverse kidney events in critically ill burn patients.	BACKGROUND: Intravascular haemolysis has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in different clinical settings (cardiac surgery, sickle cell disease). Haemolysis occurs frequently in critically ill burn patients. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of haptoglobin at admission to predict major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and AKI in critically ill burn patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-centre cohort study in a burn critical care unit in a tertiary centre, including all consecutive severely burned patients (total burned body surface > 20% and/or shock and/or mechanical ventilation at admission) from January 2012 to April 2017 with a plasmatic haptoglobin dosage at admission. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were included in the analysis. Their mean age was 49 (34-62) years, their median total body surface area burned was 29% (15-51%) and the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 25%. Early haemolysis was defined as an undetectable plasmatic haptoglobin at admission. We used logistic regression to identify MAKE and AKI risk factors. In multivariate analysis, undetectable haptoglobin was associated with MAKE and AKI (respectively, OR 6.33, 95% CI 2.34-16.45, p < 0.001; OR 8.32, 95% CI 2.86-26.40, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Undetectable plasmatic haptoglobin at ICU admission is an independent risk factor for MAKE and AKI in critically ill burn patients. This study provides a rationale for biomarker-guided therapy using haptoglobin in critically ill burn patients.
36602417	Time to pain relief: A randomized controlled trial in the emergency department during vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Compare time to pain relief (minimum of a 13 mm and 30% reduction) during an Emergency Department (ED) visit among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experiencing severe pain associated with a vaso-occlusive episode who were randomized to receive either an individualized or weight-based pain protocol. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial in two EDs. Adults with sickle cell disease. Research staff recorded pain scores every 30 min during an ED visit (up to 6 h in the ED) using a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Analysis included 122 visits, representing 49 patients (individualized: 61 visits, 25 patients; standard: 61 visits, 24 patients). RESULTS: Pain reduction across 6-h was greater for the individualized compared to the standard protocol (protocol-by-time: p = .02; 6-h adjusted pain score comparison: Individualized: M = 29.2, SD = 38.8, standard: M = 45.3, SD = 35.6; p = .03, Cohen d = 0.43). Hazards models indicated a greater probability of 13 mm (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.27, p = .03) and 30% (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.63, p = .01) reduction in the individualized relative to the standard protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received treatment with an individualized protocol experienced a more rapid reduction in pain, including a 13 mm and 30% reduction in pain scores when compared to those that received weight-based dosing.
38302122	Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to abnormal hemoglobin production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic hemolytic anemia, debilitating vaso-occlusive crises, and stroke. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of patients with SCD, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with SCD, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand SCD pathophysiology, use new graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all patients. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].
35767590	Evaluation of Guideline-Recommended Pain Management in Acute Sickle Cell Crisis and Its Effect on Patient Outcomes.	This was a retrospective, multi-site observational cohort of 233 encounters of patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who received analgesia for acute pain crisis related to SCD from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Patient encounters were categorized based on whether they received analgesia within guideline directed 60 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival. The primary outcome was time to a pain score reduction of >=30% on the numerical rating scale. Assessments were also conducted for potential disparities leading to suboptimal care. Time to pain score reduction of >=30% was significantly less in those receiving analgesia within 60 minutes of arrival compared to delayed analgesia [3.5 hours (2.5-10) vs 8.0 hours (4.5-22.5), p < 0.001]. Patients receiving timely analgesia also saw a faster time to ED disposition and achieved pain reduction goals more frequently at hospital discharge. We found that patients with a history of substance use disorder documented in their chart were less likely to receive timely analgesia. Our study indicated that when patients with SCD received analgesia in accordance with guideline recommendations, pain goals were achieved faster with an improvement in outcomes. Providing optimal care can be difficult, but education and standardized policies may help mitigate this gap.

31199090	A Phase 3 Randomized Trial of Voxelotor in Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization drives the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Therefore, direct inhibition of HbS polymerization has potential to favorably modify disease outcomes. Voxelotor is an HbS polymerization inhibitor. METHODS: In a multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of voxelotor (1500 mg and 900 mg, administered orally once daily) with placebo in persons with sickle cell disease. The primary end point was the percentage of participants who had a hemoglobin response, which was defined as an increase of more than 1.0 g per deciliter from baseline at week 24 in the intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: A total of 274 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a once-daily oral dose of 1500 mg of voxelotor, 900 mg of voxelotor, or placebo. Most participants had sickle cell anemia (homozygous hemoglobin S or hemoglobin Sbeta0-thalassemia), and approximately two thirds were receiving hydroxyurea at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a significantly higher percentage of participants had a hemoglobin response in the 1500-mg voxelotor group (51%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41 to 61) than in the placebo group (7%; 95% CI, 1 to 12). Anemia worsened between baseline and week 24 in fewer participants in each voxelotor dose group than in those receiving placebo. At week 24, the 1500-mg voxelotor group had significantly greater reductions from baseline in the indirect bilirubin level and percentage of reticulocytes than the placebo group. The percentage of participants with an adverse event that occurred or worsened during the treatment period was similar across the trial groups. Adverse events of at least grade 3 occurred in 26% of the participants in the 1500-mg voxelotor group, 23% in the 900-mg voxelotor group, and 26% in the placebo group. Most adverse events were not related to the trial drug or placebo, as determined by the investigators. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants with sickle cell disease, voxelotor significantly increased hemoglobin levels and reduced markers of hemolysis. These findings are consistent with inhibition of HbS polymerization and indicate a disease-modifying potential. (Funded by Global Blood Therapeutics; HOPE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03036813.).

32147073	Vitamin D supplementation and pain-related emergency department visits in children with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent inherited hematological disorder and affects 100,000 individuals in the United States. Pain is the most common cause of emergency department (ED) visits in the SCD population, which profoundly affects quality of life. Vitamin D supplementation is a potential target for reducing pain. Thus, the goal of the present study was to identify the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and explore the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and ED visits in pediatric patients with SCD. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 110 patients with SCD aged 8-16 years who had at least one ED visit for SCD pain during the 6-year study period. Patients were categorized into three vitamin D supplementation groups: patients who did not receive supplementation, patients supplemented with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (< 30 ng/mL), and patients supplemented with at least one sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (>= 30 ng/mL). RESULTS: Overall, 45 % of patients were vitamin D deficient. Only 20 % of patients had sufficient vitamin D levels. This number increased to 55 % when examining only patients who did not receive vitamin D supplementation. For patients supplemented with vitamin D, the number of ED visits was significantly lower after they reached the sufficient range (>= 30 ng/mL), p = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that reductions in the number of pain-related ED visits may be achieved by normalizing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with supplementation. In addition, findings highlight the need for screening and vitamin D supplementation being incorporated into routine care for pediatric patients with SCD.

34131897	Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease.	Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end-organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease-modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100 g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole-blood viscosity-related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

31045749	Do chronic pain and comorbidities affect brain function in sickle cell patients? A systematic review of neuroimaging and treatment approaches.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a medical condition in which chronic pain is common and negatively impacts psychosocial function and quality of life. Although the brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain are well studied in other painful conditions, the brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain and the associated psychosocial comorbidities are not well established in SCD. A growing literature demonstrates the effect of treatment of chronic pain, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, on brain function. The present systematic review aimed to (1) determine the effects of chronic pain and psychosocial comorbidities on brain function of patients with SCD; (2) summarize pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to treat these symptoms; and (3) identify areas for further investigation of potential beneficial effects of treatments on brain function. Titles were screened using predefined criteria, including SCD, and abstracts and full texts were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 1167 SCD articles were identified, and 86 full articles were included covering 3 sections: chronic pain (4 studies), psychosocial comorbidities (11 studies), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments (71 studies). Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates aberrant neural processing related to chronic pain and psychosocial comorbidities in SCD beyond ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. Although neuroimaging studies show an important role for psychological factors, pain management is nearly exclusively based on opioids. Behavior therapy seems useful to improve psychological symptoms as well as chronic pain and quality of life. Further investigation is required with larger cohorts, matched controls, and examination of treatment-related neural mechanisms.
38564204	A Novel Mechanistic Model for Future Research in the Elements of the ERAS Program in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team-developed approach to a surgical stress response that is implemented to optimize physiological function and facilitate recovery for the best possible outcomes from surgery. Although there are currently well-known published guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with sickle cell disease, there are currently no specific and evidencebased ERAS protocols that address the needs of these patients. A novel mechanistic model has recently been found that could change ERAS protocols for patients with sickle cell disease with regard to a current preoperative carbohydrate loading drink recommendation, nutrition and intravenous fluid management. ERAS has great benefits for most patient populations, but emerging research suggests that patients with sickle cell disease may process and respond differently to varying concentrations of serum glucose and serum cations (hyperglycemia and hypertonic states). This adverse response involves actin, a cytoskeletal protein, in the red blood cell and how increased hemoglobin glycosylation may lead to a malfunction in this protein and a transition to vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Further research is warranted with this new mechanistic model to develop more meticulous and customized perioperative management plans to address risk mitigation in patients with sickle cell disease.

34669981	Alemtuzumab clearance, lymphocyte count, and T-cell chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the cell surface antigen CD52 on lymphocytes. Although it is used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and incorporated into many hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning regimens, few studies have evaluated the pharmacology of alemtuzumab in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of alemtuzumab in adults with SCD who received a matched related donor HSCT to determine if the clearance of alemtuzumab affects transplant outcomes. DESIGN: PK and PD analysis of patient data from a single-center clinical trial. SETTING: Clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two adult patients with SCD who received one of two nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT regimens: alemtuzumab and total body irradiation (Alem-TBI) or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and total body irradiation (Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alemtuzumab serum concentrations, absolute lymphocyte counts, T-cell (CD3), and myeloid (CD14/15) chimerism were collected at distinct time points and analyzed. A semi-mechanistic PK population model was built to understand inter-individual differences in pharmacology. Alemtuzumab was detectable up to 28 days post-HSCT. The mean alemtuzumab level 7 days after transplant for patients on Alem-TBI was 818 ng/ml, significantly lower than the mean level of 1502 ng/ml for patients on Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI (p < 0.001), but this difference decreased as time progressed. The clearance of alemtuzumab was linear, and the half-life was longer in the Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 61.1 h) compared to the Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 44.1 h) (p < 0.001). The CD3 chimerism at 2 and 4 months after transplant positively correlated with alemtuzumab levels collected on day 14 after transplant (R2  = 0.40 and p = 0.004 at 2 months, R2  = 0.36 and p = 0.005 at 4 months), but this significance was lost by 6 months after HSCT. No correlation was seen between alemtuzumab levels and CD14/15 chimerism. CONCLUSION: Between 2 and 4 months after transplant, higher alemtuzumab levels measured 14 days after transplant correlated with patients having better engraftment, suggesting more lymphodepletion may be needed to reduce graft failure in these two non-myeloablative matched related donor HSCT regimens.

37688519	Molecular and environmental contributors to neurological complications in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy in which affected hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions resulting in red cell distortion and chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD affects millions of people worldwide, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Due to vaso-occlusion of sickled red cells within the microvasculature, SCD affects virtually every organ system and causes significant morbidity and early mortality. The neurological complications of SCD are particularly devastating and diverse, ranging from overt stroke to covert cerebral injury, including silent cerebral infarctions and blood vessel tortuosity. However, even individuals without evidence of neuroanatomical changes in brain imaging have evidence of cognitive deficits compared to matched healthy controls likely due to chronic cerebral hypoxemia and neuroinflammation. In this review, we first examined the biological contributors to SCD-related neurological complications and then discussed the equally important socioenvironmental contributors. We then discuss the evidence for neuroprotection from the two primary disease-modifying therapies, chronic monthly blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, and end with several experimental therapies designed to specifically target these complications.
37965881	Dermatologic complications in pediatric patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Dermatologic complications are common following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but dermatologic complications among pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of sickle cell disease have been poorly characterized. In this case series of 17 patients (<21 years old) with sickle cell disease who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 16 (94.1%) experienced one or more dermatologic complications after transplant, with the most common complications including acute or chronic mucocutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (34.1% of complications), skin eruptions of unknown origin (15.9% of complications), infections (15.9% of complications), and chemotherapy-related pigmentary changes (11.4% of complications). Patients who developed acute or chronic skin GVHD were significantly older at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor for dermatologic complications in pediatric patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease and underscore the importance of involving dermatology early on when skin complications occur, although further research with a larger multicenter study could help clarify the risk for dermatologic complications and help identify potential ways to mitigate this risk.

33155319	Clinical outcomes following bone marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: A cohort study of US Medicaid enrollees.	OBJECTIVES: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is currently the only curative therapy available for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but clinical outcomes in routine care are not well understood. We describe the rates of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), transplant complications, and mortality in SCD patients after BMT. METHODS: A cohort study of SCD patients who underwent BMT was designed using US Medicaid claims data (2000-2013). RESULTS: A total of 204 SCD patients undergoing BMT were identified with a mean (SD) age of 10.6 (7.3) years, with 52.9% male and 67.6% African American. The overall VOC rate was 0.99 per person-year (95% CI: 0.91-1.07) over a median follow-up time of 2.1 years (IQR: 0.8-4.3 years). A total of 138 (67.6%) remained free of VOCs. The mortality rate was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9-3.1) per 100 person-years, transplant-related complications occurred among 113 (55.4%) patients with an incidence rate of 38.2 (95% CI: 31.7-45.9) per 100 person-years, while 47 (23%) patients had GvHD with an incidence rate of 8.0 (95% CI: 6.0-10.7) per 100 person-years. CONCLUSION: Two thirds of the BMT recipients remained VOC-free over 2 years of follow-up, but transplant-related complications, including GvHD occurred with high frequency. This highlights a continuing unmet need for alternative curative interventions in SCD.

36516084	Outcomes following posttransplant viral-specific T-cell therapy in patients with sickle cell disease.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a curative approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). With the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), especially in the HLA-mismatched donors, intense immunosuppression is required leading to an increased risk of viral infection. Post-HSCT, adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell (VSTs) therapies have not been well-studied in SCD patients. Here, we report the outcomes of patients with SCD at a single-center who received VSTs post-transplant to prevent or treat virus infections. Thirteen patients who received HSCT from HLA-matched (n=9) or mismatched (n=4) donors for SCD were treated with a total of 15 VST products for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple viruses (cytomegalovirus, ebstein barr virus, adenovirus, BK virus, human herpes virus 6 +/- human parainfluenza virus 3). Of the patients evaluated, 46.2% (n=6)) received VSTs as treatment of virus infection. Eighty percent of patients with active viremia (n=4/5) achieved remission of at least 1 target virus. Seven additional patients (53.8%) received VSTs prophylactically and 6/7 (85.7%) remained virus-free post-infusion. No immediate infusion-related toxicities occurred, and severe de novo acute GVHD occurred in only 2 (15.4%) patients. Given the good safety profile, high-rate of clinical responses and sustained remissions when administered with standard anti-viral treatments, the routine use of VSTs post-HSCT as prophylaxis or treatment may improve the overall safety of transplant for patients with SCD.
36694913	Preschool Pain Management Program for Young Children with Sickle Cell Disease: A Pre-Post Feasibility Study.	OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive pain crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) often begin in early childhood. We developed an online pain management intervention to teach caregivers of preschool-aged children with SCD behavioral pain management strategies. The feasibility study goals were to examine response to recruitment, barriers to participation, engagement, acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention, and suitability of outcome measures. METHODS: Caregivers of children aged 2.0-5.9 years with access to text messaging and a device to access online videos were recruited from a Southeastern outpatient hematology clinic for a 12-week intervention consisting of pain management videos. Videos taught caregivers behavioral pain management strategies and adaptive responses to pain. Workbook activities helped tailor strategies to their child. Caregivers completed process measures as well as baseline and follow-up measures of pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale-Parent Report) and responses to their child's pain (Adult Response to Children's Symptoms). RESULTS: Fifty percent (10 of 20) of eligible parents enrolled. Caregivers partially completed (N = 6), completed (N = 3), or did not engage (N = 1) in the intervention. Caregivers who engaged in the program reported implementing the pain management strategies. The intervention was rated as high quality, relevant, and useful. Measures of pain catastrophizing and responses to their child's pain appeared sensitive to change. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention to promote adaptive coping to pain was acceptable and feasible for caregivers though we found barriers to delivering the intervention to parents. Evaluation of a modified version of the program is indicated to assess implementation issues and effectiveness.
37426651	Case report: Successful treatment with daratumumab for pure red cell aplasia in a patient with mixed lymphoid chimerism after ABO-mismatched stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease.	Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a serious complication after ABO-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Following HSCT, persistent anti-donor isohemagglutinins against donor ABO antigens are considered the immunological cause of PRCA. Patients with post-transplant PRCA are at risk for graft rejection and prolonged red blood cell transfusion dependency. No standard treatment exists. Recently however, the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab has been reported to be an effective treatment for post-transplant PRCA in patients with complete donor chimerism. Here, we describe the first case of PRCA in a patient with mixed lymphoid patient/donor chimerism that was successfully treated with daratumumab. This is also the first report of a transplant recipient with sickle cell disease who was treated with this relatively new approach. Fourteen months post-transplantation and twelve months after treatment with daratumumab, our patient has a normal complete blood count and the anti-donor isohemagglutinins remain undetectable despite mixed lymphoid chimerism. Mixed chimerism is a common manifestation in adult patients with sickle cell disease transplanted with non-myeloablative conditioning and a matched sibling donor. The application of non-myeloablative HSCT for patients with sickle cell disease is steadily increasing. Therefore, the incidence of PRCA in this setting might also increase. As the risk of graft rejection due to PRCA can be especially high in patients with mixed chimerism, clinicians should be aware that daratumumab can be an effective treatment in the setting of mixed chimerism.
35135795	Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease.	Sideroblastic anaemia is a rare condition. We report a unique case of concomitant sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease with long-standing blood transfusion history. Due to a low prevalence of sideroblastic anaemia, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemia is often difficult, especially when coexisting with common types of anaemia, including sickle cell disease. This case highlights the detrimental effects of anchoring bias. Rare causes of refractory anaemia should be considered in patients with haemoglobin disorders as the therapeutic approaches for these conditions are different. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and low threshold for workup of anaemia often aids in the diagnosis of coexisting conditions such as sideroblastic anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment of sideroblastic anaemia improves patient outcomes and prevents long-term complications.
36100552	Transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an essential treatment for many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), whose RBCs express hemoglobin S (HbS), a mutated form of hemoglobin A (HbA). Transfusion goals include increasing blood oxygen carrying capacity and decreasing the relative amount of HbS to HbA to mitigate vaso-occlusion in small blood vessels. In situations where correction of severe anemia and reduction in HbS may be achieved without removal of RBCs, simple transfusion may be utilized. Partial manual RBC exchange, which removes blood containing HbS by phlebotomy and replaces with donor blood transfusion sequentially allows for larger changes in the ratio of HbS to HbA when compared to simple transfusion. Automated RBC exchange by apheresis is useful in situations where a rapid and drastic HbS reduction is indicated. Vascular access is an important consideration for transfusion. Although peripheral access may be sufficient, central venous catheters and implantable venous access devices may be necessary for adequate access over time. Blood bank considerations include adequate RBC antigen matching to mitigate the risk of RBC alloimmunization, of which patients with SCD are at risk of developing. Transfusion may be utilized in efforts to intervene in the evolution of potentially life-threatening complications of SCD such as acute stroke, severe acute anemia and acute chest syndrome. Transfusion is also useful in several non-acute settings, such as stroke prevention, pregnancy, pre-surgery, and transfusion support for curative therapies. Individualized treatment plans are an essential component of patient care. Continuous evaluation of clinical indications and evolution of guidelines will continue to optimize care for patients with SCD.
29127680	Gene Addition Strategies for beta-Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia.	Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are two of the most common diseases related to the hemoglobin protein. In these diseases, the beta-globin gene is mutated, causing severe anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis. Patients can additionally present with a number of life-threatening co-morbidities, such as stroke or spontaneous fractures. Current treatment involves transfusion and iron chelation; allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the only curative option, but is limited by the availability of matching donors and graft-versus-host disease. As these two diseases are monogenic diseases, they make an attractive setting for gene therapy. Gene therapy aims to correct the mutated beta-globin gene or add back a functional copy of beta- or gamma-globin. Initial gene therapy work was done with oncoretroviral vectors, but has since shifted to lentiviral vectors. Currently, there are a few clinical trials underway to test the curative potential of some of these lentiviral vectors. This review will highlight the work done thus far, and present the challenges still facing gene therapy, such as genome toxicity concerns and achieving sufficient transgene expression to cure those with the most severe forms of thalassemia.
33228943	Pulmonary Manifestations of Hematologic and Oncologic Diseases in Children.	Pulmonary complications are common in children with hematologic or oncologic diseases, and many experience long-term effects even after the primary disease has been cured. This article reviews pulmonary complications in children with cancer, after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and caused by sickle cell disease and discusses their management.
33688634	MOLECULAR MEDICINE: Found in Translation.	Studies of the major hemoglobin disorders, beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), have laid a foundation for molecular medicine. While enormous progress has been made in understanding gene structure and regulation, translating molecular insights to therapy for the many individuals affected with these disorders has been challenging. Advances in three activities have recently converged to bring novel genetic and potentially curative treatments to clinical trials. First, improved lentiviral vectors for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells have revived somatic gene therapy for blood disorders. Second, elucidation of regulatory factors and mechanisms that control the normal developmental switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin has provided a route to reactivation of the fetal form for therapy. Third, revolutionary methods of gene engineering permit molecular insights to be leveraged for patients. Here I review how the promise of molecular medicine to bring transformative treatments to the clinical arena is finally being realized.
31476954	Reversal of Severe Multiorgan Failure Associated With Sickle Cell Crisis Using Plasma Exchange: A Case Series.	OBJECTIVE: Red blood cell exchange (RBCE) is the standard of care for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who present with severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). However, subsets of these critically ill patients have progressive multiorgan failure (MOF) despite RBCE therapy. The purpose of this case series is to describe the use of plasma exchange (PLEX) for the treatment of SCD-related MOF that is refractory to RBCE. METHODS: A retrospective case review of patients with severe MOF from sickle cell crisis unresponsive to RBCE who underwent PLEX in a 14-bed adult medical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary care university hospital over a 4-year time period. Key laboratory data including complete blood count, indices of hemolysis, and markers of organ failure were recorded before and after both RBCE and PLEX. RESULTS: Our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of PLEX, in addition to RBCE, on organ dysfunction, laboratory indices, and mortality. Of the 7 patients, 6 survived. Of the patients who survived, all remained hemodynamically stable during PLEX sessions and showed both clinical and laboratory evidences of improvement in hemolysis and organ function. Average time from completion of first PLEX treatment to initial laboratory signs of organ failure reversal for patients who survived was 15.6 hours, the average length of stay in the ICU was 5.6 days, and the average total length of stay in the hospital was 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma exchange, in addition to RBCE, may be a novel synergistic treatment option to decrease risk of mortality in patients with refractory VOC and MOF.
32812667	Automated exchange compared to manual and simple blood transfusion attenuates rise in ferritin level after 1 year of regular blood transfusion therapy in chronically transfused children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Optimal strategies for regular blood transfusion therapy are not well defined in sickle cell disease (SCD). This analysis tested the hypothesis that in the first of year of regular transfusions, when chelation therapy use is minimal, automated exchange transfusion would be the superior method for attenuating the rise in ferritin levels compared to simple and manual exchange transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Silent Cerebral Infarct Multi-Center Clinical Trial randomly allocated children with SCD and silent cerebral infarcts to receive standard care or regular transfusions with a target pre-transfusion HbS concentration <= 30% and minimum hemoglobin level > 9.0 g/dL. Participants with at least nine transfusions and sufficient ferritin testing in the first year of the trial were included in a planned secondary analysis. Ferritin levels by the end of the first study year were compared between participants receiving automatic exchange transfusion, manual exchange transfusion, and simple transfusion. RESULTS: A total of 83 participants were analyzed. During the first year of the study, 75.9% of the participants had >80% of transfusions via one transfusion method. At baseline no significant differences in ferritin levels were observed in the three transfusion groups (p = 0.1). After 1 year of transfusions the median (interquartile range) ferritin levels in the simple transfusion (n = 40), manual exchange transfusion (n = 34) and automatic exchange transfusion (n = 9) groups were 1800 ng/mL (1426-2204 ng/mL), 1530 ng/mL (1205-1805 ng/mL), and 355 ng/mL (179-579 ng/mL), respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Automated exchange transfusion, when compared to other transfusion methods, is the optimal transfusion strategy for attenuating increase in ferritin levels in children with SCD.

29098436	Low-impact laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with decreased postoperative morbidity in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is one of the most frequent surgeries performed in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). LC in SCD patients is associated with a particularly high postoperative morbidity. The aim of the present study is to assess the safety and feasibility of cholecystectomy performed by mini-laparoscopy with low- and stable-pressure pneumoperitoneum (MLC + LSPP) and to compare the rate of postoperative SCD-related morbidity with standard LC. METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive SCD patients admitted between November 2015 and March 2017 for cholelithiasis requiring surgery were compared with an historical cohort of 126 SCD patients who underwent LC for the same indication. Operative variables, postoperative outcomes, patient and surgeon satisfaction, and costs were evaluated. RESULTS: MLC + LSPP exhibited a mean operative time comparable to LC (p = 0.169). Operative blood loss was significantly reduced in the MLC + LSPP group, and the suction device was rarely used (p = 0.036). SCD-related morbidity (including acute chest syndrome) was significantly higher in the LC group compared with the MLC + LSPP group (18.3 vs. 2.9%; p = 0.029). The mean times to resume ambulation (p = 0.018) and regular diet (p = 0.045) were significantly reduced in the MLC + LSPP group. The mean incision length (all trocars combined) was 28.22 mm for MLC + LSPP and 49.64 mm for LC patients (p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the only significant predictor of postoperative SCD-related morbidity was the surgical approach (odds ratio: 9.24). Patient and surgeon satisfaction were very high for MLC + LSPP. The mean total cost per patient (surgery and hospitalization) was not different between groups (p = 0.084). CONCLUSION: MLC + LSPP in SCD patients appears to be safe and feasible. Compared with LC, MLC + LSPP in SCD patients is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative SCD-related morbidity and more rapid ambulation and return to regular diet without increasing the total costs per patient.
36485131	Organ function indications and potential improvements following curative therapy for sickle cell disease.	"Curative therapies for sickle cell disease include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene-modified autologous stem cell transplantation. HSCT has been used for 30 years with success measured by engraftment, symptom control, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) risk, organ toxicity, and immune reconstitution. While human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants have excellent outcomes, alternate donor transplants (unrelated/haploidentical) are just beginning to overcome GVHD and engraftment hurdles to match MSD. Gene therapy, a newly developed treatment, is undergoing careful evaluation in many trials with varying approaches. The risk/benefit ratio to the patient in relation to outcomes, toxicities, and mortality risk drives eligibility for curative interventions. Consequently, eligibility criteria for MSD transplants can be less stringent, especially in the young. Posttransplant outcome analysis after the ""cure"" with respect to organ function recovery is essential. While established damage such as stroke is irreversible, transplant can help stabilize (pulmonary function), prevent further deterioration (stroke), improve (neurocognition), and protect unaffected organs. Tracking organ functions postintervention uniformly between clinical trials and for adequate duration is essential to answer safety and efficacy questions related to curative therapies. Age-appropriate application/outcome analyses of such therapies will be the ultimate goal in overcoming this disease."
30896312	Comparison of Parenteral Opioid Dosing in Adult Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Vaso-occlusive Crisis.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic condition characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive complications, including acute pain crisis. The mainstay of treatment for patients presenting with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is pain control and adequate hydration. Currently, there are no studies to determine an optimal pain control regimen in adult SCD patients. The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether outcomes differ in patients with VOC based on pain management treatment modality. A retrospective review of admissions with a primary diagnosis of VOC admitted to our facility was conducted. The primary outcome was to compare the average length of stay (LOS) in patients treated with intermittent injection (INT) or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Secondary outcomes assessed included 30-day readmission, treatment failure, and impact on pain scores. Of 302 admissions screened, 150 met inclusion criteria (INT: n = 100; PCA: n = 50). Selection of initial pain control regimen showed no difference in average LOS (INT: 5.96 +- 4.19 days vs. PCA: 6.01 +- 3.47 days; P = .94) or 30-day readmission rates (INT: 21% vs. PCA: 16%; P = .52). Treatment failure was significantly higher in the INT group, occurring in 64% of patients vs. 14% in the PCA group (P < .0001). Pain scores were not significantly impacted by selection of pain regimen. Our study indicates that INT and PCA treatment modalities are both effective at controlling pain in VOC; however, more patients in the INT group were characterized as having a treatment failure. Based on our results, it is reasonable to initiate PCA as the primary pain treatment strategy in SCD patients presenting in VOC.
36637364	Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis in a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic red cell exchange.	BACKGROUND: Prior to laboratory-based blood donor screening for Babesia, transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) was a leading infectious risk to the blood supply in the United States. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old man with sickle cell disease (SCD) who had been on a chronic automated red cell exchange (RCE) regimen since childhood, presented approximately 2 months after an RCE, with fever, neck pain, and photophobia. Meningitis was excluded, and he was discharged. He presented again 2 days later with persistent fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. RESULTS: On examination, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. Intra-erythrocytic inclusions were identified on a peripheral blood smear (<0.5%). B. microti IgM and IgG titers were >1:320 (Reference <1:20) >1:1024 (Reference <1:64), respectively. B. microti was confirmed by nucleic acid testing. The patient lived in a Babesia endemic state but had no risk factors for tick-borne acquisition. Of the 65 units he received in the preceding 6 months, 58 had been screened for Babesia. One of the donors of the 7 untested units was B. microti seropositive (titer 1:128; Reference 1: 64). The donor was asymptomatic and resided in a state in which Babesia screening was not required. He reported traveling in the year before his donation. CONCLUSION: Although rare, TTB is still possible despite regional screening, underscoring the need for provider vigilance and education, especially in non-endemic areas. Patients with SCD are particularly vulnerable given their high frequency of transfusion and complex needs requiring blood procurement from states where Babesia screening is not mandatory.
28093814	Management of sickle cell disease in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

36129238	Outcomes of patients who underwent treatment for anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies before receiving a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant.	Pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients who receive many blood product transfusions, such as individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or indolent hematologic malignancies, are at high risk for developing donor-specific antibodies (DSA). DSAs with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than 5000 have been associated with significant graft failure, but lower MFI values between 2000 and 5000 may result in poor graft function after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Desensitization strategies have been developed to reduce the DSA burden in HCT recipients before graft infusion, but the experience with these strategies in the pediatric and AYA populations is not well described in the literature. Here, we describe our experience with successful desensitization by using a combination of treatment strategies in five pediatric and AYA patients, including a novel use of daratumumab in a young adult patient who had refractory DSAs and had suffered serious side effects from conventional desensitization strategies. The presence of elevated DSAs in pediatric and AYA recipients of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched haploidentical HCT can be overcome by a multipronged treatment strategy.
32629539	Red blood cell exchange to avoid intubating a COVID-19 positive patient with sickle cell disease?	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim lives across the globe, insufficient data exists regarding the optimal treatment. It is well known that patients 55 years of age or older and patients with certain chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. A potentially fatal pulmonary complication of sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome, can be precipitated by acute infections, including respiratory viruses. We report the case of a patient with sickle cell disease (HbSC) who developed COVID-19 pneumonia and acute chest syndrome who was treated with emergent red blood cell exchange in order to avoid endotracheal intubation.
35972175	Preoperative Transfusion and Surgical Outcomes for Children with Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommending preoperative transfusion to a hemoglobin level of 9 to 10 g/dL for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are based on imperfect evidence. The benefit of preoperative transfusion in children specifically is not known. This study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative RBC transfusion is associated with different rates of sickle cell crisis and surgical complications, compared with no preoperative transfusion, among children with SCD undergoing common abdominal operations. STUDY DESIGN: The NSQIP-Pediatrics database (2013 to 2019) was queried. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy, splenectomy, or appendectomy with a preoperative Hct level of less than 30% were included. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis. Secondary outcomes were 30-day surgical complications and hospital length of stay. Propensity score matching methods were used to obtain two statistically similar cohorts of patients comprised of those who were preoperatively transfused and those who were not. RESULTS: Among 357 SCD patients, 200 (56%) received preoperative transfusion. In the matched cohort of 278 patients (139 per group), there was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis in the transfused and non-transfused groups (5.8% vs 7.2%, p = 0.80). The rate of 30-day surgical complications did not differ between matched groups (10.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.84). Subgroups defined by presenting Hct levels of 27.3% or greater or less than 27.3%, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, wound class, and index operation were not associated with an altered risk of sickle cell crisis or surgical complications after preoperative transfusion compared with no transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative transfusion for children with SCD undergoing semi-elective abdominal operations was not associated with improved outcomes. Prospective investigation is warranted to strengthen guidelines and minimize unnecessary perioperative transfusions in this population.
31136312	Patient-controlled Analgesia For Vaso-Occlusive Crisis: A Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) accounts for over 68,000 hospital admissions each year in the United States, with long inpatient length of stays (LOS) and frequent readmission common. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been used to treat patients admitted with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), but it is unknown if PCA is associated with shorter LOS and reduced risk of readmission. METHODS: We examined all admissions for acute VOC treated with parenteral opioids to an urban, academic health system over 3 years. We compared LOS, 30-day readmission, and discharges against medical advice between admissions treated with PCA versus standard therapy in unadjusted and adjusted analyses using generalized estimating equations to adjust for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 823 admissions included, 536 (65.1%) were treated with PCA and 287 (34.9%) were treated with standard nurse-administered opioid therapy. Treatment with PCA was associated with significantly shorter LOS in the unadjusted analyses (7.46 vs. 9.42 d, P=0.001), but the difference was not significant after adjustment (adjusted difference: 1.47 d, P=0.06). Treatment with PCA was also associated with significantly decreased risk of 30-day readmission in unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR]unadj: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.89, P=0.004), but after adjustment the association was no longer significant (ORadj: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.54-1.06, P=0.11). Finally, treatment with PCA was not associated with increased risk of discharge against medical advice in Generalized Estimating Equation modeled unadjusted (ORunadj: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.69-1.76, P=0.68), or adjusted analysis (ORadj: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.73-1.94, P=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with PCA may be associated with shorter LOS and may be considered as the primary modality for opioid-based pain control for patients with SCD who are admitted with painful VOC.
32921398	[Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children and adults with sickle cell disease: Indications and modalities].	Sickle cell disease is associated with severe complications and early mortality in adults. In children, hematopoietic stem cell transplant from HLA-identical sibling can stop the progression of the disease and leads to more than 95% long-term free survival without sickle cell disease. The aim of this workshop was to define indications and modalities of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children and adults with sickle cell disease. Patient and sibling HLA typing should be proposed, early in the course of the disease, when intensification therapies are required. Indications of transplant from HLA-identical sibling in children and adults are, cerebral vasculopathy, occurrence of vaso-occlusive events despite hydroxycarbamide, renal and hepatic diseases related to SCD, chronic anemia<7g/dL despite hydroxycarbamide, need to maintain transfusion programs longer than six months, and major transfusion difficulties related to red blood cell alloimmunization. In children with an HLA-identical sibling donor, we recommend a myeloablative conditioning regimen associating high dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide and ATG, considering the excellent results of this approach In patients over 15 years of age, we recommend the NIH approach consisting of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen by alemtuzumab, and 3Gy total body irradiation, followed by peripheral hematopoietic stem cells and post-transplant immunosuppression by sirolimus In the absence of HLA-identical sibling donor, there is no definitive data for preferring transplant from unrelated versus haplo-identical donors but we recommend to evaluate these approaches in prospective trials.
28089760	Enhanced Long-Term Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluation of Children with Sickle Cell Disease after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.	Progressive neurovasculopathy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) results in decreased cognitive function and quality of life (QoL). Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is believed to halt progression of neurovasculopathy. Quantitative analysis of T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden provides a meaningful estimate of small vessel cerebrovascular disease. We asked if quantitative analysis of WMH could complement standardized clinical assessment of MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for assessing SCD central nervous system vasculopathy before and after HCT. Retrospective longitudinal clinical examination of scheduled annual MRI/MRA and quantitative analysis of WMH were performed before and 1 to 7 years after HCT at scheduled annual intervals, along with QoL measurements, in children who had engrafted after HCT. Of 18 patients alive and persistently engrafted (median age, 9.1 years), pretransplantation MRI demonstrated that 9 and 5 had sickle-related stroke and/or small infarcts, respectively. Patients were divided into WMH severity tertiles based on pretransplantation WMH volumes. MRI and WMH were assessed 1 to 7 years after HCT. MRI/MRA and WMH volume were stable or slightly better in 17 of 18 patients. By parent- and self-report, post-HCT QoL improved for children in the lowest WMH tertile significantly more than in the other groups. Based on this single-institution retrospective sample, we report that WMH appears to quantitatively support MRI-based findings that HCT stabilizes long-term small and large vessel cerebrovascular changes and is associated with the degree of improved QoL. While confirmation in larger prospective studies and evaluation by neurocognitive testing are needed, these findings suggest that WMH is a useful biomarker of neurovasculopathy after transplantation for SCD.
28094851	Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 04 April 2016.We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease.Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents).The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusionsLong-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence.Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants)We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence.Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks).The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelationNeither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants)Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants)Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease.In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications.In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration.In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events.All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.
35773052	Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: Beta-Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease.	beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and are potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after genetic modification. Autologous gene therapy has the potential to offer a universal cure that overcomes many limitations of allogeneic HSCT including the lack of available donors, graft-vs-host disease, and graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for the hemoglobinopathies has been made over the last several decades, now with multiple ongoing clinical trials investigating both gene addition and gene-editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of hemoglobin disorders.
32169623	The association between vitamin D deficiency and hospitalization outcomes in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: While there is a known association between low vitamin D levels and increased chronic pain in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), there are no reported studies evaluating the relationship of vitamin D levels and hospitalization outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship with hospitalization outcomes defined as the number of emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of hospital stay. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with SCD (1-21 years old) was performed from January 2015 to January 2016 in an urban-based hospital setting (n = 134). Those with at least one reported Vitamin D level who maintained follow up during the time studied were enrolled (n = 90). Patient hospitalizations rates were compared between vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) and sufficiency (>20 ng/ml). RESULTS: Patients with both SCD and vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have at least one Emergency Room visit (p < 0.01), at least one admission for pain crisis (p < 0.01), and a longer length of admission (p < 0.0001) when compared to patients with SCD and sufficient vitamin D levels. CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between vitamin D levels of <20 ng/ml and the number of ER visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of stay in patients with SCD. Further research is required to assess if correcting vitamin D levels may improve hospitalization outcomes in this population.
37309787	[Management of acute complications of sickle cell disease].	MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Acute complications are the most frequent causes of hospitalization and morbidity in patients with sickle cell disease. Vaso-occlusive crisis are responsible of more than 90% of hospitalization, but numerous acute complications can affect multiples organ or function, that may be life-threatening. Thus, a single reason for hospitalization may include many complications such as worsening of an anemia, vascular disease (stroke, thrombosis, priapism), acute chest syndrome, liver or spleen sequestration. Evaluation of acute complications includes the understanding of chronic complications, particularities related to patient's age, the search for a triggering factor and a differential diagnosis. Analgesia and venous access difficulties, post transfusion immunization, medical history of the patient can make the management of acute complication particularly complex.
38488686	Favorable outcome of non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation in adult patients with severe sickle cell disease: A single center experience of 200 patients.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curative but not commonly utilized therapy due to complications such as graft failure (GF) and organ toxicity. Herein, we are reporting our long-term outcome data of non-myeloablative (NMA) HSCT in adults with severe SCD with emphasis on factors predicting event free survival (EFS). Adults with severe SCD undergoing NMA match-related donor allogeneic HSCT from 2015 to 2021 with at least 12 months of follow-up were included. A total of 200 patients were included with a median age of 26 years (14-43) and 56% were male. The median infused CD34 dose was 13.7 (5.07-25.8), respectively. Median absolute neutrophil count engraftment was 19 (13-39) days with 51% of patients receiving GCSF to expedite recovery. A total of 17 patients experienced GF; 3 as primary and 14 as secondary within a median time of 204 days (40-905). A 76% successfully discontinued sirolimus at the last follow-up. Median follow-up for the cohort is 29.2 (2.1-71.4) months. Estimated 3-year EFS and OS were 88.2% (81.9-92.5) and 94.6% (89.2-97.3). At multivariable analysis, minor ABC incompatibility hazard ratio (HR) 4 (1.3-12.1; 0.014) and allo-antibody against non-ABO donor antigens HR 4.3 (1.3-14.1; 0.016) were significant for EFS. No clonal evolution or myeloid malignancies were seen. This largest single-center report of NMA HSCT in adults with severe SCD further delineated its feasibility, potential toxicities, and fertility outcomes. GF remains a major impediment and appears dependent on ABO matching and non-ABO antibodies.

31503331	Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction associated with anti-Mta : case report and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Mta (MNS14) is a low-prevalence antigen of the MNS system. A few cases of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn caused by anti-Mta have been reported in the literature, but up to now this antibody has never been associated with a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR). CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old male with sickle cell disease undergoing exchange transfusion presented with shivering, nausea, dyspnea, and pain in the lower limbs. Biologic parameters showed increased hemolysis. The administered red blood cell (RBC) units had been issued by electronic crossmatch due to a negative antibody screening test. In the posttransfusion investigations, crossmatch of the transfused RBC units with the patient's serum showed incompatibility of one unit. The presence of an antibody against a low-prevalence antigen was suspected and further serologic testing was performed for identification. RESULTS: Anti-Mta was identified in the patient's serum. The RBCs of the incompatible unit implicated in the HTR were Mt(a+). An eluate of a posttransfusion blood sample of the patient was nonreactive with the incompatible RBCs, and the direct antiglobulin test was negative. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an HTR associated with anti-Mta .
28432164	Use of gabapentin in the treatment of chronic pain in an adolescent with sickle cell disease.	Vaso-occlusive crises are the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD) and the main cause of hospital admission in these patients. There is emerging evidence that vaso-occlusive pain has both nociceptive and neuropathic components. However, the treatment of SCD-related pain with neuropathic drugs has not yet been systematically studied, particularly in children. We describe a 14-year-old girl with SCD and multiple hospital admissions for pain management for severe acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of specialists which considered that the chronic, refractory pain she was experiencing for years was probably neuropathic in origin and it was decided to start oral gabapentin (300 mg/day). At 10 months follow-up, the patient reported remarkable improvement in her quality of life with a significant decrease in the number of hospital admissions (three admissions for acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes in 10 months versus the previously monthly recurrences).
30095751	How Sickle Cell Disease Impairs Skeletal Muscle Function: Implications in Daily Life.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent life-threatening genetic hemoglobinopathy in the world and occurs due to the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). hemoglobin S-containing red blood cells (RBC) are fragile, leading to hemolysis and anemia, and adhere to the endothelium, leading to hemorheological and hemodynamical disturbances. In its deoxygenated form, HbS may polymerize, leading to sickling of red blood cells and potentially to vasoocclusive crises. Recent findings observed that SCD patients demonstrate significant skeletal muscle remodeling and display reduced muscle functional capacities, contributing to exercise intolerance and poor quality of life. Although acute high-intensity exercise is not recommended for SCD patients because it may increase the risk of sickling, regular moderate-intensity physical activity could have beneficial effects on skeletal muscle and more generally on the well-being of SCD patients. This article reviews the literature regarding the impact of the disease on muscular tissue characteristics and function, as well as the corresponding implications for SCD patients' quality of life.
28698351	Subdissociative intranasal ketamine plus standard pain therapy versus standard pain therapy in the treatment of paediatric sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crises in resource-limited settings: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.	INTRODUCTION: Pediatric sickle cell disease, highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, carries great morbidity and mortality risk. Limited resources and monitoring make management of acute vaso-occlusive crises challenging. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subdissociative intranasal ketamine as a cheap, readily available and easily administered adjunct to standard pain therapy. We hypothesise that subdissociative, intranasal ketamine may significantly augment current approaches to pain management in resource-limited settings in a safe and cost-effective manner. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentred, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling children 4-16 years of age with sickle cell disease and painful vaso-occlusive pain crises. Study sites include two sub-Saharan teaching and referral hospitals with acute intake areas. All patients receive standard analgesic therapy during evaluation. Patients randomised to the treatment arm receive 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine at onset of therapy, while placebo arm participants receive volume-matched intranasal normal saline. All participants and clinical staff are blinded to the treatment allocation. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary endpoints are changes in self-report pain scales (Faces Pain Scale-Revised) at 30, 60 and 120 minutes and rates of adverse events. Secondary endpoints include hospital length of stay, total analgesia use and quality of life assessment 2-3 weeks postintervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research methods for this study have been approved by the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board Institutional Review Board (IRB2015-07), the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/2299), Muhimbili National Hospital IRB (MNH/IRB/I/2015/14) and the Tanzanian Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA0015/CTR/0015/9). Data reports will be provided to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) periodically throughout the study as well as all reports of adverse events. All protocol amendments will also be reviewed by the DSMB. Study results, regardless of direction or amplitude, will be submitted for publication in relevant peer-reviewed journals.

31167999	[Successful management of acute chest syndrome in a patient with sickle cell disease].	Although sickle cell disease (SCD) is common in endemic areas of malaria, it is one of the rare diseases in Japan. Hence, SCD and its complications are not well established in Japan. An 11-year-old girl was referred to the specialized pediatric center of our hospital. She was born in Brazil and diagnosed with SCD after birth. However, she did not have a routine checkup in Japan. Owing to influenza viral infection, she developed vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VPC) and needed hospitalization for pain management. After admission, she developed dyspnea, needing intratracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltration, suggesting acute chest syndrome (ACS) complicated with SCD. Intensive care, including transfusion of red blood cells, successfully improved her condition. Reportedly, half cases of VPC develop ACS, and the mortality of ACS is very high. Hence, when managing VPC cases, the prevention of ACS, through transfusion of red blood cells or infectious control, is imperative. Thus, Japanese hematologists and pediatricians should recognize SCD and its complications owing to an anticipated increase of foreign travelers or migrants in the future.
30076112	Pain Management Issues as Part of the Comprehensive Care of Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive pain crisis is one of the primary complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and is responsible for the majority of hospital visits in patients with SCD. Stints of severe pain can last for hours to days and are difficult to treat and manage, often resulting in drastically reduced quality of life. PURPOSE: Our purpose is to provide an overview of pain management issues in SCD populations. METHODS: We explored literature using PubMed and Embase for the etiology and management of pain in SCD. Databases were searched employing the following terms: sickle cell, pain pathways, pain perception, pharmacological therapies, psychological therapies, physical therapies and genetics. RESULTS: Pain in SCD can vary from acute to chronic (persistent) or mixed and understanding of the underlying mechanisms is important for proper pain management. Currently, there are many means of managing pain in children with SCD, which involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. A combination of psychotherapy and pain medications can be used for treatment of pain and other psychosocial co-morbidities in complex persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: Providing more appropriate medication and optimal dosage based on individual's genomic variations is the future of medicine, and this will allow the physicians to hone in on optimal pain management in patients with SCD.
36708354	Iron chelation therapy.	Iron overload is a pathological condition resulting from a congenital impairment of its regulation, increased intestinal iron absorption secondary to bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, or a chronic transfusional regimen. In normal conditions, intracellular and systemic mechanisms contribute to maintaining iron balance. When this complex homeostatic mechanism fails, an iron overload could be present. Detecting an iron overload is not easy. The gold standard remains the liver biopsy, even if it is invasive and dangerous. Identifying iron using noninvasive techniques allowed a better understanding of the rate of iron overload in different organs, with a low risk for the patient. Estimating serum ferritin (mg/L) is the easiest and, consequently, the most employed diagnostic tool for assessing body iron stores, even if it could be a not specific method. The most common hematological causes of iron overload are myelodysplastic syndromes, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. In all of these conditions, three drugs have been approved for the treatment of iron overload: deferiprone, deferoxamine, and deferasirox. These chelators have been demonstrated to help lower tissue iron levels and prevent iron overload complications, improving event-free survival (EFS). Nowadays, the decision to start chelation and which chelator to choose remains the joint decision of the clinician and patient.

29187376	Targeting novel mechanisms of pain in sickle cell disease.	"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from intense pain that can start during infancy and increase in severity throughout life, leading to hospitalization and poor quality of life. A unique feature of SCD is vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) characterized by episodic, recurrent, and unpredictable episodes of acute pain. Microvascular obstruction during a VOC leads to impaired oxygen supply to the periphery and ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which may perpetuate a noxious microenvironment leading to pain. In addition to episodic acute pain, patients with SCD also report chronic pain. Current treatment of moderate to severe pain in SCD is mostly reliant upon opioids; however, long-term use of opioids is associated with multiple side effects. This review presents up-to-date developments in our understanding of the pathobiology of pain in SCD. To help focus future research efforts, major gaps in knowledge are identified regarding how sickle pathobiology evokes pain, pathways specific to chronic and acute sickle pain, perception-based targets of ""top-down"" mechanisms originating from the brain and neuromodulation, and how pain affects the sickle microenvironment and pathophysiology. This review also describes mechanism-based targets that may help develop novel therapeutic and/or preventive strategies to ameliorate pain in SCD."

32040047	Clinical Impact of Warmed Intravenous Saline in Sickle Cell Patients With Vasoocclusive Episodes.	OBJECTIVES: In children with sickle cell disease treated for vasoocclusive episodes (VOEs), it is unknown if the temperature of infused fluids impacts clinical outcomes. We compared infusions of warmed and nonwarmed saline for treatment of VOE. We also assessed the tolerability and feasibility of infusing warmed saline in patients with VOEs. METHODS: Patients aged 4 to 21 years with sickle cell disease presenting to the emergency department with VOE were randomized to infusions of warmed (37.5 C, experimental arm) versus nonwarmed (22 C-24 C, controls) saline. Intravenous opioids were administered according to previously established guidelines. We compared hospital admission rates, pain scores, disposition times, dosages of opioid, and comfort. RESULTS: Eighty of 92 visits were eligible (40 per arm). The mean age of enrollees was 14 years, and 53% were female. Hospital admission rates were comparable (63% experimental arm and 55% control arm, P = 0.5). Pain score reduction (-2.9 and -2.6, P = 0.52), median morphine equivalents (0.23 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, P = 0.58), and mean treatment-to-disposition times (158 minutes and 155 minutes, P = 0.85) were also similar. Global comfort was higher in children who received warmed saline (4 vs 3, P = 0.01). There were no adverse events reported in patients who received warmed saline. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and tolerable to infuse warmed saline for the treatment of VOE, and it is well tolerated. Patient comfort was higher in those patients who received warmed saline, but there was no improvement in admission rates, disposition times, pain scores, and opioid dosages.
29127679	Alternative Donor/Unrelated Donor Transplants for the beta-Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease.	Considerable progress with respect to donor source has been achieved in allogeneic stem cell transplant for patients with hemoglobin disorders, with matched sibling donors in the 1980s, matched unrelated donors and cord blood sources in the 1990s, and haploidentical donors in the 2000s. Many studies have solidified hematopoietic progenitors from matched sibling marrow, cord blood, or mobilized peripheral blood as the best source-with the lowest graft rejection and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and highest disease-free survival rates. For patients without HLA-matched sibling donors, but who are otherwise eligible for transplant, fully allelic matched unrelated donor (8/8 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1) appears to be the next best option, though an ongoing study in patients with sickle cell disease will provide data that are currently lacking. There are high GvHD rates and low engraftment rates in some of the unrelated cord transplant studies. Haploidentical donors have emerged in the last decade to have less GvHD; however, improvements are needed to increase the engraftment rate. Thus the decision to use unrelated cord blood units or haploidentical donors may depend on the institutional expertise; there is no clear preferred choice over the other. Active research is ongoing in expanding cord blood progenitor cells to overcome the limitation of cell dose, including the options of small molecule inhibitor compounds added to ex vivo culture or co-culture with supportive cell lines. There are inconsistent data from using 7/8 or lower matched unrelated donors. Before routine use of these less matched donor sources, work is needed to improve patient selection, conditioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis, and/or other strategies.
33485798	Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States alone. SCD can cause numerous complications, including anemia, pain, stroke, and organ failure, which can lead to death. Although there are a few disease-modifying treatments available to patients with SCD, the only current curative option is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In this review, we will discuss the different approaches to allogeneic HSCT in the treatment of SCD and the outcomes of these approaches.
32672896	Stable renal function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with renal complications starting as early as infancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) treatments using newer nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens show promising results in treating SCD in the pediatric population, but renal outcome parameters after transplantation have not been described. AIM: To describe baseline renal parameters as well as short- and long-term renal outcomes in pediatric patients with SCD who underwent NMA-HSCT. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who received NMA-HSCT in Alberta, Canada. Short-term renal outcomes evaluated were: (1) acute kidney injury (AKI), (2) fluid overload (FO), and (3) hypertension. Long-term outcomes evaluated were: (1) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) development and at last follow-up with hyperfiltration defined as eGFR >= 150 mL/min/1.73 m2 , (2) proteinuria, and (3) hypertension. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 128.6 weeks (standard deviations, 69.3). No posttransplant AKI events or FO were observed. eGFR remained > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at last follow-up in all patients, whereas hyperfiltration was present in eight (44.4%) and four (22.2%) patients pre- and post-HSCT, respectively, which are significantly different (P < 0.0001). Consequently, median GFR was significantly higher pre-HSCT compared with 24 months HSCT (P < 0.009). Long-term hypertension post-HSCT was present in six patients (33.3%). CONCLUSION: This study describes stable kidney function in children with SCD after NMA-HSCT without evidence of AKI or FO episodes. Rates of hyperfiltration decreased post-HSCT, which signifies that NMA-HSCT could potentially preserve long-term renal function in this population at risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these novel findings.

29313505	Effectiveness, safety, and cost of partial exchange transfusions in patients with sickle-cell anemia at a sickle cell disease center in sub-Saharan Africa.	The partial exchange transfusions necessary for management of some sickle-cell complications raise the issue of effectiveness in the context of limited resources and inadequate blood safety. This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and cost of partial exchange transfusions in 39 patients with sickle-cell anemia in Lubumbashi, looking at the patients' age and gender and the tolerability and direct cost of the transfusions. Excel and SPSS 18 were used for data entry and analysis. Chi2 and Fisher exact tests were used for comparisons. A P-value <= 5% was considered statistically significant. The average age of patients was 8.6 +- 6.4 years, and the majority were girls. The most frequent indications were stroke, severe infections, severe vasooclusive crises, and acute chest syndrome. Partial exchange transfusions were effective in improving hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as the percentage of HbS. No acute accident was observed during any partial exchange transfusion; one anti-Kell alloimmunization and 2 cases of iron overload were observed. The annual cost of partial exchange transfusions per patient requiring (and able to afford) regular treatment was US $ 3,345 without iron chelation and more than US $ 5000 with chelation. Partial exchange transfusions are effective and tolerated, but financially inaccessible to the majority of our sickle cell patients. Thus, an assessment is needed of the economic burden of sickle cell complications that require partial exchange transfusions in the context of countries with limited financial resources.

30431560	Brief topical sodium nitrite and its impact on the quality of life in patients with sickle leg ulcers.	Cutaneous ulceration from sickle cell disease negatively impacts quality of life. Topical sodium nitrite has previously been shown to reduce the size of sickle leg ulcers. This study examined how topical sodium nitrite impacted the quality of life scores in patients with sickle leg ulcers.We prospectively collected data in patients enrolled in a leg ulcer study (n = 17) or an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant study (nonulcer group, n = 15). Both groups completed a pretreatment Short Form-36 questionnaire; the ulcer group completed a second questionnaire after 4 weeks of topical sodium nitrite applications. Data were analyzed by age, sex, >50% area improvement postintervention, and sickle-related complications (vaso-occlusive crises, pulmonary hypertension, or avascular necrosis). Physical and mental component summary scores were analyzed with Student t test.Physical summary scores were lower than mental summary scores in all groups, indicating leg ulcers among other sickle related complications negatively impacted physical quality of life measures. After sodium nitrite use, physical summary scores improved in the leg ulcer group (34.5 +- 9.4 to 39 +- 10.3, P = .03), and mental summary scores improved more in ulcerated patients <=35 years old (40.7 +- 6.9 to 51.7 +- 9.7, P = .01).Brief topical sodium nitrite has the potential to improve quality of life, especially in younger individuals. Longer treatment duration and randomized-controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of this topical therapy.
29127678	Allogeneic/Matched Related Transplantation for beta-Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure single gene disorders such as thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA). These non-malignant diseases have in common severe hemolytic anemia and high proliferative bone marrow, requiring frequent transfusions. The risk of rejection is high and graft-vs-host disease is not desirable. Important progress has been made in the management of these diseases, including leukocyte depletion of blood products, and chelation therapy, for both diseases, and erythrocytapheresis and hydroxycarbamide for SCA. However, morbidity and quality of life are still of concern. Results have also significantly improved for HSCT, with the reduction of rejection by using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which also decreases the risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease. Current data show a more than 90% chance of cure with myeloablative conditioning in children with hemoglobinopathy and a geno-identical donor. Results are similar whether the cell source is cord blood or bone marrow. Because of the risk of conditioning-related infertility, ovarian and/or testis cryopreservation should be discussed. Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens have also been successfully developed in adults with SCA and organ dysfunction, making cure possible. These encouraging results should incite to perform HLA typing early in families with hemoglobinopathies, and to systematically propose sibling cord blood cryopreservation for those without geno-identical donor.
28821470	Design of the DREPAGREFFE trial: A prospective controlled multicenter study evaluating the benefit of genoidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation over chronic transfusion in sickle cell anemia children detected to be at risk of stroke by transcranial Doppler (NCT 01340404).	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have an 11% risk of stroke by the age of 18. Chronic transfusion applied in patients detected to be at risk by transcranial Doppler allows a significant reduction of stroke risk. However, chronic transfusion exposes to several adverse events, including alloimmunization and iron overload, and is not curative. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allows termination of the transfusion program, but its benefit has not been demonstrated. DESIGN: DREPAGREFFE (NCT01340404) is a multicenter, prospective trial enrolling SCA children younger than 15years receiving chronic transfusion due to a history of abnormal transcranial Doppler (velocities >=200cm/s). Only those with at least one non-SCA sibling and parents accepting HLA-typing and transplantation with a genoidentical donor were eligible. Chronic transfusion was pursued in patients with no available donor, whereas others were transplanted. Comparison between the 2 arms (transfusion vs transplantation) was analyzed using both genetic randomization and propensity-score matching as a sensitivity analysis. The primary end-point was the velocity measure at 1year. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and stenoses, cognitive performance in comparison with siblings, allo-immunization, iron-overload, phosphatidyl-serine, angiogenesis/hypoxia, brain injury-related factor expression, quality of life and cost. OBJECTIVES: To show that genoidentical transplantation decreases velocities significantly more than chronic transfusion in SCA children at risk of stroke. DISCUSSION: DREPAGREFFE is the first prospective study to evaluate transplantation in SCA children. It compares the outcome of cerebral vasculopathy following genoidentical transplantation versus chronic transfusion using genetic randomization and causal inference methods.

30198607	Red blood cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease-indications and management: a review and consensus report by the therapeutic apheresis subsection of the AABB.	BACKGROUND: A prior practice survey revealed variations in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and stressed the need for comprehensive guidelines. Here we discuss: 1) common indications for red blood cell exchange (RCE), 2) options for access, 3) how to prepare the red blood cells (RBCs) to be used for RCE, 4) target hemoglobin (Hb) and/or hematocrit (Hct) and HbS level, 5) RBC depletion/RCE, and 6) some complications that may ensue. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen physicians actively practicing apheresis from 14 institutions representing different areas within the United States discussed how they manage RCE for patients with SCD. RESULTS: Simple transfusion is recommended to treat symptomatic anemia with Hb level of less than 9 g/dL. RCE is indicated to prevent or treat complications arising from the presence of HbS. The most important goals are reduction of HbS while also preventing hyperviscosity. The usual goals are a target HbS level of not more than 30% and Hct level of less than 30%. CONCLUSION: Although a consensus as to protocol details may not be possible, there are areas of agreement in the management of these patients, for example, that it is optimal to avoid hyperviscosity and iron overload, that a target Hb S level in the range of 30% is generally desirable, and that RCE as an acute treatment for pain crisis in the absence of other acute or chronic conditions is ordinarily discouraged.
33788404	A systematic review of ketamine for the management of vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and a significant cause of morbidity. Managing VOE pain can be difficult and complex. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been used to manage VOE pain. This systematic literature review synthesizes research published from 2010 to 2020 on the use of ketamine infusion to decrease VOE pain. The review demonstrates that ketamine, a safe and effective treatment for VOE pain, could be considered more widely. However, the significant variability among published clinical studies with regard to dosing, timing of initiation, duration of infusion, and timing of discontinuation highlights the need for standardized ketamine infusion protocols for the management of VOE pain. We conclude with a brief discussion of key components of a potential standardized protocol supported by the literature reviewed as well as areas for future investigation.
37731093	A Comparison of the effect of patient-specific vs. weight-based protocols to treat vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in the emergency department.	BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) cause debilitating pain and are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Strategies for achieving optimal pain control vary widely despite evidence-based guidelines. We tested existing guidelines and hypothesized a patient-specific protocol (PSP) written by their SCD provider, may be more effective than weight-based (WB) dosing of parenteral opiate medication, in relieving pain. METHODS: Prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a PSP versus WB protocol for patients presenting with VOC to six EDs. Patients were randomized to a PSP or WB protocol prior to an ED visit. SCD provider wrote their protocol and placed in the electronic health record for future ED visits with a VOC Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing PSP excluding parenteral opioid analgesia or out-patient use of buprenorphine or methadone, or highly suspected for COVID-19. Pain intensity scores, side effects and safety were obtained every 30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-ED bed placement. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity score from placement in an ED space to disposition or six hours. RESULTS: 328 subjects were randomized, 104 participants enrolled (ED visit, target n=230) with complete data for 96 visits. The study was unable to reach the target sample size and stopped early due to the impact of COVID-19. We found no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome; patients randomized to a PSP had a shorter ED length of stay (p=.008); the prevalence of side effects was low in both groups. Subjects in both groups experienced both a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in pain (27 mm on a 0-100 mm scale) CONCLUSIONS: We found a shorter ED length of stay for patients assigned to a PSP. Patients in both groups experienced good pain relief without significant side effects.
33534136	Hydroyxurea improves cerebral oxygen saturation in children with sickle cell anemia.	Neurologic complications are common in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but conventional tools such as MRI and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) do not fully assess cerebrovascular pathology. Cerebral tissue oximetry measures mixed oxygen saturation in the frontal lobes (SCT O2 ) and provides early prognostic information about tissue at risk of ischemic injury. Untreated patients with SCA have significantly lower SCT O2 than healthy controls that declines with age. Hydroxyurea is effective in preventing many SCA-related complications, but the degree to which it preserves normal neurophysiology is unclear. We analyzed participants enrolled in the Therapeutic Response Evaluation and Adherence Trial (TREAT, NCT02286154), which enrolled participants initiating hydroxyurea using individualized dosing (new cohort) and those previously taking hydroxyurea (old cohort) and was designed to monitor the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea. Cerebral oximetry was performed at baseline and annually. For the new cohort (median starting age = 12 months, n = 55), mean baseline SCT O2 was normal before starting hydroxyurea (mean 65%, 95% CI 58-72%) and significantly increased after 2 years (mean 72%, 95% CI 65-79%, p < .001). The SCT O2 for patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea (median age = 9.6 years) was normal at study entry (mean 66%, 95% CI 58-74%) and remained stable across 2 years. Both cohorts had significantly higher SCT O2 than published data from predominantly untreated SCA patients. Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method to assess cerebrovascular pathology that complements conventional imaging. Our results indicate that hydroxyurea suggests protection against neurophysiologic changes seen in untreated SCA.
29525569	Use of red blood cell exchange for treating acute complications of sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening chronic condition primarily caused by genetic mutation. The disease is characterized by intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic hemolytic anemia. Acute complications in patients with SCD are difficult to manage due to the pathophysiological nature of the disease. Transfusion therapy is the cornerstone of management of acute complications and significantly reduces SCD morbidity and mortality. Red cell exchange (RCE), which is characterized by low iron accumulation and volume overload, has been widely used for transfusion therapy in recent years.
29614631	Simple chronic transfusion therapy, a crucial therapeutic option for sickle cell disease, improves but does not normalize blood rheology: What should be our goals for transfusion therapy?	Sickle cell anemia is characterized by a mutation resulting in the formation of an abnormal beta-hemoglobin called hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S polymerizes upon deoxygenation, causing impaired red blood cell deformability and increased blood viscosity at equivalent hematocrits. Thus, sickle cell disease is a hemorheologic disease that results in various pathologic processes involving multiple organ systems including the lungs, heart, kidneys and brain. Red blood cell mechanics and the perturbations on blood flow-endothelial interaction underlie much of the pathology found in sickle cell disease. Transfusion therapy is one of the few therapeutic options available to patients, acting as both primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Transfusion therapy, both simple and exchange, is also used for unremitting and frequent pain crises and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, understanding basic rheologic changes following transfusion inform other therapeutic options that aim to mitigate this diffuse pathologic process. This review will aim to highlight transfusion effects on blood rheology.
36510393	Clinical Delivery and Effectiveness of Music Therapy in Hematology and Oncology: An EMMPIRE Retrospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and patients with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc) in prior randomized trials. While few studies have described the clinical delivery (ie, volume, clinical settings, patient characteristics, referrals, and session characteristics) of MT and examined its real-world effectiveness, no studies have compared responses between hematology/oncology populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical delivery and effectiveness of MT at a freestanding academic cancer center and compare the effectiveness of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue between adult patients in the HemOnc and SCD groups. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all MT sessions provided at a freestanding academic cancer center between January 2017 and July 2020. The unadjusted single-session effects of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed among patients reporting symptoms >=1 out of 10 on a 0 to 10 scale. Adjustments were made for multiple sessions on the same patient using a mixed model to compare pre-session and change scores between the HemOnc and SCD groups. Patients' comments were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Music therapists provided 4002 sessions to 1152 patients including 1012 in the HemOnc group and 140 in the SCD group. In the combined sample, statistically significant reductions in pain (1.48 units), anxiety (2.58 units), and fatigue (0.84 units) were observed, with changes in pain and anxiety exceeding clinically significant thresholds. After adjustment, the SCD group reported significantly greater pre-session pain (7.22 vs 5.81) and anxiety (6.11 vs 5.17) as well as greater anxiety reduction (2.89 vs 2.23) than the HemOnc group. Patients' comments contained themes including enjoyment, gratitude, and improvements in mood, pain, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the delivery and clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing the needs of patients throughout their course of treatment at an academic cancer center and justifies the inclusion of individuals with SCD within integrative oncology services.
31451364	Randomized clinical trial of computerized PAINRelieveIt  for patients with sickle cell disease: PAINReportIt  and PAINUCope .	OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of a tailored multimedia education program versus usual-care on barriers to pain management of adult patients with SCD. METHODS: Pretest/posttest randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 228 outpatients with SCD randomized to the tablet-based PAINUCope intervention focused on barriers to pain management, pain, and analgesic adherence or selection of games (control). Outcomes were barriers to pain management, pain, and analgesic adherence. RESULTS: The barriers to pain management and pain scores did not change significantly from pretest to posttest for either condition. Changes in analgesic adherence rates from pretest to posttest were statistically significant for the intervention group (p = .046) but not for the usual care group (p = .419). The group difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This first RCT of a tailored multimedia education intervention with adult patients with SCD did not significantly reduce the outcomes of interest compared to the control group. Findings provide insights for improving intervention delivery and reinforcement of patient behaviors. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Study redesign is warranted with modifications that include theoretical and methodological approaches and patient-centered delivery of the intervention that take advantage of recent technology developments.
29447888	Pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients affected by beta-thalassemia major and sickle cell anaemia post allogenic bone marrow transplant.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) and beta -thalassemia major are well-recognized beta-globin gene disorders of red blood cells associated to mortality and morbidity included bone morbidities due to ineffective erythropoiesis and bone marrow expansion, which affect every part of the skeleton. While there are an abundance of described disease manifestations of the head and neck, the manner of paranasal sinuses involvement and its relations to beta-thalassemia and SCA process was not studied yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate a possible increased risk of rhinosinusitis and the real pathogenetic mechanism of it, comparing these two hematological diseases using msCT, gold standard for paranasal sinuses evaluation. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 90 patients affected by beta-thalassemia major or SCA (respectively 59 and 31) underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 44 control subjects was performed. Both patient categories and control group have been subjected to hematological and radiological evaluation using 64-multidetector-row CT scanner without contrast injection. RESULTS: Statistical analysis reveals that patients of the two study groups exhibit a significantly increased risk of sinusitis in comparison with the normal controls (RR: 3.55 for beta-thalassemic pediatric subjects; RR: 3.35 for SCA pediatric subjects). A significant difference (p < 0,5) was found between the beta -thalassemic patients on the one side, and SCA and control group on the other side, with regard to the evaluation of the typical anatomic alteration of maxillary sinus: beta-thalassemic children had significant increase in the bone thickness of anterior and lateral sinus walls and significant reduction in volume and density compared to SCA patients and control group, with normal conditions of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In these hematological patients, there is an increased incidence of sinonasal infections due their therapy-induced immunosuppression post transplantation. In beta-thalassemic patients, furthermore, the specific anatomical variants play an important confounding factor in radiological interpretation of CT images. Therefore, a cranio-facial CT scan evaluation could be a useful tool in the management of upper airway infections after BMT and should be a routinely exams in order to avoid useless surgical or antibiotic approaches.
36883373	Emergency red cell exchange for the management of acute complications in sickle cell disease: Automated versus manual.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is the cornerstone of the management for acute complications of sickle cell disease. It improves anaemia and improvesperipheral tissue oxygen delivery while at the same time reduces the proportion of circulating sickle erythrocytes. Even though automated red cell exchange is very effective in rapidly lowering the Hb S level, 24-h availability is currently not feasible for most specialist centres including our own. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe our experience using both automated and manual red cell exchange for the management of acute sickle cell complications. METHODS: Eighty-six such episodes have been recorded between June 2011 and June 2022 comprising of 68 episodes of automated and 18 episodes of manual red cell exchange. RESULTS: The post procedure Hb S/S + C level was 18% after automated and 36% after manual red cell exchange. The platelet count dropped by 41% and 21% after automated and manual red cell exchange respectively. The clinical outcomes including need for organ support, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and overall length of hospitalisation was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In our experience, manual red cell exchange is a safe and effective alternative to an automated procedure that can be used while specialist centres are building up their capacity to offer automated red cell exchange for all patients requiring the intervention.
32403134	Combination dose-escalated hydroxyurea and transfusion: an approach to conserve blood during the COVID-19 pandemic.	
29222301	Optimizing the care model for an uncomplicated acute pain episode in sickle cell disease.	The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and natural history of acute pain in sickle cell disease are unique and require a disease-centered approach that also applies general principles of acute and chronic pain management. The majority of acute pain episodes are managed at home without the need to access health care. The long-term consequences of poorly treated acute pain include chronic pain, adverse effects of chronic opioid usage, psychological maladjustment, poor quality of life, and excessive health care utilization. There is no standard protocol for management of an acute pain crisis in either the hospital or the community. The assumptions that severe acute pain must be managed in the hospital with parenteral opioids and that strong opioids are needed for home management of pain need to be questioned. Pain management in the emergency department often does not meet acceptable standards, while chronic use of strong opioids is likely to result in opioid-induced hyperalgesia, exacerbation of chronic pain symptoms, and opioid dependency. We suggest that an integrated approach is needed to control the underlying condition, modify psychological responses, optimize social support, and ensure that health care services provide safe, effective, and prompt treatment of acute pain and appropriate management of chronic pain. This integrated approach should begin at an early age and continue through the adolescent, transition, and adult phases of the care model.
28439953	Feasibility trial for primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia in Nigeria (SPIN trial).	The vast majority of children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) live in Africa, where evidence-based guidelines for primary stroke prevention are lacking. In Kano, Nigeria, we conducted a feasibility trial to determine the acceptability of hydroxyurea therapy for primary stroke prevention in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements. Children with SCA and abnormal non-imaging TCD measurements (>=200 cm/s) received moderate fixed-dose hydroxyurea therapy (~20 mg/kg/day). A comparison group of children with TCD measurements <200 cm/s was followed prospectively. Approximately 88% (330 of 375) of families agreed to be screened, while 87% (29 of 33) of those with abnormal TCD measurements, enrolled in the trial. No participant elected to withdraw from the trial. The average mean corpuscular volume increased from 85.7 fl at baseline to 95.5 fl at 24 months (not all of the children who crossed over had a 24 month visit), demonstrating adherence to hydroxyurea. The comparison group consisted of initially 210 children, of which four developed abnormal TCD measurements, and were started on hydroxyurea. None of the monthly research visits were missed (n = total 603 visits). Two and 10 deaths occurred in the treatment and comparison groups, with mortality rates of 2.69 and 1.81 per 100 patient-years, respectively (P = .67). Our results provide strong evidence, for high family recruitment, retention, and adherence rates, to undertake the first randomized controlled trial with hydroxyurea therapy for primary stroke prevention in children with SCA living in Africa.
29653206	Late Effects Screening Guidelines after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) for Hemoglobinopathy: Consensus Statement from the Second Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium International Conference on Late Effects after Pediatric HCT.	"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can halt organ damage and eliminate symptoms in hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia major. Managing the residual manifestations of pre-HCT disease complications and the long-term effects of HCT requires systematic monitoring, follow-up and intervention when indicated. Late complications vary with age and disease status at HCT and with transplant variables such as preparative regimen, donor source and compatibility, and immune reconstitution. An international consensus conference sponsored by the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium in May 2016 entitled ""Late Effects Screening and Recommendations Following HCT for Immune Deficiency and Nonmalignant Hematologic Disorders"" focused on follow-up after HCT for hemoglobinopathy. An earlier publication from experts who participated in this session described the pathophysiology and spectrum of complications that HCT recipients experience after HCT for SCD and thalassemia major. This companion publication summarizes the consensus reached by this group of experts about long-term follow-up guidelines after HCT for hemoglobinopathy. In addition, these guidelines might also be included in studies of novel curative therapies such as autologous HCT after hematopoietic progenitor stem cell gene modification."
36064527	Adverse events of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.	Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and disease related complications. While patients with SCD are at risk for all transfusion related adverse events defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Biovigilance Component Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol, they are uniquely susceptible to certain adverse events. This review discusses risk factors, mitigation strategies, and management recommendations for alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions, hyperviscosity and transfusion-associated iron overload in the context of SCD.
33177052	Clinical management of sickle cell liver disease in children and young adults.	Liver involvement in sickle cell disease (SCD) is often referred to as sickle cell hepatopathy (SCH) and is a complication of SCD which may be associated with significant mortality. This review is based on a round-table workshop between paediatric and adult hepatologists and haematologists and review of the literature. The discussion was prompted by the lack of substantial data and guidance in managing these sometimes very challenging cases. This review provides a structured approach for the diagnosis and management of SCH in children and young adults. The term SCH describes any hepatobiliary dysfunction in the context of SCD. Diagnosis and management of biliary complications, acute hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration and other manifestations of SCH are discussed, as well as the role of liver transplantation and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in the management of SCH.
29773497	Indications for red cell transfusions in pediatric patients.	Red cell transfusions are amongst the most common therapeutic procedures in seriously ill children, particularly in the inpatient setting. This is despite the fact that there is no evidence base for most clinical settings, with the exception of patients with hemoglobinopathies, particularly thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Obviously exsanguinating hemorrhage and life threatening anemia are urgent indications for which no other therapeutic approach is currently available. Most transfusions are, however, given prophylactically to prevent the complications of hypoxia or hemodynamic stability, based upon expert opinion and a faith in the oxygen carrying capacity and beneficial hemodynamic properties of transfused red cells. The question confronting current day pediatric practice is to what extent transfused red cells prevent adverse events, other than in thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, as opposed to causing them. Do transfusions of red cells prevent organ failure, stroke, etc. or not? There is epidemiologic evidence in the adult randomized trial literature that liberal red cell transfusion likely causes more such adverse events than it prevents. The relevance of such studies to children, particularly neonates, is uncertain. Randomized trials in critically ill neonates have yielded little to no evidence that liberal red cell transfusion is beneficial, but the data are not definitive. In critically ill older children the data suggest there is no benefit to liberal red cell transfusion, but the indications for red cell transfusion are uncertain. Most practitioners would agree that combining laboratory data such hemoglobin/hematocrit with clinical indications for transfusions (evidence of end organ hypoxia such as tachycardia, shortness of breath, etc.) is the only viable strategy at present, until more definitive randomized trial data are available.
33283990	Post-Transcriptional Genetic Silencing of BCL11A to Treat Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF) comprising alpha- and gamma-globins may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of gamma-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for induction of HbF. METHODS: We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR), allowing erythroid lineage-specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary end points of engraftment and safety and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment. RESULTS: As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy; median follow-up was 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates BCL11A inhibition as an effective target for HbF induction and provides preliminary evidence that shmiR-based gene knockdown offers a favorable risk-benefit profile in sickle cell disease.

32201153	Alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in Europe.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is, to date, the only curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Because an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor is not always available, alternative stem cell sources such as unrelated or haploidentical related donors have been explored. To date, few series of SCD patients transplanted with an unrelated donor, cord blood, and haploidentical related donor have been reported, but the high rates of rejection and chronic graft versus host disease have limited their widespread application. We describe the outcomes of a retrospective, registry-based, survey on 144 alternative donor HSCT performed for SCD in 30 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers between 1999 and 2017. Data on 70 unrelated adult donors (49%), six cord blood (4%), and 68 haploidentical donors (47%; including post-HSCT Cy, ex vivo T-cell depleted, and other haplo-HSCTs) were reported and missing information was updated by the centers. Overall, 16% patients experienced graft failure, Grade II-IV acute GVHD at 100 days was 24%, whereas Grade III-IV was 10%. Chronic GVHD was observed in 24% (limited for 13 patients and extensive for 18 patients). Overall, the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 86% +- 3% and 3-year event-free survival (EFS; considering death and graft failure as events) was 72% +- 4%. We therefore conclude that alternative donor HSCT for SCD can be feasible but efforts in decreasing relapse and GVHD should be promoted to increase its safe and successful utilization. Moreover, a better knowledge of HLA matching and the tailoring of conditioning could help improve EFS and OS.
37979134	How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy.	50 years ago, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.

30772511	Nonmyeloablative Matched Sibling Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Children and Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is a potentially debilitating hemoglobinopathy associated with early mortality. The only established curative therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with a matched sibling donor. The National Institutes of Health nonmyeloablative regimen of alemtuzumab/300 cGy total body irradiation and prolonged sirolimus exposure for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered to 16 children and adolescents. Infused products were unmanipulated granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. All patients achieved mixed donor-recipient engraftment with no cases of secondary graft failure to date. Two patients have donor myeloid chimerism in the range of 30% to 40%. No sickling crises post-HCT have been observed. Event-free and overall survival rates are 100% with median follow-up of 19.5 months. No cases of GVHD have been observed. Sirolimus weaning was possible in all but one eligible patient to date. Ongoing follow-up and a larger prospective clinical trial are required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this regimen in children.
31880407	Haploidentical bone marrow transplantation in a patient with sickle cell disease and acute myeloid leukemia.	Myeloid neoplasms in children with sickle cell disease have been rarely reported, and the exact underlying connection between these two conditions is not clearly understood. Whether the acute myeloid leukemia in hydroxyurea-treated sickle cell patients is co-incidental or related to therapy remains an unanswered question. Herein, we report a 14-year-old girl of Haitian descent with sickle beta zero thalassemia on chronic hydroxyurea therapy who developed FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia and underwent a complete disease remission following a combination chemotherapy with sorafenib and was subsequently treated using a T cell replete unmanipulated haploidentical bone marrow transplantation followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide.
32617981	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder involving a defect in the red blood cells due to its sickled hemoglobin. The main therapeutic interventions include preventive and supportive measures. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are carried out with the aim of replacing the defective cells and their progenitors (hematopoietic (i.e. blood forming) stem cells) in order to correct the disorder. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether stem cell transplantation can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. To examine the risks of stem cell transplantation against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register complied from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library) and quarterly searches of MEDLINE. We also searched trial registries for ongoing trials up to April 2020. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 December 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled and quasi-randomized trials that compared any method of stem cell transplantation with either each other or with any of the preventive or supportive interventions (e.g. periodic blood transfusion, use of hydroxyurea, antibiotics, pain relievers, supplemental oxygen) in people with sickle cell disease irrespective of the type of sickle cell disease, gender and setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 potentially-eligible trials by the searches; we excluded 11 of these and the remaining trial is an ongoing trial that may be eligible for inclusion in a future version of the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Reports on the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation improving survival and preventing symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease are currently limited to observational and other less robust studies. We did not find any eligible randomized controlled trials assessing the benefit or risk of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations. However, there is an ongoing quasi-randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with standard care, Thus, this systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomized controlled trial assessing the benefits and possible risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations comparing sickle status and severity of disease in people with sickle cell disease.
34166998	Evidence for continued dose escalation of plerixafor for hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.	We present data from our study of plerixafor mobilization (NCT02193191) relevant to the question of whether further dose escalation of plerixafor can address inconsistent adequacy of CD34+ mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease (SCD). We found that, in the same patient, higher plerixafor dosing was associated with higher fold increases in PB CD34+ count, but not necessarily higher absolute CD34+ counts. Variation in pre-apheresis absolute CD34+ counts was related to intra-individual variation in baseline PB CD34+ counts and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to plerixafor. Overall, our results support further studies of continued dose escalation of plerixafor for autologous HPC collection in SCD.
31456233	Perioperative care of children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review and clinical recommendations.	"Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) require specific perioperative care, and clinical practice in this area remains poorly defined. We aimed to conduct a systematic, PRISMA-based review of the literature, available clinical guidelines and practice recommendations. We also aimed to extract any valuable information for the ""best of available-evidence""-based prevention of perioperative adverse events in children with SCD, and highlight the most urgent priorities in clinical research. As data sources, US National Library of Medicine, Medline, National Guideline Clearinghouse, International Guideline Network, TRIP databases were searched for any content until January 2019. We also included institutional, consortia and expert group guidelines. Included were reports/guidelines in English, French, German, and Italian. Excluded were reports on obstetrical and fetal management. We identified 202 reports/guidelines fulfilling the criteria outlined above. A majority focused on visceral, cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery procedures, and only five were multicenter randomized controlled trials and two prospective randomized studies. After grading of the quality of the evidence, the extracted data was summarized into clinical recommendations for daily practice. Additionally, we designed a risk-grading algorithm to identify contexts likely to be associated with adverse outcomes. In conclusion, we provide a systematic PRISMA-based review of the existing literature and ancillary practice and delineate a set of clinical recommendations and priorities for research."
37470933	Pediatric Moyamoya Revascularization Perioperative Care: A Modified Delphi Study.	BACKGROUND: Surgical revascularization decreases the long-term risk of stroke in children with moyamoya arteriopathy but can be associated with an increased risk of stroke during the perioperative period. Evidence-based approaches to optimize perioperative management are limited and practice varies widely. Using a modified Delphi process, we sought to establish expert consensus on key components of the perioperative care of children with moyamoya undergoing indirect revascularization surgery and identify areas of equipoise to define future research priorities. METHODS: Thirty neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists practicing in North America with expertise in the management of pediatric moyamoya were invited to participate in a three-round, modified Delphi process consisting of a 138-item practice patterns survey, anonymous electronic evaluation of 88 consensus statements on a 5-point Likert scale, and a virtual group meeting during which statements were discussed, revised, and reassessed. Consensus was defined as >= 80% agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Thirty-nine statements regarding perioperative pediatric moyamoya care for indirect revascularization surgery reached consensus. Salient areas of consensus included the following: (1) children at a high risk for stroke and those with sickle cell disease should be preadmitted prior to indirect revascularization; (2) intravenous isotonic fluids should be administered in all patients for at least 4 h before and 24 h after surgery; (3) aspirin should not be discontinued in the immediate preoperative and postoperative periods; (4) arterial lines for blood pressure monitoring should be continued for at least 24 h after surgery and until active interventions to achieve blood pressure goals are not needed; (5) postoperative care should include hourly vital signs for at least 24 h, hourly neurologic assessments for at least 12 h, adequate pain control, maintaining normoxia and normothermia, and avoiding hypotension; and (6) intravenous fluid bolus administration should be considered the first-line intervention for new focal neurologic deficits following indirect revascularization surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of data supporting specific care practices before and after indirect revascularization surgery in children with moyamoya, this Delphi process defined areas of consensus among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and intensivists with moyamoya expertise. Research priorities identified include determining the role of continuous electroencephalography in postoperative moyamoya care, optimal perioperative blood pressure and hemoglobin targets, and the role of supplemental oxygen for treatment of suspected postoperative ischemia.

29214337	Sleep-disordered breathing in patients with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is one of the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathies worldwide, and its vaso-occlusive and hemolytic crises cause considerable patient morbidity. A growing body of evidence has shown that sleep-disordered breathing, and in particular, obstructive sleep apnea, occurs at high frequency in the sickle cell population, and that there is significant overlap in the underlying pathophysiology of these two conditions. Through a variety of mechanisms including nocturnal hypoxemia and increased oxidative stress, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction, sickle cell anemia and sleep-disordered breathing potentiate each other's clinical effects and end-organ complications. Here, we will review the shared pathophysiologic mechanisms of these conditions and discuss their clinical sequelae. We will also examine the results of studies that have been carried out with clinical intervention of nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with sickle cell disease in the attempts to overcome the complications of the disease. Finally, we will propose the areas of investigation that merit further investigations in future in patients with sickle cell disease and sleep-disordered breathing.
30878319	Effect of increased dose of total body irradiation on graft failure associated with HLA-haploidentical transplantation in patients with severe haemoglobinopathies: a prospective clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: Although severe haemoglobinopathies can be cured with allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplantation, availability of matched donors and toxic effects can be problematic. We previously found that non-myeloablative haploidentical related bone marrow transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide expanded the donor pool while limiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, graft failure-albeit with full host haemopoietic recovery-occurred in 50% of patients. In this study, we investigated whether increasing total body irradiation from 200 cGy to 400 cGy would improve engraftment while maintaining the safety profile. METHODS: This study was done at Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD, USA). Patients aged 2-70 years receiving their first bone marrow transplant were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients received rabbit-derived intravenous anti-thymocyte globulin 0 5 mg/kg on day -9 and 2 mg/kg on days -8 and -7, intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -6 to -2, intravenous cyclophosphamide 14 5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, and total body irradiation 400 cGy administered as a single fraction on day -1. We collected unmanipulated bone marrow and infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis comprised intravenous cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg per day on days 3 and 4 after transplantation, oral mycophenolate mofetil 15 mg/kg per dose (maximum 1 g) every 8 h on days 5 to 35, and oral sirolimus to maintain a level of 5-15 ng/dL for at least 1 year starting on day 5. The original planned primary objectives of this phase 2 clinical trial were transplant-related mortality and progression-free survival. However, the coverage decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to only provide payment for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease on a clinical trial that had a comparison arm with patients not receiving bone marrow transplantation prompted the closure of this trial to accrual in 2017. Therefore, as we were unable to perform our planned statistical analysis, the primary objective was modified to evaluate engraftment, assessed by chimerism. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00489281. The study is closed to new participants and this is the primary analysis. FINDINGS: Between Sept 24, 2014, and Aug 1, 2017, we enrolled 17 consecutive patients: 12 (71%) with sickle cell disease and 5 (29%) with beta-thalassaemia major. The median patient age was 16 years (range 6-31, IQR 7 7-27 5). One (6%) of 17 patients had primary graft failure with recovery of host haemopoiesis. 13 (76%) of 17 patients achieved full donor chimerism and three (18%) had mixed donor-host chimerism. Five (29%) of 17 patients developed grade 2-4 acute GVHD, including four (24%) with maximal grade 2 GVHD and one (6%) with grade 3 GVHD. Chronic GVHD developed in three (18%) patients. As of their last follow-up visit, GVHD had resolved in all patients and no patients were receiving systemic GVHD therapy. All patients remained alive as of Aug 4, 2019, and the median follow-up duration was 705 days (range 355-1294; IQR 398-943). Only one (6%) of the 16 engrafted patients remained transfusion dependent, and 14 (88%) discontinued immunosuppression. INTERPRETATION: Increasing total body irradiation to 400 cGy substantially reduced graft failure while maintaining the safety of haploidentical bone marrow transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. These results suggest that engraftment after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation for haemoglobinopathies is possible, and primary graft failure-the main problem previously reported-might be addressed by this strategy. Therefore, this curative approach should no longer be restricted to patients with HLA-matched donors. FUNDING: Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund and US National Institutes of Health.
29443408	Vascular access for red blood cell exchange.	Red blood cell exchange is the process of removing red blood cells from a patient and replacing them with donated blood using either automated or manual techniques. Red blood cell exchange is a well-recognized and effective therapy for many red blood cell-related diseases, especially sickle cell disease. However, decisions regarding the best methods for vascular access are not intuitive and must account for the patient's clinical condition, complication risks, and lifestyle, especially in the context of long-term vascular access. In this review, we discuss the recognized indications for red blood cell exchange, considerations for the selection of exchange modality and vascular access, and recommendations for the appropriate care and prevention of risks associated with vascular access.
36147559	Use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger in fertility preservation for patients with inherited genetic disorders.	In patients with varying hematologic disorders (thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, etc.), inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, and immune deficiencies due to a single gene disorder, the advent of stem cell transplantation (SCT) as a treatment option has allowed for significant disease improvement, and possibly cure. This specific treatment option often requires exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and sometimes whole body radiation; therefore, primary ovarian insufficiency is often sequelae of the therapy. The optimization of fertility preservation protocols within this patient population is of extreme importance. This review aims to detail the use of GnRH agonist use within this patient population, within the context of fertility preservation cycles.

34889373	How to avoid the problem of erythrocyte alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Erythrocyte alloimmunization is a major barrier to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) because it can lead to transfusion deadlock and the development of life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Several risk factors have been identified, such as blood group polymorphism in these patients of African ancestry frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry and an inflammatory clinical state of the disease. The most important preventive measure is prophylactic red blood cell antigen matching, and there is a consensus that matching for Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and K antigens should be performed for all SCD patients. However, some patients are high responders and more at risk of developing antibodies and HTRs. For these patients, the extension of matching to other blood groups, including variant antigens of the RH blood group, the use of genotyping rather than serology to characterize significant blood groups, and the prophylactic administration of immunosuppressive treatments remain a matter of debate due to low levels of certainty concerning their effects and the difficulty of determining which patients, other than those already immunized, are at high risk. These issues were recently addressed by a panel of experts established by the American Society of Hematology. Here, we review and stratify the various interventions for preventing alloimmunization, based on the literature and our experience and taking into account the obstacles to their implementation and any future developments required.
28256747	Elbasvir/Grazoprevir for Patients With Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Inherited Blood Disorders: A Phase III Study.	Direct-acting antiviral agents have not been studied exclusively in patients with inherited blood disorders and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The objective of the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III C-EDGE IBLD study was to assess the safety and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) in patients with inherited bleeding disorders and HCV infection. One hundred fifty-nine adults with HCV infection and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease were enrolled at 31 study sites in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Thailand. Patients were given an oral, once-daily, fixed-dose combination of EBR/GZR 50 mg/100 mg for 12 weeks and randomized to the immediate-treatment group (ITG) or deferred-treatment group (DTG; placebo followed by active treatment). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in the ITG with unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks posttreatment (sustained virological response 12 weeks after completion of study treatment; SVR12) and the comparison of safety in the ITG and DTG. In the ITG, 100 of 107 patients (93.5%) achieved SVR12, 6 relapsed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in 94.7% (18 of 19), 97.6% (40 of 41), and 89.4% (42 of 47) of patients with sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported by 2.8% (n = 3) and 11.5% (n = 6) of patients in the ITG and DTG, respectively. Hemoglobin levels and international normalized ratio values were similar in patients receiving EBR/GZR and placebo; among patients with hemoglobinopathies, change in mean hemoglobin levels was similar in those receiving EBR/GZR compared to those receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: These results add to the expanding pool of data available for EBR/GZR, indicating a high level of efficacy and favorable tolerability in patients with HCV infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:736-745).
34077086	Live birth following preimplantation genetic testing to prevent sickle cell disease in a low resource setting: A case report.	Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) can detect sickle cell disease (HbSS) in embryos during In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), to ensure the birth of unaffected children. The prevalence of haemoglobin S gene (HbS) is high in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, but access to PGT-M services in the setting is limited. A couple with the sickle cell trait (HbAS) had IVF, following which 12 embryos were biopsied and the corresponding cells analyzed using minisequencing for whole genome amplification and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine each embryo's haemoglobin (Hb) genotype. Two HbAA (normal) embryos were transferred to the mother resulting in the birth of a live HbAA male infant at 38 weeks gestation. The child has remained well after nine months of follow up with HbAA at repeat genotype evaluation.
28802541	Opioid doses and acute care utilization outcomes for adults with sickle cell disease: ED versus acute care unit.	BACKGROUND: Acute care units (ACUs) with focused sickle cell disease (SCD) care have been shown to effectively address pain and limit hospitalizations compared to emergency departments (ED), the reason for differences in admission rates is understudied. Our aim was compare effects of usual care for adult SCD pain in ACU and ED on opioid doses and discharge pain ratings, hospital admission rates and lengths of stay. METHODS: In a retrospective, comparative cohort, single academic tertiary center study, 148 adults with sickle cell pain received care in the ED, ACU or both. From the medical records we documented opioid doses, unit discharge pain ratings, hospital admission rates, and lengths of stay. FINDINGS: Pain on admission to the ED averaged 8.7+-1.5 and to the ACU averaged 8.0+-1.6. The average pain on discharge from the ED was 6.4+-3.0 and for the ACU was 4.5+-2.5. 70% of the 144 ED visits resulted in hospital admissions as compared to 37% of the 73 ACU visits. Admissions from the ED or ACU had similar inpatient lengths of stay. Significant differences between ED and ACU in first opioid dose and hourly opioid dose were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Applying guidelines for higher dosing of opioids for acute painful episodes in adults with SCD in ACU was associated with improved pain outcomes and decreased hospitalizations, compared to ED. Adoption of this approach for SCD pain in ED may result in improved outcomes, including a decrease in hospital admissions.

32255722	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease.	Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and ASCO each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.
35891584	Neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease treated with nonmyeloablative matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation: A case series.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), cerebrovascular and cognitive insults can have lifelong consequences. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative therapy, and recent studies have demonstrated efficacy with reduced toxicity nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens, but little is known about neuropsychological outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes with medical correlates in children with SCD who received an NMA matched sibling donor (MSD) HCT. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of nine recipients with hemoglobin SS SCD who underwent MSD HCT using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NMA protocol. RESULTS: Mean full-scale intellectual functioning (FSIQ) was average pre-HCT (FSIQ = 92.1, SD 9.0; n = 8) and 2 years post-HCT (mean FSIQ = 96.6; SD 11.1; N = 9). Neuropsychological functioning was largely average across all cognitive domains, and no pre/post-HCT differences were found to be statistically significant given the small sample size. However, effect sizes revealed moderate improvements in processing speed (Cohen's d = .72) and verbal memory (Cohen's d = .60) post-HCT, and declines in measures of attention (Cohen's d = -.54) and fine motor speed and dexterity (Cohen's d = -.94). Parents endorsed better quality of life (Cohen's d = .91), less impact of SCD on their family, and less worry about their child's future (Cohen's d = 1.44). CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological functioning in a sample of children and adolescents treated uniformly with NMA MSD HCT remained stable or improved in most cognitive domains, and improvements in quality of life and family functioning were observed.
36975201	Gene therapy in sickle cell disease: Attitudes and informational needs of patients and caregivers.	"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that results in serious morbidity and early mortality. Novel therapies for SCD, most notably genetic therapies (GTs) and HLA-mismatched donor hematopoietic cell transplantation, are in clinical trials. While potentially curative, these interventions are some of the most intensive treatments for SCD and are associated with serious and life-altering side effects, which may manifest several years after treatment. Little is known about knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals with SCD, or their caregivers, toward existing and these emerging therapies. METHODS: Patients with SCD at least 13 years of age (n = 66) and caregivers (n = 38) were surveyed about knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding treatments for SCD. RESULTS: Only 4.8% felt ""extremely knowledgeable"" about GT for SCD while the majority (63.4%) reported little knowledge. Overall, health literacy was low among respondents. Most respondents had a neutral attitude regarding the safety of GT for SCD, and whether it was a good treatment for the disorder (56.7% and 58.6%, respectively). Only a few respondents endorsed the idea that GT was ""unsafe"" or ""not a good treatment"" (5.8% and 4.8%, respectively). There was an association between increasing knowledge about GT and agreement that it is safe (p = .012) and a good treatment for SCD (p = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Given that very few patients with SCD feel knowledgeable about GT and a majority have neutral feelings about the safety and utility of this new approach, culturally appropriate patient-centered education is urgently needed as these treatments get regulatory approval and proceed to the clinic."
32203007	Effects of repleting organic phosphates in banked erythrocytes on plasma metabolites and vasoactive mediators after red cell exchange transfusion in sickle cell disease.	"BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) exchange (RCE) transfusion therapy is indicated for certain patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although beneficial, this therapy is costly and inconvenient to patients, who may require it monthly or more often. Identification of blood and plasma biomarkers that could improve or help individualise RCE therapy is of interest. Here we examined relevant blood and plasma metabolites and biomarkers of vasoactivity and RBC fragility in a pilot study of SCD patients undergoing RCE using either standard RBC units or RBC units treated with a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved additive solution containing phosphate, inosine, pyruvate, and adenine (""PIPA""). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single-blind, cross-over pilot clinical trial, patients were randomised to receive either standard RBC exchange or PIPA-treated RBC exchange transfusion with each RCE session over a 6-month treatment period. Pre- and post-transfusion blood samples were obtained and analysed for RBC O2 affinity, ATP, purine metabolites, RBC microparticles, and cell free haemoglobin. RESULTS: Red blood cell O2 affinity was maintained after PIPA-RCE in contrast to standard RCE, after which P50 fell (net O2 affinity rose). Plasma ATP did not change significantly after RCE using either of the RBC unit types. Exchange transfusion with PIPA-treated RBC units led to modest increases in plasma inosine and hypoxanthine. Plasma cell free haemoglobin fell after either standard or PIPA-treated RBC exchange transfusion (novel findings), and to a similar extent. RBC-derived microparticles in the plasma fell significantly and similarly after both standard and PIPA-treated RCE transfusion. DISCUSSION: In summary, treatment of RBCs with PIPA prior to RCE elicited favourable or neutral changes in key metabolic and vascular biomarkers. Further study of its efficacy and safety is recommended and could ultimately serve to improve outcomes in chronically transfused SCD patients."

30599357	Gene therapy for blood diseases.	Genetic diseases affecting proteins and cells composing the blood may be treated by gene therapy using gene addition or gene editing methods. Protein deficiencies (e.g. hemophilia) are being approached using in vivo gene delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for therapeutic gene addition or gene editing. Blood cell diseases (e.g. sickle cell disease) are being approached using ex vivo gene addition or gene editing to treat isolated blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells or T cells that are then re-transplanted. In recent years, there has been much progress, and gene therapy is now routinely providing clinical benefit to patients with a variety of conditions. Several of these gene therapies have been licensed in the U.S. and EU and more for other disorders are being advanced toward licensure. The scope of therapeutic activity for gene therapy is expected to continue to expand as the technical capabilities advance.
30713307	Successful Treatment of Acute Chest Syndrome with Manual Exchange Transfusion in a Patient with Sickle Beta+-thalassemia.	Acute chest syndrome (ACS), characterized by fever, respiratory symptoms, and new pulmonary infiltration, is a serious complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Regardless of the etiology, the conventional treatment options for ACS include empirical antibiotic therapy, the administration of analgesics, and red cell transfusion. The indications and methods of red cell transfusion are critical. We herein report the case of a 26-year-old African-American man with SCD who developed ACS and who was successfully treated with manual exchange transfusion. Despite increasing globalization, SCD remains extremely rare in Japan. Manual exchange transfusion can be performed easily anywhere and should be considered for treating SCD patients presenting with ACS.
32977351	Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 March 2020; ISRCTN: 19 April 2020; AMED: 18 May 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov: 24 April 2020; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (212 participants) of three phytomedicines: Niprisan  (also known as Nicosan ), Ciklavit  and a powdered extract of Pfaffia paniculata were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan  may be effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality evidence). It did not appear to affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). The single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises, and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of Pfaffia paniculata on the laboratory parameters and symptoms of SCD (very low-quality of evidence). No adverse effects were reported with Niprisan  and Pfaffia paniculata (low- to very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in managing people with SCD and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit  and the powdered root extract of Pfaffia paniculata in managing SCD. Based on the published results for Niprisan  and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of the three trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in SCD. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials with improved study design and data collection are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing SCD.
31933169	Crizanlizumab: First Approval.	Crizanlizumab (Adakveo ; crizanlizumab-tmca) is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals for the prevention of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients with sickle cell disease. Crizanlizumab binds to P-selectin, thereby blocking its interaction with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. In November 2019, crizanlizumab received its first global approval in the USA, where it is indicated to reduce the frequency of VOCs in adults and paediatric patients aged >= 16 years with sickle cell disease. The drug is also under regulatory review in the EU for the prevention of VOCs in patients with sickle cell disease. The use of crizanlizumab (in combination with ruxolitinib) in myelofibrosis is also being evaluated in Australia, Spain, Germany and Hungary. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of crizanlizumab leading to this first approval for the reduction of VOCs in patients with sickle cell disease.
30480652	Ammonia Inhalation Does Not Increase Deadlift 1-Repetition Maximum in College-Aged Male and Female Weight Lifters.	Vigil, JN, Sabatini, PL, Hill, LC, Swain, DP, and Branch, JD. Ammonia inhalation does not increase deadlift 1-repetition maximum in college-aged male and female weight lifters. J Strength Cond Res 32(12): 3392-3397, 2018-Ammonia inhalant use by powerlifters and weight lifters is a prevalent practice with little research support for improved performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ammonia as a stimulant on athletic performance during a deadlift 1-repetition maximum (1RM) absolute strength test. Subjects (men: n = 10, mean +- SD age = 21 +- 1 year, mass = 72.5 +- 6.8 kg; and women: n = 10, age = 22 +- 5 years, mass = 66.2 +- 8.1 kg) were required to have at least 2 years of resistance training experience while lacking a history of asthma, lightheadedness, fainting, anaphylaxis, sickle cell traits, and other respiratory disorders. After a baseline 1RM test, subjects were paired by 1RM performance and gender, then randomly assigned in a counterbalanced treatment order to control (water) or ammonia trials after a minimum 72-hour recovery period for another 1RM test involving attempts at 100.0, 102.5, 105.0, and 107.5% of the established 1RM value. Testing was then repeated after the minimum rest period for the remaining trial. Results revealed the expected gender main effect for absolute deadlift 1RM (93.0 +- 29.5 [women]; 152.0 +- 29.5 kg [men]; p < 0.001), but no trial main effect (p = 0.874) or gender by trial interaction effect (baseline = 93.0 +- 15.3, 151.8 +- 42.3 kg; water = 92.0 +- 12.5, 150.9 +- 37.8 kg; ammonia = 92.5 +- 16.4, 153.4 +- 37.9 kg) for women and men, respectively (p = 0.559). Within the limitations of this study, there is no support for the practice of ammonia inhalation to improve deadlift 1RM in training or competition.

28259220	Renal Medullary Carcinoma and Sickle Cell Trait: A Push for Early Diagnosis and Intervention Report of Two Cases.	Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare but highly aggressive neoplasm that primarily affects young African Americans with sickle cell trait. Most patients present with macroscopic hematuria and have metastases at diagnosis. Chemotherapy, biologics directed against the more common renal cell carcinomas and radiation have all shown limited efficacy in treating patients with advanced RMC. We report two patients with RMC. Both had Stage IV disease. One underwent radical nephrectomy followed by radiation and biologic drug therapy but died five months later; the other underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy plus anti-angiogenesis treatment but died 15 months after diagnosis. Review of the literature suggests that early diagnosis and surgical intervention while the tumor is confined to the kidney offer the best prospect for long term survival. Since newborn screening for sickle cell is now mandated in the US, the at-risk population for RMC could be identified and followed by yearly urine dipstick testing for microscopic hematuria. Those who test positive can be further evaluated to rule out RMC.
30153113	Effective Pain Management After Total Hip Arthroplasty in a Sickle Cell Patient Emphasizing Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate/Methylprednisolone Acetate Administered via a Peripheral Nerve Blockade: A Case Report.	Pain control after total hip arthroplasty in sickle cell patients is challenging yet essential to prevent sickle cell crises or protracted hospital stays. We present a case of effective analgesia that lasted for weeks in a young opioid-tolerant female. This was achieved by the administration of glucocorticoids with different durations of action, dexamethasone sodium phosphate/methylprednisolone acetate, via a femoral/lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block placed preoperatively. Postoperatively, the patient's opioid demand was unchanged from her preoperative baseline. She met all the discharge requirements, including physical therapy targets, on postoperative day 2 and did not have any complications during the hospitalization.
34586618	Innovations in CRISPR-Based Therapies.	Gene and cell therapies have shown tremendous advancement in the last 5 years. Prominent examples include the successful use of CRISPR-edited stem cells for treating blood disorders like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, and ongoing clinical trials for treating blindness. This mini-review assesses the status of CRISPR-based therapies, both in vivo and ex vivo, and the challenges associated with clinical translation. In vivo CRISPR therapies have been used to treat eye and liver diseases due to the practicality of delivering editing components to the target tissue. In contrast, even though ex vivo CRISPR therapy involves cell isolation, expansion, and infusion, its advantages include characterizing the gene edits before infusion and restricting off-target effects in other tissues. Further, the safety, affordability, and feasibility of CRISPR therapies, especially for treating large number of patients, are discussed.

30640411	Medical interventions for traumatic hyphema.	BACKGROUND: Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and iris) subsequent to a blow or a projectile striking the eye. Hyphema uncommonly causes permanent loss of vision. Associated trauma (e.g. corneal staining, traumatic cataract, angle recession glaucoma, optic atrophy, etc.) may seriously affect vision. Such complications can lead to permanent impairment of vision. People with sickle cell trait/disease may be particularly susceptible to increases of elevated intraocular pressure. If rebleeding occurs, the rates and severity of complications increase. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of various medical interventions in the management of traumatic hyphema. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 6); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase.com; PubMed (1948 to June 2018); the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The date of the search was 28 June 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by the electronic and manual searches. In this review, we included randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared various medical (non-surgical) interventions versus other medical intervention or control groups for the treatment of traumatic hyphema following closed-globe trauma. We applied no restrictions regarding age, gender, severity of the closed-globe trauma, or level of visual acuity at the time of enrollment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted the data for the primary outcomes, visual acuity and time to resolution of primary hemorrhage, and secondary outcomes including: secondary hemorrhage and time to rebleed; risk of corneal blood staining, glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure, optic atrophy, or peripheral anterior synechiae; adverse events; and duration of hospitalization. We entered and analyzed data using Review Manager 5. We performed meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD). MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 randomized and seven quasi-randomized studies with a total of 2643 participants. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (systemic and topical aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest.We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity for any intervention, whether measured within two weeks (short term) or for longer periods. In a meta-analysis of two trials, we found no evidence of an effect of aminocaproic acid on long-term visual acuity (RR 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.29) or final visual acuity measured up to three years after the hyphema (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Eight trials evaluated the effects of various interventions on short-term visual acuity; none of these interventions was measured in more than one trial. No intervention showed a statistically significant effect (RRs ranged from 0.75 to 1.10). Similarly, visual acuity measured for longer periods in four trials evaluating different interventions was also not statistically significant (RRs ranged from 0.82 to 1.02). The evidence supporting these findings was of low or very low certainty.Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60) as assessed in six trials with 330 participants. A sensitivity analysis omitting two studies not using an intention-to-treat analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.08). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10) in two studies with 121 participants. We assessed the certainty of these findings as low and very low, respectively. Systemic tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55) in five trials with 578 participants, as did aminomethylbenzoic acid as reported in one study (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.41). The evidence to support an associated reduction in the risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e. corneal blood staining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compared with placebo. We found no evidence of an effect in the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose. The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of systemic aminocaproic acid compared with no use, but this outcome was not altered by any other intervention.The available evidence on usage of systemic or topical corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials.We found no evidence of an effect between a single versus binocular patch or ambulation versus complete bed rest on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity by any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although evidence was limited, it appears that people with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhaging. However, hyphema took longer clear in people treated with systemic aminocaproic acid.There is no good evidence to support the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the management of traumatic hyphema other than possibly to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage. Similarly, there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or non-drug interventions (such as binocular patching, bed rest, or head elevation) in the management of traumatic hyphema. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value.
28152086	NNKTT120, an anti-iNKT cell monoclonal antibody, produces rapid and sustained iNKT cell depletion in adults with sickle cell disease.	Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells can be activated to stimulate a broad inflammatory response. In murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD), interruption of iNKT cell activity prevents tissue injury from vaso-occlusion. NKTT120 is an anti-iNKT cell monoclonal antibody that has the potential to rapidly and specifically deplete iNKT cells and, potentially, prevent vaso-occlusion. We conducted an open-label, multi-center, single-ascending-dose study of NKTT120 to determine its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety in steady-state patients with SCD. Doses were escalated in a 3+3 study design over a range from 0.001 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg. Twenty-one adults with SCD were administered NKTT120 as part of 7 dose cohorts. Plasma levels of NKTT120 predictably increased with higher doses. Median half-life of NKTT120 was 263 hours. All subjects in the higher dose cohorts (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) demonstrated decreased iNKT cells below the lower limit of quantification within 6 hours after infusion, the earliest time point at which they were measured. In those subjects who received the two highest doses of NKTT120 (0.3, 1 mg/kg), iNKT cells were not detectable in the peripheral blood for a range of 2 to 5 months. There were no serious adverse events in the study deemed to be related to NKTT120. In adults with SCD, NKTT120 produced rapid, specific and sustained iNKT cell depletion without any infusional toxicity or attributed serious adverse events. The next step is a trial to determine NKTT120's ability to decrease rate of vaso-occlusive pain episodes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01783691.
36062975	Clinical outcome of pre-operative blood transfusion for sickle cell disease patients in post-operative complications.	BACKGROUND: Preoperative blood transfusion for patients with sickle cell disease is a debatable topic and it can be lifesaving. Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk for vaso-occlusive crisis due to the large concentration of sickle hemoglobin (HgbS) in their blood. Despite the current extensive research into this disease, there is still no consensus over whether blood transfusion is a preferable preoperative modality among patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. METHOD: A retrospective observational study, which enrolled 204 patients with Sickle cell disease who underwent surgery at King Fahad Hospital of the University (KFHU) over the last five years. The primary objective was to determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion for SCD patients undergoing surgical procedures will reduce postoperative complications related to SCD. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients were included, of which 30% had preoperative blood transfusion. Majority of patient 44% had undergone cholecystectomy. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients who did not undergo blood transfusion had significantly higher risk to develop post-operative SCD complications (OR = 3.07, P value = 0.002). In addition, they had significantly prolonged hospitalization (OR = 2.22, P value = 0.08). In contrast, patients who received blood transfusion had lower risk for developing post-operative SCD-related complications (OR = 1.87, P value = 0.29), and decrease in the duration of hospitalization by (OR = 0.49, P value = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients who had not undergone preoperative blood transfusion had higher risk to develop postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay compared to those who underwent blood transfusion.
36273803	Clinical outcomes and 30-day readmissions associated with high-output heart failure.	BACKGROUND: High-output heart failure (HOHF) is an underdiagnosed type of heart failure (HF) characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the causes, mortality, and readmissions related to HOHF within the United States. METHODS: Data were collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Readmissions Database (NRD) from January 1, 2017, to November 30, 2019. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), diagnostic codes to identify encounters with HOHF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). RESULTS: Of the total 5,080,985 encounters with HF, 3,897 hospitalizations (mean age 62.5 +- 17.9 years, 56.5% females) with HOHF and 5,077,088 hospitalizations with HFrEF were recorded. The most commonly associated putative etiologies of HOHF included pulmonary disease (19.8%), morbid obesity (9.9%), sepsis (9.6%), cirrhosis (8.9%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (7.9%), hyperthyroidism (5.5%), and sickle cell disease (3.3%). There was no significant difference in mortality rates [4.3% vs. 5.2%; odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2] between HOHF and HFrEF. However, the 30-day readmission rate for HOHF was significantly lower than that for HFrEF (5.7% vs. 21.2%; OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30-0.51). Cardiovascular (39.9%) followed by hematological (20.6%) complications accounted for the majority of 30-day readmissions in the HOHF group. CONCLUSIONS: HOHF is an infrequently reported cardiovascular complication associated with noncardiovascular disorders and is encountered in 0.07% of all encounters with HF. Although comparable in-hospital mortality between studied cohorts was observed, raising awareness and timely recognition of this entity are warranted.
30466839	Contraception for Adolescents with Medically Complex Conditions.	Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed, published, and updated evidence-based guidelines to support medical providers in the provision of contraceptives to patients with specific medical conditions or characteristics. The goal of these guidelines is to provide recommendations on the safe use of contraceptives with the goal of removing unnecessary medical barriers to access and use of contraceptives, thus decreasing the number of unintended pregnancies. Many medical conditions increase a patient's risk of venous thromboembolism; a risk that may also be increased with specific contraceptives. Specific conditions that require more enhanced contraceptive counseling due to their frequency in adolescence and their association either with adverse events during pregnancy or with increased risk for specific contraceptives are detailed by the WHO and CDC and are summarized herein. Adolescents with morbid obesity, migraine headache, cardiac conditions, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or seizure disorders would benefit from greater attention to the urgency of exploring highly effective contraceptive methods. Details of the considerations that should be used in providing contraceptive care to adolescents with each of these medical conditions, as per WHO and CDC guidelines, are provided in this review. The ultimate goal in contraceptive counseling is the balancing of risk and benefit to arrive at the best therapeutic option, maintaining patient preference as a priority, as that will enhance adherence and comfort with the contraceptive method. Each patient must be assessed for pregnancy risk and be allowed full risk reduction and education regarding contraceptive options.
29977264	Impact of aerobic exercises on selected inflammatory markers and immune system response among patients with sickle cell anemia in asymptomatic steady state.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is well recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease. Despite progress in therapy, SCA remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The relationship between exercise and immune function has been of great interest to the scientific community and the lay public. The aim of this study was to measure the impact of aerobic exercise training on the immunologic parameters and inflammatory cytokines of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in asymptomatic steady state. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty asymptomatic sickle cell anemia patients were involved in this study, their age ranged from 25- 40 years and were assigned to two sub-groups; group (A) received aerobic exercise training for 12 weeks, however group (B) received no training intervention for 12 weeks. Parameters of CD3, CD4 and CD8 were quantified, Leukocyte, differential counts, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured before and after 12 weeks, at the end of the study. RESULTS: The mean values of CD3, CD4 and CD8, leukocyte, monocytes counts, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased in group (A), while group (B) showed non-significant changes in these parameters. Also; there were significant differences between mean levels of the investigated parameters in group (A) and group (B) after treatment. CONCLUSION: The current study provides evidence that aerobic exercise training improves inflammatory markers and immune system in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in asymptomatic steady state.

36096996	Umbilical cord blood as a hematopoietic stem cell source in transplantation for pediatric sickle cell disease: current challenges and strategies.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD), a hemolytic disorder that arises due to a point mutation in the hemoglobin A gene. The result is an abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS) replacing hemoglobin A. Of the spectrum of sickle hemoglobinoapthies, homozygous (HbSS) and HbSbeta0 thalassemia manifest severe forms of disease characterized by chronic endothelial injury/vasculopathy, ischemic pain, and vital organ damage that commence in childhood and escalate with age resulting in impaired quality of life, increased healthcare burden, and early mortality. HSCT has demonstrated durable disease control and regression of symptoms. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantation can achieve disease-free survival of > 90%. However, < 18% of SCD patients in the United States have a MSD. Familial mismatched and unrelated donors from registries provide alternate stem cell sources. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) from family or cord blood banks expand donor sources and are attractive due to donor-independent ease of use and availability. These naive cells tolerate greater degrees of HLA-mismatch. The primary challenge with UCB is optimizing cell dose toward successful engraftment and timely immune reconstitution while minimizing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This review summarizes evidence that UCB remains a promising stem cell source where modern methods of graft expansion, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, and infection control can overcome these challenges and retain the value of this intervention.
33010885	Risk factors for complications after abdominal surgery in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Abdominal surgery in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) carries an increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative transfusions are frequently given to decrease the risk of vasoocclusive events. However, risk factors for postoperative complications are not well-defined in the pediatric population. METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD undergoing common abdominal operations were identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database from 2012 to 2018. Outcomes of interest were the incidence rates of 1) any complication or readmission, and 2) serious SCD-related complications (stroke, new onset seizure, ventilator support >24 h postoperatively, or readmission with SCD crisis within 30 days of surgery). Patients were categorized by transfusion approach (transfusion within 48 h before surgery vs. no transfusion) and preoperative hematocrit (<21.0, 21.0-23.9, 24.0-26.9, 27.0-29.9, >=30.0). Stratified bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors for complications. RESULTS: A total of 813 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 470 cholecystectomy, 251 splenectomy, 39 appendectomy, and 53 combination procedures; 13% of cases were urgent or emergent. Preoperative hematocrit levels were <21.0 in 3%, 21.0-23.9 in 10%, 24.0-26.9 in 17%, 27.0-29.9in 30%, and >=30.0 in 41% of patients; 52% received perioperative transfusion. The 30-day incidences of any complication/readmission and SCD-related complications were 12% and 4%, respectively. On bivariate analyses, urgent/emergent case status was the only significant predictor of complications, carrying risk of 20% and 8% for overall and SCD-related complications, respectively; this finding persisted on multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.0.2-3.29, p = 0.04). Neither preoperative transfusion nor preoperative hematocrit level was associated with complication risk, although there was a trend toward higher SCD-related complications in patients with preoperative hematocrit <21.0 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of pediatric SCD patients undergoing abdominal surgery, there was no clear association between postoperative complications and the transfusion approach or the preoperative hematocrit level within the range above 21.0. Urgent/emergent surgical procedures carried a nearly two-fold higher complication risk compared to elective procedures. Future studies should prospectively evaluate preoperative transfusion approaches and compare immediate and delayed operative management to nonoperative management in this population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Retrospective review.
28892533	Association of Guideline-Adherent Antibiotic Treatment With Readmission of Children With Sickle Cell Disease Hospitalized With Acute Chest Syndrome.	Importance: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a common, serious complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and a leading cause of hospitalization and death in both children and adults with SCD. Little is known about the effectiveness of guideline-recommended antibiotic regimens for the care of children hospitalized with ACS. Objectives: To use a large, national database to describe patterns of antibiotic use for children with SCD hospitalized for ACS and to determine whether receipt of guideline-adherent antibiotics was associated with lower readmission rates. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including 14 480 hospitalizations in 7178 children (age 0-22 years) with a discharge diagnosis of SCD and either ACS or pneumonia. Information was obtained from 41 children's hospitals submitting data to the Pediatric Health Information System from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016. Exposures: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guideline-adherent (macrolide with parenteral cephalosporin) vs non-guideline-adherent antibiotic regimens. Main Outcomes and Measures: Acute chest syndrome-related and all-cause 7- and 30-day readmissions. Results: Of the 14 480 hospitalizations, 6562 (45.3%) were in girls; median (interquartile range) age was 9 (4-14) years. Guideline-adherent antibiotics were provided in 10 654 of 14 480 hospitalizations for ACS (73.6%). Hospitalizations were most likely to include guideline-adherent antibiotics for children aged 5 to 9 years (3230 of 4047 [79.8%]) and declined to the lowest level for children 19 to 22 years (697 of 1088 [64.1%]). Between-hospital variation in antibiotic regimens was wide, with use of guideline-adherent antibiotics ranging from 24% to 90%. Children treated with guideline-adherent antibiotics had lower 30-day ACS-related (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00) and all-cause (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39-0.64) readmission rates vs children who received other regimens (cephalosporin and macrolide vs neither drug class). Conclusions and Relevance: Current approaches to antibiotic treatment in children with ACS vary widely, but guideline-adherent therapy appears to result in fewer readmissions compared with non-guideline-adherent therapy. Efforts to increase the dissemination and implementation of SCD treatment guidelines are warranted as is comparative effectiveness research to strengthen the underlying evidence base.
33545079	Hematopoietic-Stem-Cell-Targeted Gene-Addition and Gene-Editing Strategies for beta-hemoglobinopathies.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a well-defined point mutation in the beta-globin gene and therefore is an optimal target for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene-addition/editing therapy. In HSC gene-addition therapy, a therapeutic beta-globin gene is integrated into patient HSCs via lentiviral transduction, resulting in long-term phenotypic correction. State-of-the-art gene-editing technology has made it possible to repair the beta-globin mutation in patient HSCs or target genetic loci associated with reactivation of endogenous gamma-globin expression. With both approaches showing signs of therapeutic efficacy in patients, we discuss current genetic treatments, challenges, and technical advances in this field.
29761371	Tolerability and efficacy of deferasirox in patients with transfusional iron overload: results from a German 2-year non-interventional study.	BACKGROUND: Iron overload (IOL) due to repetitive transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC) has a major impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease. However, whether IOL influences the outcome of elderly patients with myeloid malignancies is not yet clear. Moreover, clinical trials have reported high drop-out rates during treatment with the oral iron chelator deferasirox (DFX). AIM: Here we report the results of a 2-year prospective observational study that aimed at describing the routine use of DFX in patients with hematological malignancies with regard to safety, efficacy and handling of the drug in a routine setting. RESULTS: A total of 406 patients were included. 58% of the patients were male. Most of the patients had myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (68%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (14%). Median time from first transfusion to study enrollment was 1.1 years (0-25.5 years) and most patients were chelation naive (91%) at enrollment. With regard to transfusion burden, most of the patients were moderately or mildly transfusion-dependent with 53% receiving 2-4 and 27% receiving less than 2 units of pRBC per month. Serum ferritin decreased from a mean of 2305 mug/l (+- 1449 mug/l) to a mean of 1910 mug/l (+- 1529 mug/l) at 24 months. There was no substantial change in transfusion-dependence during the observation period. Dose adjustments were reported in 48% of the patients with dose-escalation strategies being the most frequent reason for dosage increases (49%). The median observation time was 355 days (5-1080 days). Median duration of exposure to DFX was 322 days (2-1078 days). Two-hundred and ninety (72%) patients discontinued the trial prematurely after a median time of 235 days (1-808 days). Death (29%) and adverse events (23%) were the main reasons for discontinuation. Eleven percent of the patients discontinued treatment due to sufficient decrease in serum ferritin. Most frequent adverse events were decrease in creatinine clearance (22%), increase in serum creatinine (18%) and diarrhea (16%). CONCLUSION: This descriptive trial confirms the efficacy of DFX in decreasing the serum ferritin. Moreover, the high drop-out rates seen in prospective trials are recapitulated in this study, which can be attributed to adverse events in a substantial proportion of patients.

38015105	Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for vaso-occlusive episodes in children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease.	"BACKGROUND: While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) admitted for a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) can help reduce red blood cell sickling, clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an ""IVF ratio"" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system."

37883803	Cerebral hemodynamic changes after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.	Preliminary evidence from four adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) improves cerebral hemodynamics. HSCT largely normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD. We tested the hypothesis in adults with SCD that cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without sickle trait (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years). Prior to transplant, 7 patients had neurological indications for transplant (e.g., overt stroke) and 4 had non-neurological reasons for haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT). All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004). Mean CBF declined significantly following haploBMT (post-transplant CBF=48.2+-13.9 ml/100g/min, p=0.003). OEF was not different from controls at baseline and did not change significantly following HaploBMT (pre-transplant: 43.1 6.7%; post-transplant: 39.6 7.0%, p=0.34). Post-transplant, CBF and OEF were not significantly different from controls (CBF=48.2 13.4 ml/100g/min; p=0.78, and OEF=39.6 7.0%; p>0.99). CMRO2 did not change significantly following haploBMT (pre-transplant=3.18 0.87 ml O2/100g/min; post-transplant: 2.95 0.83; p=0.56). Major complications of haploBMT included one infection-related death and one severe chronic graft versus host disease. HaploBMT in adults with SCD reduces CBF to control values and maintains OEF and CMRO2 on average at levels observed in healthy adult controls.
32681734	Muscle structural, energetic and functional benefits of endurance exercise training in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients display skeletal muscle hypotrophy, altered oxidative capacity, exercise intolerance and poor quality of life. We previously demonstrated that moderate-intensity endurance training is beneficial for improving muscle function and quality of life of patients. The present study evaluated the effects of this moderate-intensity endurance training program on skeletal muscle structural and metabolic properties. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets were obtained from 33. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the non-training (n = 18) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental cycling tests were performed before and after the training program. Endurance training increased type I muscle fiber surface area (P = .038), oxidative enzyme activity [citrate synthase, P < .001; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, P = .009; type-I fiber cytochrome c oxidase, P = .042; respiratory chain complex IV, P = .017] and contents of respiratory chain complexes I (P = .049), III (P = .005), IV (P = .003) and V (P = .002). Respiratory frequency, respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate concentration and rating of perceived exertion were all lower at a given submaximal power output after training vs non-training group (all P < .05). The muscle content of proteins involved in glucose transport and pH regulation were unchanged in the training group relative to the non-training group. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise program improved exercise capacity and muscle structural and oxidative properties. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.
32250453	Interventions for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD. Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits and may lower intelligence quotient. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 14 November 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 07 October 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention. Three trials compared the use of regular long-term red blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children with no previous long-term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long-term red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarcts) Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124 participants, low-quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low-quality evidence). No deaths were reported in either trial. Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of: acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Long-term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate -0.54; 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants; one trial) Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low-quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low-quality evidence). The trial did not report: comparative numbers for SCD-related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention, children (121 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts); all-cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD-related complications, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low-quality evidence). Secondary prevention, children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all-cause mortality, Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to 253.66) (very low-quality evidence). Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD-related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low-quality evidence). Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD. Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, long-term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke, and other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises). In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts. No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions. Switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts and SCD-related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention. All other evidence in this review is of very low-quality.
32892842	Transfusion support in patients with sickle cell disease.	Blood transfusions are an integral component of the management of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Red cells can be administered as a simple transfusion, part of a modified exchange procedure involving manual removal of autologous red cells and infusion of donor red cells, and part of an automated red cell exchange procedure using apheresis techniques. Individuals with sickle cell disease are at risk of multiple complications of blood transfusions, including transfusional hemosiderosis, auto- and alloimmunization to minor red cell and human leukocyte antigens, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and hyper-hemolysis. In low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where a directed donor system is prevalent and limited laboratory methods are in place to perform extended red cell phenotyping, leukodepletion of cellular products, and infectious disease screening, there are additional challenges to providing safe and adequate transfusion support for this patient population. We review current indications for acute and chronic transfusions in sickle cell disease that are derived primarily from randomized controlled trials and observational studies in children living in high-income countries. We will highlight populations with unique transfusion needs, such as pregnant women and children, as well as the role of the transfusion medicine consultative service for individuals with sickle cell disease planning to have curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Finally, we will discuss risk factors for alloimmunization in individuals with sickle cell disease, emerging new strategies to prevent alloimmunization in this population, and critical gaps in the implementation of transfusion guidelines for sickle cell disease in high- and low-income countries.
29633667	Successful Use of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in an Adult Patient with Sickle Cell Anemia and Severe Acute Chest Syndrome.	A 25-year-old female with sickle cell anemia presented with respiratory failure due to acute chest syndrome (ACS). Given her severely compromised cardiopulmonary status, she was started on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). After 20 days, the patient's respiratory status improved and she was successfully decannulated. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be utilized for severe ACS in adult patients with sickle cell disease. Prompt initiation of this modality may improve outcomes in adult patients with sickle cell disease complicated by life threatening ACS.
36775794	Complementary and alternative medicine for children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular alternative to opioid and other analgesics in sickle cell disease (SCD). We review the effectiveness, prevalence, and factors associated with CAM use in the pediatric SCD population. METHODS: The review protocol was created based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were examined. The prevalence of CAM use in pediatric patients with SCD ranged from 36 to 84.5%. Common inpatient CAM interventions were yoga, virtual reality, and acupuncture, which decreased pain scale scores. Outpatient CAMs were consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, massage therapy, and guided-imagery, which increased pain tolerability and decreased pain scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: CAM modalities can decrease pain scale scores. However, the impact of specific CAM modalities on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absences were inconclusive.
28902183	Patient characteristics affect the response to ketamine and opioids during the treatment of vaso-occlusive episode-related pain in sickle cell disease.	BackgroundN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation has been implicated in the pathobiology of inflammatory, nociceptive and neuropathic pain, opioid tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and central sensitization. Some of those mechanisms underlie sickle cell disease(SCD)-associated pain.MethodsWe conducted an exploratory cohort study of SCD patients who during vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) received subanesthetic doses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, ketamine, as an adjunct to opioids. We sought to identify predictors of changes in pain scores and of the percentage of ketamine infusions associated with meaningful changes (>=20% reduction) in pain and opioid consumption.ResultsEight-five patients received 181 ketamine infusions for VOE-associated pain. Combined with opioids, ketamine yielded significant decrease in pain scores and opioid consumption. Ketamine administered to males and to younger patients yielded greater pain score decrease compared with females (P=0.013) and older patients (P=0.018). Fifty-four percent of infusions yielded meaningful reductions in pain scores, and in multivariate analysis, sex, age group, pain location, and infusion duration independently predicted pain score changes.ConclusionThis study suggests that in SCD patients admitted with VOE-associated pain, ketamine has age- and sex-dependent effects. These data can inform sample and effect size calculations for controlled trials to determine which SCD patients would benefit most from ketamine.
33560399	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with omidubicel in sickle cell disease.	Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) do not have HLA-matched related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unrelated cord blood (UCB) is an alternative graft option but is historically associated with high graft failure rates, with inadequate cell dose a major limitation. Omidubicel is a nicotinamide-based, ex vivo-expanded UCB product associated with rapid engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that increasing the UCB cell dose with this strategy would lead to improved engraftment in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative HSCT for SCD. We report the outcomes of a phase 1/2 study in 13 patients with severe SCD who received omidubicel in combination with an unmanipulated UCB graft and 3 who received a single omidubicel graft. Grafts were minimally matched with patients at 4 of 6 HLA alleles. Median age at transplant was 13 years. A median CD34+ expansion of ~80-fold was observed in omidubicel and led to rapid neutrophil engraftment (median, 7 days). Long-term engraftment was derived from the unmanipulated graft in most of the double cord blood recipients. Two of the 3 single omidubicel recipients also had sustained engraftment. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was high, but resolved in all surviving patients. Event-free survival in the double cord group was 85% (median follow-up 4 years). All 3 patients in the single cord group were alive at 1 year after transplantation. Ex vivo expansion of UCB with omidubicel supports engraftment in patients with SCD. This approach to decreasing the incidence of GVHD should be optimized for general use in patients with SCD. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01590628.
30941859	Health literacy and knowledge of chronic transfusion therapy in adolescents with sickle cell disease and caregivers.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may require chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for prevention of stroke or other complications. Limited health literacy (HL) is common and is associated with poor health-related knowledge and outcomes in chronic disease. We sought to assess HL and transfusion knowledge in patients with SCD on CTT and their caregivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients was conducted in outpatient hematology clinics. Forty-five pairs of adolescent patients and caregivers and 20 caregivers of pre-adolescent patients completed the Newest Vital Sign HL assessment and answered questions assessing SCD and transfusion knowledge. Community-level median income and unemployment rates were estimated from Census data. We computed the correlation of HL with knowledge and compared each to Census variables, payor status, educational attainment, and stroke. RESULTS: HL was inadequate in 22 (34%) caregivers and 31 (69%) adolescents. Adequate caregiver HL was associated with higher educational attainment but not community-level socioeconomics or payor status. Mean knowledge score was lower in adolescents than in caregivers and correlated with age in adolescents (r = 0.42, P = .004). HL correlated with knowledge (r = 0.46, P < .0001). There were no significant correlations of HL or knowledge between adolescents and their caregivers. Neither HL nor knowledge was associated with prior stroke. The greatest knowledge was demonstrated for iron overload and SCD genotype, whereas knowledge gaps existed in alloimmunization, indication for CTT, and SCD curative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced educational resources in transfusion therapy, alloimmunization, and curative therapy are needed for patients with SCD and caregivers of all HL levels.
29533274	Livedoid Vasculopathy Presenting in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.	We report a case in which a 43-year-old African American male with medical history of sickle cell disease (SCD) presented with a nonhealing ulcer. Biopsy revealed features of livedoid vasculopathy. Previously, livedoid vasculopathy had only been described in a patient with sickle cell trait, but never in a patient with SCD. Livedoid vasculopathy most commonly affects the distal lower extremities and is characterized by irregular, punched-out, painful ulcers that heal with stellate white scars of atrophie blanche. Histologically, it reveals segmental hyalinizing vessels, focal thrombosis, and endothelial proliferation. The etiology is currently unclear, but it has been shown to be related to procoagulant states and a diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy should prompt a thorough hypercoagulable workup, including testing for SCD in high-risk patients.
32339311	Celocentesis for early prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy.	OBJECTIVE: Celocentesis is an invasive technique that can provide prenatal diagnosis of single-gene disorders, from as early as 7 weeks' gestation. The objective of this study was to examine the safety of celocentesis. METHODS: In this prospective study, celocentesis was performed for prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy in 402 singleton pregnancies in which both parents were carriers of beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease trait. We assessed procedure-related maternal discomfort or pain, success of sampling and obtaining results, pregnancy outcome and postnatal follow-up. RESULTS: First, celocentesis was carried out at a median gestational age of 8.6 (range, 6.9-9.9) weeks and celomic fluid was successfully aspirated in 99.8% of cases. Second, 67% of women had no or only mild discomfort, 18% had moderate discomfort, 12% had mild-to-moderate pain and 3% had severe pain. Third, prenatal diagnosis from analysis of the celomic fluid was successful in 93.8% cases, and in the last 121 cases, it was always successful. Fourth, in all cases of successful sampling and analysis of celomic fluid, the diagnosis was concordant with results obtained from additional prenatal or postnatal testing. Fifth, in addition to diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy, quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction analysis, which was performed to evaluate maternal contamination using several markers for chromosomes X, Y, 21, 18 and 13, led to the accurate diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidy. Sixth, in all cases of an affected fetus diagnosed by celocentesis in which the parents chose termination of pregnancy, this was carried out < 10 weeks' gestation. Seventh, in 97.1% (298/307) of the continuing pregnancies there was live birth, in seven (2.3%) there was miscarriage and in two (0.7%) there was loss to follow-up. Eighth, fetal abnormalities were diagnosed in three (1%) cases, including unilateral transverse amputation of the forearm, unilateral moderate hydronephrosis and small-bowel duplication. All neonates were examined by a pediatrician and were found to be phenotypically normal, except for the three cases with a prenatally diagnosed defect. CONCLUSIONS: Celocentesis can be used for early prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, and the procedure-related risk of pregnancy complications appears to be low. Copyright   2020 ISUOG.

30387237	Indwelling ports for prophylactic RBC exchanges in sickle cell patients: Comparison of bard and vortex ports.	INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell exchange (RCE) procedures are commonly used for stroke prevention in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. We compared two different dual lumen ports used for RCE because differences between the port and catheter design may lead to functional variance. METHODS: We reviewed the RCE parameters of SCD patients following implantable port placement encountered at a single institution. Five Vortex and four Bard ports were used and compared. Patients were followed for 1-24 exchange procedures over 3-26 months performed between 2013 and 2015. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent 124 RCE procedures with no failures. A total of 74 exchanges used Vortex ports with a mean flow rate of 45.2 mL/min while 50 exchanges used Bard ports with a mean flow rate of 42.1 mL/min which was a significant difference (P = .002). A total of 85 exchanges with tPA administration preprocedure had a mean flow rate of 43.8 mL/min while 39 exchanges without had a mean flow rate of 45.4 mL/min which was not a significant difference (P = .19). CONCLUSION: Both the Bard and Vortex ports functioned well during our study period with no treatment failures, no significant complications requiring removal or replacement, and adequate mean flow rates. While the difference in mean flow rates was statistically significant between Vortex and Bard ports, there may not be a practical difference in performance. There also does not appear to be a significant benefit in flow rates with preprocedure tPA. We conclude that both ports may be a satisfactory choice for vascular access in SCD patients expected to undergo regularly scheduled RCE.
36890729	Longitudinal effect of disease-modifying therapy on left ventricular diastolic function in children with sickle cell anemia.	Cardiac abnormalities seen in sickle cell anemia (SCA) include diastolic dysfunction, which has been shown to be associated with high morbidity and early mortality. The effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) on diastolic dysfunction is poorly understood. We prospectively evaluated the effects of hydroxyurea and monthly erythrocyte transfusions on diastolic function parameters over 2 years. A total of 204 subjects with HbSS or HbSbeta0-thalassemia (mean age 11 +- 3.7 years), unselected for disease severity, had diastolic function assessed with surveillance echocardiograms twice, 2 years apart. During this 2-year observation period, 112 participants received DMTs (hydroxyurea, n = 72, monthly erythrocyte transfusions, n = 40), 34 initiated hydroxyurea, and 58 did not receive any DMT. The entire cohort showed an increase in left atrial volume index (LAVi) of 3.40 +- 10.86 mL/m2, p = .001 over 2 years. This increase in LAVi was independently associated with anemia, high baseline E/e' or LV dilation. Individuals not exposed to DMT were younger (mean age 8.8 +- 2.9 years), but at baseline their prevalence of abnormal diastolic parameters was similar to that of the DMT-exposed participants who were older (mean age 12 +- 3.8 years). Participants on DMTs saw no improvement in diastolic function over the study period. In fact, participants on hydroxyurea saw a possible worsening in diastolic parameters (14% increase in LAVi and ~5% decrease in septal e') but also a ~9% decrease in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate if exposure to DMT for a longer duration or achieving higher HbF might be beneficial in alleviating diastolic dysfunction.
30282642	Successful hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and apheresis collection using plerixafor alone in sickle cell patients.	Novel therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) based on genetically engineered autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are critically dependent on a safe and effective strategy for cell procurement. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of plerixafor when used in transfused patients with SCD for HSC mobilization. Six adult patients with SCD were recruited to receive a single dose of plerixafor, tested at lower than standard (180 microg/kg) and standard (240 microg/kg) doses, followed by CD34+ cell monitoring in peripheral blood and apheresis collection. The procedures were safe and well-tolerated. Mobilization was successful, with higher peripheral CD34+ cell counts in the standard vs the low-dose group. Among our 6 donors, we improved apheresis cell collection results by using a deep collection interface and starting apheresis within 4 hours after plerixafor administration. In the subjects who received a single standard dose of plerixafor and followed the optimized collection protocol, yields of up to 24.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were achieved. Interestingly, the collected CD34+ cells were enriched in immunophenotypically defined long-term HSCs and early progenitors. Thus, we demonstrate that plerixafor can be employed safely in patients with SCD to obtain sufficient HSCs for potential use in gene therapy.
28052556	Platinum plus bortezomib for the treatment of pediatric renal medullary carcinoma: Two cases.	Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) was first described over two decades ago as the seventh sickle nephropathy. Survival after diagnosis with metastatic disease still rarely extends beyond 1 year, with recent reports of median overall survival in patients treated with platinum therapy being just 10 months. We describe our experience using platinum-based chemotherapy plus the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to treat metastatic RMC in two pediatric patients who had complete responses. One patient passed away 7 years after diagnosis, while another remains disease free nearly 2 years from diagnosis.
32965032	Automated RBC Exchange has a greater effect on whole blood viscosity than manual whole blood exchange in adult patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is the cornerstone treatment to reduce the clinical severity of sickle cell disease (SCD), but we need to maintain the haematocrit (Hct) within an acceptable range to avoid a deleterious increase in blood viscosity. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of manual versus automated red blood cell (RBC) Exchange on haematological parameters and blood viscosity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective, single-centre, open nonrandomized observational study included forty-three sickle cell patients: 12 had automated RBC Exchange and 31 manual RBC Exchange. Samples were collected in EDTA tubes just before and within one hour after the end of the RBC Exchange to measure the haematological parameters and blood viscosity. RESULTS: Both automated and manual RBC Exchange decreased haemoglobin S levels and leucocyte and platelet counts, but the decrease was greater for automated RBC Exchange. Manual RBC Exchange caused a significant rise in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels and did not change blood viscosity. In contrast, automated RBC Exchange decreased blood viscosity without any significant change in haematocrit and only a very slight increase in haemoglobin levels. The change in blood viscosity correlated with the modifications of haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, irrespective of the RBC Exchange procedure. When adjusted for the volume of RBC Exchange, the magnitude of change in each biological parameter was not different between the two procedures. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the automated RBC Exchange provided greater haematological and haemorheological benefits than manual RBC Exchange, mainly because of the higher volume exchanged, suggesting that automated RBC Exchange should be favoured over manual RBC Exchange when possible and indicated.
38138299	Pain Control for Sickle Cell Crisis, a Novel Approach? A Retrospective Study.	Background and Objectives: Pain management poses a significant challenge for patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the inflammatory response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for VOC in SCD patients has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing pain and consequently enhancing the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of VOC in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of sickle cell patients in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in SCD. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric pain score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine SCD adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of VOC in whom LRA was used for pain management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three patients and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in pain and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves pain scores, reduces opioid consumption in SCD patients with refractory pain, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.
30947870	The Liver in Sickle Cell Disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease can develop liver disease as a result of intrahepatic sickling of erythrocytes, viral hepatitis and iron overload secondary to multiple blood transfusions, and gallstone disease as a result of chronic hemolysis. The spectrum of clinical liver disease is wide and often multifactorial. Some patients develop cirrhosis that may progress to end-stage liver failure. Limited evidence exists for medical treatments. Exchange blood transfusions may improve outcomes in the acute liver syndromes. Liver transplantation may be an option for chronic liver disease. The role for prophylactic cholecystectomy in preventing complications of gallstone disease is controversial.
30578732	Transfusion of red blood cells stored for shorter versus longer duration for all conditions.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common treatment for anaemia in many conditions. The safety and efficacy of transfusing RBC units that have been stored for different durations before a transfusion is a current concern. The duration of storage for a RBC unit can be up to 42 days. If evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) were to indicate that clinical outcomes are affected by storage duration, the implications for inventory management and clinical practice would be significant. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of using red blood cells (RBCs) stored for a shorter versus a longer duration, or versus RBCs stored for standard practice duration, in people requiring a RBC transfusion. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed (for epublications), LILACS, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science CPCI-S and four international clinical trial registries on 20 November 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration, or versus standard practice storage duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 trials (42,835 participants) in this review.The GRADE quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate for our primary outcome of in-hospital and short-term mortality reported at different time points.Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration Eleven trials (2249 participants) compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration. Two trials enrolled low birth weight neonates, two enrolled children with severe anaemia secondary to malaria or sickle cell disease, and eight enrolled adults across a range of clinical settings (intensive care, cardiac surgery, major elective surgery, hospitalised in-patients, haematology outpatients). We judged only two trials to be at low risk of bias across all domains; most trials had an unclear risk for multiple domains.Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration probably leads to little or no difference in mortality at seven-day follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 3.06; 1 trial, 3098 participants; moderate quality evidence) or 30-day follow-up (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.50 to 1.45; 2 trials, 1121 participants; moderate quality evidence) in adults undergoing major elective cardiac or non-cardiac surgery.For neonates, no studies reported on the primary outcome of in-hospital or short-term mortality. At 40 weeks gestational age, the effect of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration on the risk of death was uncertain, as the quality of evidence is very low (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.85; 1 trial, 52 participants).The effect of RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration on the risk of death in children with severe anaemia was also uncertain within 24 hours of transfusion (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.25; 2 trials, 364 participants; very low quality evidence), or at 30-day follow-up (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.31; 1 trial, 290 participants; low quality evidence).Only one trial, in children with severe anaemia (290 participants), reported adverse transfusion reactions. Only one child in each arm experienced an adverse reaction within 24 hours of transfusion.Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration Eleven trials (40,588 participants) compared transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration. Three trials enrolled critically ill term neonates; two of these enrolled very low birth weight neonates. There were no trials in children. Eight trials enrolled critically ill and non-critically ill adults, with most being hospitalised. We judged four trials to be at low risk of bias across all domains with the others having an unclear risk of bias across multiple domains.Transfusion of RBCs of shorter versus standard practice storage duration probably leads to little or no difference in adult in-hospital mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 4 trials, 25,704 participants; moderate quality evidence), ICU mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; 3 trials, 13,066 participants; moderate quality evidence), or 30-day mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13; 4 trials, 7510 participants;moderate quality evidence).Two of the three trials that enrolled neonates reported that there were no adverse transfusion reactions. One trial reported an isolated case of cytomegalovirus infection in participants assigned to the standard practice storage duration group. Two trials in critically ill adults reported data on transfusion reactions: one observed no difference in acute transfusion reactions between arms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.36, 2413 participants), but the other observed more febrile nonhaemolytic reactions in the shorter storage duration arm (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.95, 4919 participants).Trial sequential analysis showed that we may now have sufficient evidence to reject a 5% relative risk increase or decrease of death within 30 days when transfusing RBCs of shorter versus longer storage duration across all patient groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effect of storage duration on clinically important outcomes has now been investigated in large, high quality RCTs, predominantly in adults. There appears to be no evidence of an effect on mortality that is related to length of storage of transfused RBCs. However, the quality of evidence in neonates and children is low. The current practice in blood banks of using the oldest available RBCs can be continued safely. Additional RCTs are not required, but research using alternative study designs, should focus on particular subgroups (e.g. those requiring multiple RBC units) and on factors affecting RBC quality.
29130518	Automated red blood cell exchange in preparation for filgrastim mobilization of autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells in a patient with sickle cell anemia.	Increasing survival of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) well into adulthood results in a rising likelihood of developing hematological malignancy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) rescue is standard of care for several hematological malignancies, but the risk of severe or life-threatening vaso-occlusive phenomena during filgrastim mobilization of HPC for collection poses a potential barrier to this approach. We report the use of automated red cell exchange in preparation for filgrastim mobilization in a patient with homozygous SCA. Red cell exchange was repeated just prior to high-dose chemotherapy to mitigate the need for red cell transfusion during bone marrow reconstitution. The patient experienced no vaso-occlusive phenomena throughout the entire episode of care and did not become iron overloaded. This approach should be considered for all patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous sickle cell disease who are candidates for auto-HPC rescue therapy.
30362236	Virtual reality as complementary pain therapy in hospitalized patients with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Due to incomplete management of vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), we sought to determine if immersive VR would be feasible for inpatients. Secondarily, we hypothesized that a single VR session would improve the VOE pain experience. PROCEDURES: Consecutive patients with SCD eight years and older admitted for VOE were offered one 15-minute VR session, utilizing a relaxing underwater world specifically created for pediatric patients and to minimize potential simulator side effects. Safety and acceptability were evaluated with a brief survey before and after the session. Pain was evaluated utilizing the validated adolescent pediatric pain tool (APPT). Survey data and pain scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test as the data were nonnormally distributed. RESULTS: Thirty patients, 21 female, with a median age of 16 years were enrolled, the majority having hemoglobin SS disease. The VR session had no reported side effects; all patients requested VR again in the future. Median pain intensity (pre-VR 7.3 [interquartile range, IQR, 6.1, 8.8], post-VR 5.8 [4.7, 7.9]), number of affected body areas (pre-VR 3.0 [2.0, 7.8], post-VR 2.0 [0, 4.8]), and qualitative measures including sensory, affective, evaluative, and temporal pain domains were all statistically reduced (i.e., P <=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: VR therapy was feasible in a cohort of patients with SCD admitted for VOE. In addition to standard therapies, VR may help reduce the pain experience with SCD VOE. Further study is required to determine the impact of VR therapy on opioid usage and length of stay in hospital.
31816036	Familial Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant in Children and Adolescents With High-Risk Sickle Cell Disease: A Phase 2 Clinical Trial.	
29792764	Use of a depression and sleep impairment treatment guideline to improve quality of life for patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is often joined by other affective disorders such as depression and/or sleep impairment that can impact pain levels and quality of life (QoL). AIM: To develop a guideline to improve the process of assessment and treatment of depression and sleep impairment in patients admitted with SCD. METHOD: An interdisciplinary team used the Stetler model to create the Guideline for the Evaluation and Treatment of Depression and Sleep Impairment in Sickle Cell Disease. Patients were assessed, offered treatments and reassessed during the project period. RESULTS: Both depression and QoL scores showed significant improvement by the end of the project. Significant correlations were found between pain, depression and sleep; depression, pain, sleep and QoL; sleep, pain and depression; and QoL and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Interdisciplinary teams are effective in creating a guideline to assess and treat depression and sleep impairment and their effects on pain and QoL in patients with SCD.
37248824	Pharmacogenetics of pain management in Zimbabwean patients with sickle cell disease.	Background: Pain is a common cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Failure to effectively control pain remains a challenge in patient care. Materials & methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm  pharmacogenomics open array panel containing CYP2D6 and UGT genetic variants implicated in opioid response. Results: The reduced function alleles CYP2D6*17 and *29 had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. UGT2B7 rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p = 0.0454). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the role of UGT2B7 polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.
31291790	T-cell deplete versus T-cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: where are we?	Introduction: Severe sickle cell disease is associated with progressive end-organ damage and early mortality in adults. While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant from a matched related donor is curative, the vast majority of patients do not have a compatible sibling. Accordingly, platforms using haploidentical donors have been developed, which provide near-universal availability. Areas covered: This review focuses on the two commonly used approaches for haploidentical hematopoietic transplants, namely T-cell deplete and T-cell replete, each of which is associated with unique benefits and drawbacks. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate individualized decision-making for patients and providers by reviewing the pros- and cons of these differing approaches. Expert opinion: Individuals with sickle cell disease eligible for a hematopoietic cell transplant can be considered based on recent results. Comparable outcomes are seen with T-cell deplete and T-cell replete approaches. The choice depends largely on institutional preference.
28005272	Prophylactic versus selective blood transfusion for sickle cell disease in pregnancy.	BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with sickle cell disease (HbSS, HbSC and HbSbetaThal) may require blood transfusion to prevent severe anaemia or to manage potential medical complications. Preventive blood transfusion in the absence of complications starting from the early weeks of pregnancy or blood transfusion only for medical or obstetric indications have been used as management policies. There is currently no consensus on the blood transfusion policy that guarantees optimal clinical benefits with minimal risks for such women and their babies. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of a policy of prophylactic versus selective blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We did not apply any language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of prophylactic versus selective (emergency) blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). Quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Out of six relevant reports identified by the search strategy, one trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) met our inclusion criteria. The trial was at unclear risk of bias. Overall, there were few events for most of the reported outcomes and the results were generally imprecise. The included trial reported no maternal mortality occurring in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. Very low-quality evidence indicated no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 13.22; very low-quality evidence) or markers of severe maternal morbidity (pulmonary embolism (no events); congestive cardiac failure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.38; very low-quality evidence); acute chest syndrome (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.75)) between the treatment groups (prophylactic blood transfusion versus selective blood transfusion). Low-quality evidence indicated that prophylactic blood transfusion reduced the risk of pain crisis compared with selective blood transfusion (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67, one trial, 72 women; low-quality evidence), and no differences in the occurrence of acute splenic sequestration (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.92; low-quality evidence), haemolytic crises (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.06) or delayed blood transfusion reaction (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.39; very low-quality evidence) between the comparison groups.Other relevant maternal outcomes pre-specified for this review such as cumulative duration of hospital stay, postpartum haemorrhage and iron overload, and infant outcomes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and haemolytic disease of the newborn, were not reported by the trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from one small trial of very low quality suggests that prophylactic blood transfusion to pregnant women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) confers no clear clinical benefits when compared with selective transfusion. Currently, there is no evidence from randomised or quasi-randomised trials to provide reliable advice on the optimal blood transfusion policy for women with other variants of sickle cell disease (i.e. HbSC and HbSbetaThal). The available data and quality of evidence on this subject are insufficient to advocate for a change in existing clinical practice and policy.
33229918	HEMOGLOBIN C TRAIT PRESENTING WITH BILATERAL CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION.	PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral sequential, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in a man with newly diagnosed hemoglobin C trait. METHODS: A 67-year-old man presented with a one-month history of declining visual acuity. He was diagnosed with left CRVO. Bilateral temporal retinal ischemia and arteriovenous anastomoses on fluorescein angiography suggestive of sickle cell retinopathy prompted a systemic work-up. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed an underlying hemoglobin C trait. Six-months after his initial presentation, the patient developed symptomatic right CRVO. RESULTS: The initial left CRVO was complicated by optic disc swelling and macular edema. Intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy was initiated and the macular edema resolved. The left eye subsequently developed an epiretinal membrane which was surgically removed. Macular edema in the right eye also resolved after intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of bilateral CRVO in a case of hemoglobin C trait. It is possible that erythrocyte inflexibility, caused by hemoglobin C-induced dehydration and crystallization, acted concomitantly with hypertension to produce occlusive microangiopathy. This case highlights the need for further investigation in patients presenting with central retinal vein occlusion, especially when bilateral, or when retinal angiography reveals bilateral pathology.
36308736	Role of regional anesthesia in patients with acute sickle cell pain: A scoping review.	Sickle cell disease is the most prevalent inherited blood disorder in the world, with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients often have recurrent painful vaso-occlusive episodes, and the American Society of Hematology gives a conditional recommendation for the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell pain management. This scoping review summarizes the current evidence and identifies gaps for future research. Our screening process is outlined, and articles that mentioned the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell crises were included. We present and interpret our results and highlight opportunities for future investigation.
32678452	Effect of Inhaled Cannabis for Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic pain and episodic acute pain caused by vasoocclusive crises, often requiring high doses of opioids for prolonged periods. In humanized mouse models of SCD, a synthetic cannabinoid has been found to attenuate both chronic and acute hyperalgesia. The effect of cannabis on chronic pain in adults with SCD is unknown. Objective: To determine whether inhaled cannabis is more effective than inhaled placebo in relieving chronic pain in adults with SCD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pilot randomized clinical trial included participants with SCD with chronic pain admitted to a single inpatient clinical research center for 2 separate 5-day stays from August 2014 to April 2017. Participants inhaled either vaporized cannabis (4.4% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) 3 times daily or vaporized placebo cannabis. Pain and pain interference ratings using the Brief Pain Inventory were assessed throughout each 5-day period. Participants with SCD and chronic pain on stable analgesics were eligible to enroll. A total of 90 participants were assessed for eligibility; 56 participants were deemed ineligible, and 34 participants were enrolled. Of these, 7 participants dropped out before randomization. Of 27 randomized participants, 23 completed both treatment arms of the crossover study and were included in the final per protocol analysis. Data analysis was completed in June 2019, with the sensitivity analysis conducted in April 2020. Interventions: Inhalation of vaporized cannabis plant (4.4% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) or placebo cannabis plant using a vaporizer 3 times daily for 5 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: Daily pain assessed with visual analog scale and Brief Pain Inventory. Results: A total of 23 participants (mean [SD] age, 37.6 [11.4] years; 13 [56%] women) completed the trial. The mean (SD) difference in pain rating assessment between the cannabis and placebo groups was -5.3 (8.1) for day 1, -10.9 (7.0) for day 2, -16.5 (9.2) for day 3, -8.9 (6.7) for day 4, and -8.2 (8.1) for day 5; however, none of these differences were statistically significant. There was no statistically significant mean (SD) difference in pain interference ratings between cannabis and placebo between days 1 and 5 for interference in general activities (day 1: 0.27 [0.35]; day 5: -1.0 [0.5]), walking (day 1: 0.14 [0.73]; day 5: -0.87 [0.63]), sleep (day 1: 0.59 [0.74]; day 5: -1.3 [0.8]), or enjoyment (day 1: 0.23 [0.69]; day 5: -0.91 [0.48]), but there was a statistically significant mean (SD) difference in decrease in interference with mood (day 1: 0.96 [0.59]; day 5: -1.4 [0.6]; P = .02). No differences in treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Use of concomitant opioids was similar during both treatment periods. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that, compared with vaporized placebo, vaporized cannabis did not statistically significantly reduce pain and associated symptoms, except interference in mood, in patients with SCD with chronic pain. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01771731.
32618750	A Rare Case of Nontraumatic Thoracic Compression Fracture in a 28-Year-Old Man.	ABSTRACT: A 28-yr-old African American man with a history of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome, tobacco use, and sickle cell trait was referred to a physiatrist at a multidisciplinary spine center with a 1-yr history of nontraumatic thoracic back pain that had significantly worsened over the previous 4 wks. In the context of recurrent infections requiring hospital admissions and the patient's immunosuppressed status, magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was obtained, showing an acute or subacute anterior compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body. He was subsequently provided with a hyperextension brace, physical therapy referral, and a trial of intranasal calcitonin. The patient reported significant improvement in pain at his 3-mo follow-up appointment and continued to show pain and functional improvement in physical therapy sessions up to 6 mos later.
37856098	Busulfan and subsequent malignancy: An evidence-based risk assessment.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of secondary malignancies associated with busulfan exposure is considered low, but has been poorly characterized. Because this alkylating agent is increasingly utilized as conditioning prior to gene therapy in nonmalignant hematologic and related disorders, more precise characterization of busulfan's potential contribution to subsequent malignant risk is warranted. PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of busulfan and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on secondary malignancies, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Secondary malignancies were reported in 0.5% of pediatric HCT recipients, with no cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Fatal secondary malignancies were reported in 0.8% of 1887 evaluable adult HCT recipients, and an overall incidence of secondary malignancies of 4.8% was reported in a subset of 389 evaluable adult patients. We also reviewed long-term results from eight publications evaluating lentiviral- and human promotor-based HSC-targeted gene therapy in 215 patients with nonmalignant conditions, in which busulfan/treosulfan monotherapy or busulfan/fludarabine was the only conditioning. Two malignancies were reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), one of which was potentially busulfan-related. No additional malignancies were reported in 173 patients with follow-up of 5-12 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of busulfan-related secondary malignancies is low, and likely to be substantially less than 1% in pediatric transplant recipients, especially those receiving busulfan monotherapy for nonmalignant conditions other than SCD.
36569951	Donor chimerism and immune reconstitution following haploidentical transplantation in sickle cell disease.	Introduction: We previously reported the initial results of a phase II multicenter transplant trial using haploidentical parental donors for children and aolescents with high-risk sickle cell disease achieving excellent survival with exceptionally low rates of graft-versus-host disease and resolution of sickle cell disease symptoms. To investigate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization, graft characteristics, donor chimerism, and immune reconstitution in these recipients. Methods: CD34 cells were enriched using the CliniMACS  system with a target dose of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) addback dose of 2x105 CD3/kg in the final product. Pre-transplant HLA antibodies were characterized. Donor chimerism was monitored 1-24 months post-transplant. Comprehensive assessment of immune reconstitution included lymphocyte subsets, plasma cytokines, complement levels, anti-viral T-cell responses, activation markers, and cytokine production. Infections were monitored. Results: HLA antibodies were detected in 7 of 11 (64%) evaluable patients but rarely were against donor antigens. Myeloid engraftment was rapid (100%) at a median of 9 days. At 30 days, donor chimerism was 93-99% and natural killer cell levels were restored. By 60 days, CD19 B cells were normal. CD8 and CD4 T-cells levels were normal by 279 and 365 days, respectively. Activated CD4 and CD8 T-cells were elevated at 100-365 days post-transplant while naive cells remained below baseline. Tregs were elevated at 100-270 days post-transplant, returning to baseline levels at one year. At one year, C3 and C4 levels were above baseline and CH50 levels were near baseline. At one year, cytokine levels were not significantly different from baseline. Discussion: These results suggest that haploidentical transplantation with CD34-enriched cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cell addback results in rapid engraftment, sustained donor chimerism and broad-based immune reconstitution.
34047257	Gene Therapy as the New Frontier for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation results in polymerization of hemoglobin (Hb) under reduced oxygenation conditions, causing rigid sickle-shaped RBCs and hemolytic anemia. This clearly defined fundamental molecular mechanism makes SCD a prototypical target for precision therapy. Both the mutant beta-globin protein and its downstream pathophysiology are pharmacological targets of intensive research. SCD also is a disease well-suited for biological interventions like gene therapy. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation and gene therapy platforms, like Lentiviral vectors and gene editing strategies, expand the potentially curative options for patients with SCD. This review discusses the recent advances in precision therapy for SCD and the preclinical and clinical advances in autologous HSC gene therapy for SCD.
36355034	Unique approaches for testicular shielding during total-body irradiation for pediatric patients.	Total-body irradiation (TBI) has been used as a part of the conditioning regimen for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for certain nonmalignant conditions such as sickle cell disease. Although effective, TBI can cause lasting side effects for pediatric patients. One of these potential side effects includes oligospermia or even permanent azoospermia. Although many investigators have studied ways to shield the testicles during the TBI for nonmalignant conditions, there is no set standard. We describe the technical aspects of effective techniques to shield the testicles of male pediatric patients undergoing TBI. We verified that our techniques reduced the testicular dose by approximately 80%-85% of the TBI prescription dose in four male pediatric patients, keeping the dose well below the documented doses that can cause permanent infertility and hypogonadism.
28880867	Oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine for non-cytotoxic epigenetic gene regulation in sickle cell disease: A randomized phase 1 study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a congenital hemolytic anemia that exacts terrible global morbidity and mortality, is driven by polymerization of mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in red blood cells (RBCs). Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) interferes with this polymerization, but HbF is epigenetically silenced from infancy onward by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). METHODS AND FINDINGS: To pharmacologically re-induce HbF by DNMT1 inhibition, this first-in-human clinical trial (NCT01685515) combined 2 small molecules-decitabine to deplete DNMT1 and tetrahydrouridine (THU) to inhibit cytidine deaminase (CDA), the enzyme that otherwise rapidly deaminates/inactivates decitabine, severely limiting its half-life, tissue distribution, and oral bioavailability. Oral decitabine doses, administered after oral THU 10 mg/kg, were escalated from a very low starting level (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, or 0.16 mg/kg) to identify minimal doses active in depleting DNMT1 without cytotoxicity. Patients were SCD adults at risk of early death despite standard-of-care, randomized 3:2 to THU-decitabine versus placebo in 5 cohorts of 5 patients treated 2X/week for 8 weeks, with 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary endpoint was >= grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity. This endpoint was not triggered, and adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different in THU-decitabine-versus placebo-treated patients. At the decitabine 0.16 mg/kg dose, plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 50 nM (Cmax) and remained elevated for several hours. This dose decreased DNMT1 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by >75% and repetitive element CpG methylation by approximately 10%, and increased HbF by 4%-9% (P < 0.001), doubling fetal hemoglobin-enriched red blood cells (F-cells) up to approximately 80% of total RBCs. Total hemoglobin increased by 1.2-1.9 g/dL (P = 0.01) as reticulocytes simultaneously decreased; that is, better quality and efficiency of HbF-enriched erythropoiesis elevated hemoglobin using fewer reticulocytes. Also indicating better RBC quality, biomarkers of hemolysis, thrombophilia, and inflammation (LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein [CRP]) improved. As expected with non-cytotoxic DNMT1-depletion, platelets increased and neutrophils concurrently decreased, but not to an extent requiring treatment holds. As an early phase study, limitations include small patient numbers at each dose level and narrow capacity to evaluate clinical benefits. CONCLUSION: Administration of oral THU-decitabine to patients with SCD was safe in this study and, by targeting DNMT1, upregulated HbF in RBCs. Further studies should investigate clinical benefits and potential harms not identified to date. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01685515.
33216975	Improved stenosis outcome in stroke-free sickle cell anemia children after transplantation compared to chronic transfusion.	We report here the 3-year stenosis outcome in 60 stroke-free children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and an abnormal transcranial Doppler history, enrolled in the DREPAGREFFE trial, which compared stem cell transplantation (SCT) with standard-care (chronic transfusion for 1-year minimum). Twenty-eight patients with matched sibling donors were transplanted, while 32 remained on standard-care. Stenosis scores were calculated after performing cerebral/cervical 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. Fourteen patients had stenosis at enrollment, but only five SCT versus 10 standard-care patients still had stenosis at 3 years. Stenosis scores remained stable on standard-care, but significantly improved after SCT (P = 0 006). No patient developed stenosis after SCT, while two on standard-care did, indicating better stenosis prevention and improved outcome after SCT.
38000628	Gene-addition/editing therapy in sickle cell disease.	Gene therapy is an innovative strategy that offers potential cure for patients with sickle cell disease, and no appropriate donor for transplant consideration. While we await long term data from these clinical trials, we remain optimistic that gene therapy will become a standard of care for curative treatment in sickle cell disease. As gene therapy becomes a standard of treatment in sickle cell disease, we must also acknowledge the potential for financial burden to patients. We also must acknowledge the prevalence of sickle cell disease in low-resource settings. Hopefully, as we learn more about gene therapy, we can assess ways to overcome the financial toxicity that comes with this therapy.
32459595	Outcomes of a preoperative risk-based transfusion assignment protocol in sickle cell disease patients: a single-center retrospective study from Saudi Arabia.	Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) need surgical management during their lifetime. The best approach for preoperative transfusion in SCD is still to be determined. In this single-center retrospective study, we included HBSS/HBS-Beta0-thalassemia patients younger than 16 years of age who underwent surgery between January 2008 and July 2019. Preoperative transfusion assignment (PTA) was based on SCD severity and surgical risk. Patients were assigned to no transfusion, simple transfusion, or exchange transfusion. A total of 284 patients were identified and 66 (23%) underwent 78 procedures. Mean age at the time of procedure was 8 (5-11) years, mean baseline hemoglobin was 8.5 (7.8-9.3) g/dl, and mean hemoglobin F was 18.4 +- 8.2%. SCD severity was low-risk in 57 (73%) and high-risk in 21 (27%) patients. Surgical risk was low-risk in 20 (25.6%) and medium-risk in 58 (74.4%) procedures. PTA was no transfusion in 17 (22%), simple transfusion in 40 (51%), and exchange transfusion in 21 (27%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred in five (6.4%) of procedures only in the simple transfusion group (three acute chest syndrome, one hemolytic anemia, one pain crisis) undergoing medium-risk surgery. Preoperative risk-based transfusion assignment is feasible. Despite a high baseline hemoglobin level in the no transfusion group, none of the patients developed postoperative complications. It is possible that the high baseline hemoglobin F phenotype was protective and indicates the need to study the risk/benefit of interventions used in this phenotype.
36583467	Individual-level behavioral interventions to support optimal development of children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	This review aimed to identify and describe individual-level behavioral interventions for children 0-18 years of age with sickle cell disease (SCD). PRISMA guidelines were followed at each stage of this review. Twenty-seven studies were included, representing six intervention types: disease knowledge (n = 7), self-management (n = 7), pain management (n = 4), school functioning (n = 4), cognitive health (n = 4), and mental health (n = 2). Most interventions targeted older children (5+ years), while only two examined interventions for children 0-3 years. This review suggests that offering education about disease knowledge, self-management, and pain management interventions can be beneficial for this population. Future research is needed to understand interventions to support young children and the impact of SCD on development.
32470197	Non-myeloablative matched sibling stem cell transplantation with the optional reinforced stem cell infusion for patients with hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: The NIH protocol for non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with alemtuzumab and low-dose total body irradiation corrected the abnormal sickle cell disease (SCD) phenotype without the risk of graft-versus-host disease. However, alloSCT using NMA conditioning had been rarely applied to beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. METHODS: To avoid prolonged immunosuppression, we developed a two-stage strategy. Mixed donor chimerism was initially achieved using the protocol developed by the NIH protocol. Thereafter, we facilitated donor chimerism using the optional reinforced stem cell (SC) infusion in cases requiring protracted immunosuppression or experiencing impending graft failure. RESULTS: In this study, beta-TM (n = 9) and SCD (n = 4) patients were equally effectively treated with eradicating the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype. Five patients, including four beta-TM, achieved stable mixed chimerism without receiving optional reinforced SC infusion. All patients that received optional reinforced infusion achieved complete (n = 4) or mixed chimerism (n = 1). The overall survival rate and event-free survival at 4 years were 91.7% (95% CI; 53.9-98.8) in both groups, with a thalassemia-free survival rate in beta-TM patients of 87.5% (95% CI; 38.7-98.1). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report successful NMA conditioning alloSCT to achieve stable mixed chimerism correcting the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype in adult beta-TM patients.
32234293	Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency in Latin America.	OBJECTIVE: Venous disease is common in Latin America, with an estimated 68.11% prevalence of chronic venous disease. The diverse social, political, and economic characteristics of the many nations that make up Latin America mean that different conditions affect how these diseases are diagnosed and treated, which may differ markedly from the way they are treated by the health care systems of the United States and Europe. Our goal was to review the current state of treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in Latin America. METHODS: This is a narrative review of the medical literature on the subject and synthesizes sometimes fragmentary information on CVI across a large and diverse region. RESULTS: CVI represents an unmet medical need in Latin America. Conservative treatments, such as compression stockings, may be used at first, and there are nonpharmacologic and complementary and alternative medicine approaches in use. Endovenous approaches, such as endovenous thermal ablation, have largely replaced surgical interventions. In Europe and the United States, such procedures are mainly carried out in ambulatory facilities, whereas they are mainly performed in the hospital in Latin America. CONCLUSIONS: Recent strong economic growth in Latin America and improvements in social security and health care suggest that innovative approaches to chronic venous disease and CVI will be implemented.
37976218	Simultaneous Robotic-Assisted Splenectomy and Cholecystectomy in Children: Is It Safe and Effective?	Background: Hematologic conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura are frequently linked to cholelithiasis. In instances where symptoms are present, simultaneous cholecystectomy and splenectomy are commonly recommended. Our aim was to assess the outcomes of robotic-assisted procedures conducted for simultaneous surgical issues involving the spleen and gallbladder in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: We have made a simultaneous retrospective study of children with hereditary hematological diseases who underwent combined robotic-assisted splenectomy and cholecystectomy at our institution from January 2010 to December 2021. Demographics, clinical features, intraoperative data, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 11 patients (6 male; 5 female) were included, with a mean age of 13.9 +- 4.4 years (range 8-17). Hereditary spherocytosis was the most common disease (7 cases), followed by sick cell disease (4 cases), with associated symptomatic gallbladder litiasis in all of them. Both operations were carried out using the da Vinci  Surgical Si System in a single docking robotic platform (four robotic arms). Median total surgery time was 145 minutes (Q1-Q3: 115-162). Minimal intraoperative bleeding was recorded (mean 45 +- 15 mL), with no intraoperative complications or conversion. Median length of hospital stay was 3 days (Q1-Q3: 2-4). There were no cases of surgical wound infections or postoperative bleeding documented. Conclusion: Simultaneous robotic-assisted splenectomy and cholecystectomy can be considered safe and feasible interventions in children with hematological diseases that affect both the spleen and the gallbladder. However, further research is needed to enhance the existing evidence and establish a standardized approach.
38247082	The bold promise of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	
30541465	Safety and effectiveness of antimalarial therapy in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: About 80% of all reported sickle cell disease (SCD) cases in children anually are recorded in Africa. Although malaria is considered a major cause of death in SCD children, there is limited data on the safety and effectiveness of the available antimalarial drugs used for prophylaxis. Also, previous systematic reviews have not provided quantitative measures of preventive effectiveness. The purpose of this research was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the safety and effectiveness of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis used in SCD patients. METHODS: We searched in PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, POPLine and Cochrane library, for the period spanning January 1990 to April 2018. We considered randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis to, 1) other antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, 2) placebo or 3) no intervention, in SCD patients. Studies comparing at least two treatment arms, for a minimum duration of three months, with no restriction on the number of patients per arm were reviewed. The data were extracted and expressed as odds ratios. Direct pairwise comparisons were performed using fixed effect models and the heterogeneity assessed using the I-square. RESULTS: Six qualified studies that highlighted the importance of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis in SCD children were identified. In total, seven different interventions (Chloroquine, Mefloquine, Mefloquine artesunate, Proguanil, Pyrimethamine, Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine amodiaquine) were evaluated in 912 children with SCD. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that antimalarial chemoprophylaxis provided protection against parasitemia and clinical malaria episodes in children with SCD. Nevertheless, the risk of hospitalization (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.267-1.959; I2 = 0.0%), blood transfusion (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.542-1.280; I2 = 29.733%), vaso-occlusive crisis (OR = 19, 95% CI = 1.713-2.792; I2 = 93.637%), and mortality (OR = 0.511, 95% CI = 0.189-1.384; I2 = 0.0%) did not differ between the intervention and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The data shows that antimalarial prophylaxis reduces the incidence of clinical malaria in children with SCD. However, there was no difference between the occurrence of adverse events in children who received placebo and those who received prophylaxis. This creates an urgent need to assess the efficacy of new antimalarial drug regimens as potential prophylactic agents in SCD patients. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42016052514).
38466269	Opioid Prescribing and Outcomes in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Post-2016 CDC Guideline.	Importance: Although the intention of the 2016 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain was not to limit pain treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), clinicians and patients have recognized the possibility that the guideline may have altered outcomes for this population. However, the outcomes of the 2016 guideline for this patient population are unknown. Objective: To examine changes in opioid prescribing patterns and health outcomes among patients with SCD before and after the release of the 2016 CDC guideline. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted interrupted time series analysis of claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019. In this population-based study in the US, individuals with SCD who were at least 1 year of age, had no cancer diagnosis, and had pharmacy coverage for the month of measurement were included. The data were analyzed from January 2021 to November 2023. Exposure: The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain released in March 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main variables measured in this study included the practice of opioid prescribing among patients with SCD (ie, rate of opioid prescriptions dispensed, mean number of days supplied, mean total morphine milligram equivalents [MME] per patient, and mean daily MME per opioid prescription) and pain-related health outcomes (rates of emergency department visits related to vaso-occlusive crises [VOC] and hospitalizations related to VOC). Results: The cohort included 14 979 patients with SCD (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [16.9] years; 8520 [56.9%] female). Compared with the preguideline trends, the following changes were observed after the guideline was released: significant decreases in the coefficient for change in slope of the opioid dispensing rate (-0.29 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.20] prescriptions per 100 person-month; P < .001), the number of days supplied per prescription (-0.05 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.04] days per prescription-month; P < .001), and opioid dosage (-141.0 [95% CI, -219.5 to -62.5] MME per person-month; P = .001; -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.6] MME/prescription-month; P < .001). Conversely, a significant increase in VOC-related hospitalizations occurred after the guideline release (0.16 [95% CI, 0.07-0.25] hospitalizations per 100 person-month; P = .001). These changes were observed to a greater extent among adult patients, but pediatric patients experienced similar changes in several measures, even though the guideline focused exclusively on adult patients. Conclusions and Relevance: This retrospective cohort study showed that the 2016 CDC guideline may have had unintended negative outcomes on the patient population living with SCD.
38069526	Euvolemic automated transfusion to treat severe anemia in sickle cell disease patients at risk of circulatory overload.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. RESULTS: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD +- 1.6%) and 29.1% (SD +- 1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
29061531	Outcomes of Unrelated Donor Stem Cell Transplantion with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis in Patients with Severe Sickle Cell Disease.	Unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a high incidence of rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We report on the first 4 patients with severe SCD who underwent URD HCT using a novel myeloablative and immunosuppressive regimen composed of busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin with a single dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. Three patients engrafted and remain disease-free after a median follow-up period of 2.5 years. One patient had primary graft failure attributed to low stem cell content of the graft. Of interest, none of the engrafted patients developed acute or chronic GVHD. This preparative regimen along with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide offers a promising approach for unrelated donor transplants in patients with SCD and needs further corroboration in larger number of patients.
29475609	Moya-Moya syndrome after cranial radiation for optic glioma with NF1. Case report and literature review of syndromic cases.	INTRODUCTION: Moya-Moya angiopathy is a neurovascular disease that predisposes to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. It is generated by a steno-occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries, which induces the development of abnormal neovessels in the deep regions of the brain. Some pathologies such as sickle cell disease, Down syndrome or Graves' disease may be associated with Moya-Moya angiopathy. These syndromic forms harbor several differences compared with idiopathic Moya-Moya disease. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a young patient who presented with a syndromic form of Moya-Moya angiopathy after cranial radiation therapy for an optic glioma associated with type 1 neurofibromatosis treated by combined revascularization. We discuss the particularities of syndromic forms, in their presentation and management based on a review of the literature. CONCLUSION: Many diseases can be associated with Moya-Moya syndrome. Symptomatic patients should undergo surgery, but the risk of postoperative complications appears to be greater than that encountered in patients with non-syndromic Moya-Moya angiopathy.
36354234	Safety of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in 213 adult patients with sickle cell disease.	Given the lack of information about safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we sought to determine whether COVID-19 vaccine was associated with subsequent hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). We included 402 patients with SCD, including 88 regularly transfused. As of July 31, 2021, 213 (53.0%) of them had received a least one dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer 93.0%). We showed similar risk of hospital admission for a VOE among vaccinated patients (whether transfused or not) and among a control group of non-vaccinated patients matched for age, sex and genotype.
30951025	Effect of Sickle Cell Anemia Therapies on the Natural History of Growth and Puberty Patterns.	As pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have impaired growth and puberty patterns, we studied the effect of disease-modifying therapies on growth and puberty patterns for patients with SCA receiving hydroxyurea (HU), transfusions, or no therapy. We performed a retrospective study of children with SCA in whom anthropometric measurements and therapy type were recorded. Penalized smoothing splines were fitted to estimate growth curves and growth velocity, and linear mixed models were used to examine differences across treatment groups. Across group analyses were divided into early childhood (4.0 to 7.9 y) and peripubertal (8.0 to 12.0 y). We analyzed growth data on 157 SCA patients. From 8.0 to 12.0 years, girls on transfusion therapy were significantly taller than girls on HU (range, 5.7 to 7.2 cm; P-value range 0.002 to 0.01). From 10.0 to 12.0 years, boys on transfusion therapy were significantly taller than boys on HU (range, 4.1 to 9.4 cm; P-value range <0.0001 to 0.04). In addition, boys on transfusion therapy had an earlier peak height velocity as compared with boys on either HU or no therapy. In conclusion, children receiving transfusions tended to be taller than children on HU or no therapy. Children on HU did not demonstrate superior growth pattern when compared with children on no therapy in the peripubertal years.
38066846	Logistics, risks, and benefits of automated red blood cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions treat and prevent severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and can be delivered as a simple or exchange transfusion. During an exchange, some of the patient's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing patient's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for patients with SCD who require transfusion.
33296531	Matched sibling donor stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: Results from the Spanish group for bone marrow transplantation in children.	OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) in Spain is markedly inferior compared with other European and Mediterranean countries. However, the diagnosis of new patients with SCD is expected to increase. In this multicenter retrospective study, we analyze the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) results obtained in Spain. METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent a matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT between 1999 and 2018 were included. Primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), and secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Bone marrow was the most frequent stem cell source (93.3%). Most patients received a conditioning regimen based on busulfan and cyclophosphamide (69%). Cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD was 6.8% (95% CI: 2.3%-20.1%) and 5.4% (95% CI: 1.38%-19.9%), respectively. EFS and overall survival (OS) at 3 years post-HSCT were 89.4% (95% CI: 73.9%-95.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI: 77.2%-97.4%), respectively. All patients aged <= 5 presented 100% EFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: An early referral to HSCT centers should be proposed early in life, before severe complications occur. MSD HSCT should be considered a curative option for all patients aged <= 5 years and for older pediatric patients who present complications derived from the disease.
32604335	Potential Risk Factors Associated With Graft Failure of Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	Nonmyeloablative (NMA) haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease has significantly increased donor availability for transplant and is increasingly used as curative treatment. The authors describe 3 pediatric patients who rejected grafts after an NMA regimen, previously reported to result in good engraftment rates in the mainly adult population. In this manuscript, potential factors contributing to rejection are described and discussed. The authors emphasize the need to further optimize the NMA regimens in pediatric patients and perform haploidentical transplants for sickle cell disease on clinical trials.
29574950	Automated RBC exchange compared to manual exchange transfusion for children with sickle cell disease is cost-effective and reduces iron overload.	BACKGROUND: Chronic transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) remains the gold standard therapy for stroke prevention and for patients with severe disease despite adequate hydroxyurea treatment. The aim of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of automated red blood cell exchange (aRBX) in patients with SCD previously treated with manual exchange transfusion (MET). Costs related to transfusion and chelation overtime were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Beginning in January 2012, children with SCD who weighed 30 kg or more on MET could switch to aRBX. Clinical, biological, and procedures' data, including costs, were recorded for the last 6 months on MET and compared to those after the first and the second year on aRBX. RESULTS: Ten patients switched from MET to aRBX at a median age of 11.8 years. After the switch, median hemoglobin S (HbS) increased significantly (33.5% on MET compared to 45% on aRBX; p < 0.001) but remained in the target values for all patients. Median ferritin decreased significantly (663.3 microg/L on MET compared to 126.8 microg/L on aRBX; p < 0.001) and intervals between procedures were significantly longer. The requirements of red blood cells (RBCs)/kg/year were not different on MET (0.88 unit/kg/year) than during the second year on aRBX (1.07 unit/kg/year; p = NS). MET costs were similar compared to aRBX since chelation was stopped in previously treated patients. CONCLUSION: Erythrocytapheresis reduces iron overload and allows a longer interval between procedures without a higher RBC requirement from the second year on aRBX. The cost did not increase as estimated in our Belgian Health Care System.
31593753	Opioid treatment for acute and chronic pain in patients with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is a uniquely complex painful disease, with lifelong episodes of unpredictable acute pain and superimposed chronic pain in adulthood. Both painful crises and chronic pain in sickle cell disease lack strong objective pathological correlates and their mechanisms are poorly understood. Opioids have emerged as the standard of care for severe acute pain in sickle cell disease and many patients with chronic pain are maintained on chronic opioid therapy. The strong association between recurrent acute pain and chronic pain in SCD blurs the distinction between acute and chronic opioid management paradigms. In addition, opioid management for SCD is dogged by stigma and concerns regarding addiction. This review aims to synthesize the broad literature on opioids to highlight the clinical complexity of opioid management in sickle cell disease and suggest directions for future research and clinical innovation.
29357790	A New Era for Hemoglobinopathies: More Than One Curative Option.	Hemoglobinopathies, including severe beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, represent the most common monogenic disorders worldwide. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the only approved curative option for these syndromes, albeit limited to patients having a suitable donor. Gene therapy, by making use of the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells to introduce a normal copy of the beta-globin gene by viral vectors, bridged the gap between the need for cure of patients with hemoglobinopathies and the lack of a donor, without incurring the immunological risks of allo-HSCT. However, gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies proved a difficult and elusive goal for decades and only recently, lenti-viral vector gene therapy was successfully transferred to the clinic. Importantly, during the last years, additional curative options for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease are being developed, based on the ability to manipulate the genome by employing programmable nucleases and next-generation genome-modifying tools, thus providing the exciting prospects of targeted in-situ gene correction. In this review, we will summarize current developments in the new era of treatment for hemoglobinopathies, elaborate on lessons gained from gene therapy trials and discuss the exciting prospects and challenges of genome editing.
30879904	Recommendations for the use of red blood cell exchange in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterised by a single mutation of the beta globin gene, causing the production of an abnormal haemoglobin called sickle haemoglobin (HbS). In its deoxygenated form, HbS polymerises, causing major rheological disorders, which presents clinically as periodic vaso-occlusive crises, chronic haemolysis and chronic vascular dysfunction. Patients often resort to a background treatment, and transfusion remains the cornerstone in the management of the disease, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The aim of red blood cell exchange (RBCX) is to improve tissue oxygenation by increasing haemoglobin levels while lowering HbS levels. RBCX can be performed by manual or automated exchange, and each technique has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This article will outline the transfusion indications for the main complications of SCD, as well as the most appropriate strategy to use.
30910616	Selecting red blood cell units to perform RBCX in patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell exchange (RBCX) is a standard option for treating or preventing complications in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). According to the patient's blood volume, the amounts of red blood cells (RBC) to be exchanged and the practices of the apheresis and clinical teams, such treatment requires numerous red blood cell units (RBCUs) (3-15 RBCUs per procedure). To perform RBCXs safely and prevent the risk of alloimmunization, appropriate RBCUs must be selected and transfused to replace the sickled RBCs. Understanding of alloimmunization in patients with SCD strengthened the development of recommendations for preventing the risk of alloimmunization. This review describes the alloimmunization risk, the methods used to decrease the risk, and our own experience.
29880248	Red cell transfusion in paediatric patients with thalassaemia and sickle cell disease: Current status, challenges and perspectives.	Notwithstanding the high safety level of the currently available blood for transfusion and the decreasing frequency of transfusion-related complications, administration of labile blood products to paediatric patients still poses unique challenges and considerations. The incidence of thalassaemia and sickle cell disease in the paediatric population may be high enough under specific racial and geographical contexts. Red cell transfusion is the cornerstone of beta-thalassaemia treatment and one of the most effective ways to prevent or correct specific acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. However, this life-saving strategy comes with its own complications, such as additional iron overload, alloimmunization and haemolytic reactions, among others. In paediatrics, the dependency of the transfusion outcome upon disease and other recipient characteristics is more prominent compared with the adults, owing to differences in developmental maturity and physiology that render them more susceptible to common risks, exacerbate the host response to transfused cells, and modify the type or the clinical severity of the transfusion-related morbidity. The adverse branch of red cell transfusion is likely the overall effect of several factors acting synergistically to shape the clinical phenotype of this therapy, including inherent donor/blood unit variables, like antigenicity, red cell deformability and extracellular vesicles, as well as recipient variables, such as history of alloimmunization and inflammation level at time of transfusion. This review focuses on paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease as a recipient group with distinct transfusion-related characteristics, and introduces new concepts for consideration, not adequately studied and elucidated so far.
