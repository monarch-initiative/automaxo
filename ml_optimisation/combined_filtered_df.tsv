21992158	Treatment of chronic chest wall pain in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome using spinal cord stimulation. OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used with increased frequency for the treatment of intractable pain including chronic chest pain. METHODS: The patient with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain underwent an uneventful SCS trial with percutaneous epidural placement of two temporary eight-electrode leads placed at the level of T3-T4-T5. RESULTS: After experiencing excellent pain relief over the next two days, the patient was implanted with permanent leads and rechargeable generator four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief at 12-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: SCS provides an effective, alternative treatment option for select patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain who have failed conservative treatment. SCS may provide pain relief with advantages over conservative treatments and more invasive techniques.
24045763	A patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated with chemoradiotherapy for an oropharyngeal carcinoma. We present the first published case of a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) who was treated with radical chemoradiotherapy for an oropharyngeal carcinoma. In view of this newly recognised connective tissue disease, the uncertainty of severe toxicity from chemoradiotherapy to treat a potentially curative cancer posed a management challenge. The patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy and remains well with no evidence of recurrence at 3 years. Furthermore, we have observed minimal late effects secondary to chemoradiotherapy at 3 years following the completion of treatment suggesting that the underlying pathogenesis of LDS may provide an interesting human model to further elucidate the complex interactions of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and tissue fibrosis secondary to chemoradiotherapy. A review of LDS as well as the association of TGF-beta1 expression and tissue fibrosis is presented. 
25203753	Hemodynamic instability during anesthesia in an adolescent with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: a case report. We present a case of a 12-year-old male with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), a rare life-threatening genetic disorder. Multiple manifestations of LDS were present, including easy bruising, aortic root dilatation, multiple areas of vessel tortuosity, and joint laxity. The patient's medications included a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist for prophylaxis against further aortic root dilatation due to his LDS. He experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability and became pulseless during an orthopedic procedure, which had to be abandoned. Anesthesia was reattempted 2 days after cessation of the patient's antihypertensive medications and was successful with only minor postoperative hypertension. 
29889773	Spondylolisthesis is Common, Early, and Severe in Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. BACKGROUND: We studied the prevalence and treatment outcomes of spondylolisthesis in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). METHODS: Clinical data and lumbosacral imaging of 138 patients with LDS were reviewed. Spondylolisthesis (L4-L5 or L5-S1) and spondylolysis were characterized by multimodal imaging and correlated with clinical data. Treatments and outcomes were characterized for patients with spondylolisthesis. Associations were determined using the Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, and Student t tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (17%) had spondylolysis and 23 (17%) had spondylolisthesis. Median age at spondylolisthesis diagnosis was 11 (interquartile range, 9.5) years. In patients in whom measurement was possible (n=20), mean (+-SD) slip was 48% (+-35%). Nineteen patients had L5-S1 slip and 4 had L4-L5 slip. Of the patients with spondylolisthesis, 5 had no evidence of spondylolysis; of those with spondylolysis, all but 6 had spondylolisthesis. Eleven patients with spondylolisthesis underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) to treat slip progression, pain, and/or neurological deficit. Spondylolisthesis recurred in 1 patient who underwent PSF with bone graft arthrodesis alone (no instrumentation). The other 10 patients underwent PSF with instrumentation and fusion. Three patients additionally underwent Bohlman interbody fusion. Two patients developed implant failure. S2 fixation was performed at revision to achieve fusion in these patients. Mean Meyerding grade improved in patients who underwent arthrodesis, from 3.9 (+-1.2) to 1.9 (+-1.3) (P=0.002). Complications were 2 cerebrospinal fluid leaks, 2 transient postoperative paresthesias, and 1 case each of pseudarthrosis at S1-S2, wound dehiscence, and transient urinary incontinence. No significant associations between LDS type and lumbosacral abnormalities were found. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis is common in LDS and usually associated with spondylolysis. Patients requiring surgery for spondylolisthesis present during childhood and do well after instrumented PSF. Interbody fusion and stabilization of S1 and S2 can prevent physeal deformation. LDS should be considered in patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis. Patients with LDS should be monitored for spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis starting when they are young. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-retrospective study.
23350955	Imaging and percutaneous occlusion of a large aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus in an infant with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Loeys-Dietz is a multisystem congenital syndrome that comprises craniofacial and cutaneous abnormalities as well as structural cardiac defects. One of its key pathological features is an aggressive widespread vasculopathy that can manifest as aortic or cerebral aneurysms, which is prone to dissection and rupture. We report a case of a large aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, successfully occluded by interventional catheterization. 
29350591	Clip ligation for ruptured intracranial aneurysm in a child with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: case report. The authors present the case of a pediatric patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) who underwent craniotomy for clip ligation of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. To the authors' knowledge, this is the youngest reported patient with LDS who has been treated for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. The patient presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage even though the results of surveillance screening were negative, and the aneurysm arose from the wall of the parent artery away from an arterial branch point. She was treated with open clip ligation and recovered well. The authors review the other reported cases of treated intracranial aneurysms in patients with LDS.
24395868	Cerebral arterial angioplasty in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. A 14-year-old boy with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) had an acute neurologic decline 6 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography at presentation did not show an aneurysmal source of the hemorrhage. However, on post-bleed day 6 the patient experienced an acutely worsening headache and subsequently lost consciousness. Head CT showed new subarachnoid blood and repeat angiography demonstrated a basilar tip aneurysm. Endovascular coil embolization was performed and his neurologic status improved postoperatively until post-bleed day 9 when he became unresponsive. A CT angiogram demonstrated severe proximal vasospasm. After an unsuccessful attempt to treat the vasospasm medically, the patient was transported to the neurointerventional suite for intra-arterial vasodilator treatment, which also failed to ameliorate the vasospasm. The endovascular surgeons were then faced with the conundrum of attempting a high-risk cerebral angioplasty in a pediatric patient with LDS or returning to maximal medical treatment for severe refractory vasospasm. 
31842932	Oral health-related quality of life in Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a rare connective tissue disorder: an observational cohort study. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder whose oral manifestations and dental phenotypes have not been well-characterized. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of oral manifestations on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in LDS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LDS subjects were assessed by the craniofacial team at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Dental Clinic between June 2015 and January 2018. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire, oral health self-care behavior questionnaire and a comprehensive dental examination were completed for each subject. OHRQoL was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire with higher scores corresponding to worse OHRQoL. Regression models were used to determine the relationship between each oral manifestation and the OHIP-14 scores using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 33 LDS subjects (51.5% female) aged 3-57 years (19.6 +- 15.1 years) were included in the study. The OHIP-14 scores (n = 33) were significantly higher in LDS subjects (6.30 [SD 6.37]) when compared to unaffected family member subjects (1.50 [SD 2.28], p < 0.01), and higher than the previously reported scores of the general U.S. population (2.81 [SD 0.12]). Regarding oral health self-care behavior (n = 32), the majority of LDS subjects reported receiving regular dental care (81%) and maintaining good-to-excellent daily oral hygiene (75%). Using a crude regression model, worse OHRQoL was found to be associated with dental hypersensitivity (beta = 5.24; p < 0.05), temporomandibular joints (TMJ) abnormalities (beta = 5.92; p < 0.01), self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 6.77; p < 0.01), and cumulation of four or more oral manifestations (beta = 7.23; p < 0.001). Finally, using a parsimonious model, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 5.87; p < 0.01) and TMJ abnormalities (beta = 4.95; p < 0.01) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The dental hypersensitivity, TMJ abnormalities, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status and cumulation of four-or-more oral manifestations had significant influence on worse OHRQoL. Specific dental treatment guidelines are necessary to ensure optimal quality of life in patients diagnosed with LDS.
28604473	Perioperative Anesthetic Management for Cesarean Delivery in a Parturient With Type IV Loeys-Dietz Syndrome: A Case Report. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder predisposing to aortic and arterial aneurysms. Presentations are classified into subtypes based on gene mutations. Pregnancy in patients with LDS is considered very high risk due to the potential for aortic dissection and uterine rupture. We report successful management of an elective cesarean delivery in a 16-year-old patient with LDS type IV using epidural anesthesia. Perioperative considerations and multidisciplinary management specific to taking care of parturients with LDS are discussed.
24399673	Percutanous closure of left ventricular aneurysms in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We report a case of percutaneous closure of multiple left ventricular aneurysms in a patient with inherited aortic-aneurysm syndrome-the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. One aneurysm was a true aneurysm in the subaortic region and the second one was a pseudoaneurysm at the left ventricular apex. The patient was a high-risk candidate for repeated operations. Both aneurysms were closed successfully percutaneously in staged procedures. There were no complications. The patient remained clinically well with stable echocardiographic results upon reassessment. This case illustrated that catheter-based closure of left ventricular aneurysms is a feasible approach in the context of connective tissue abnormalities related to the Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
21801912	Valve-sparing aortic root replacement in Loeys-Dietz syndrome. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized aggressive aortic disorder characterized by root aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate. The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score 7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.
25323276	Curative reconstruction of a cerebral aneurysm by flow diversion with the Pipeline embolisation device in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently described connective tissue disorder with a natural history of extreme vessel tortuosity and aggressive arterial aneurysm formation and rupture. This is the case of a 23-year-old woman with a large, dysplastic cavernous aneurysm who had successful endovascular treatment by flow diversion with the Pipeline embolisation device. Ten-month follow-up demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion and curative reconstruction of the parent vessel without evidence of vessel injury or dissection. Endovascular treatment with flow-diverting devices is a valid treatment option and can be performed safely and effectively in this complex patient population. 
27487644	LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME: PERIOPERATIVE ANESTHESIA CONSIDERATIONS. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease related to genetic mutations in receptors for the cytokine transforming growth factor-receptor type 1 (TGFB-R1) or 2 gene (TGFB-R2) on the cell surface. LDS results in abnormal protein synthesis and dysfunctional connective tissue, which can result in unique cardiovascular anesthesia challenges related to perioperative management. Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist. We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report. Recognition of LDS and intra-operative management of the cardiovascular manifestations of this disease is paramount in ensuring successful surgical outcome and to limit morbidity and mortality.
24431245	Cerebral arterial angioplasty in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome.

32164578	Safety and outcome of gastrostomy tube placement in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a systemic connective tissue disease (CTD) associated with a predisposition for intestinal inflammation, food allergy, and failure to thrive, often necessitating nutritional supplementation via gastrostomy tube. Poor wound healing has also been observed in in some patients with CTD, potentially increasing the risk of surgical interventions. We undertook to determine the safety and efficacy of gastrostomy tube placement in this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 LDS patients who had a total of 12 gastrostomy tubes placed. RESULTS: No procedural complications occurred, although one patient developed buried bumper syndrome in the near post-procedural time period and one patient had a small abscess at a surgical stitch. Most patients exhibited improvements in growth, with a median immediate improvement in BMI Z-score of 0.2 per month following the institution of gastrostomy tube feedings. Those with uncontrolled inflammation due to inflammatory bowel disease or eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease showed the least benefit and in some cases failed to demonstrate significant weight gain despite nutritional supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrostomy tube placement (surgical or endoscopic) is a generally safe and a reasonable therapeutic option for patients with LDS despite their underlying CTD.
30513314	Successful Heart Transplantation in a Patient With Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. Our patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vertebral artery dissection, stroke, prior atrial septal defect repair, and spontaneous left main coronary artery dissection that was revascularized with coronary artery bypass grafting who progressed to end-stage heart failure. She was listed for cardiac transplantation, and a suitable organ became available. She underwent heart transplantation more than 1 year ago successfully. This is the first reported case of a successful heart transplantation in an individual with Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
35095068	Proposed Management Policy for Pregnant Women with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome Following Prophylactic Aortic Root Replacement Based on Experience from a Tertiary Care Center. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a connective tissue disorder with a high incidence of aortic dissection (AD). After treating two previously reported cases of postpartum AD in women with LDS following prophylactic aortic root replacement (ARR), we succeeded in managing a 30-year-old primigravida with no AD during her peripartum period. On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy immediately after delivery. On the basis of our assessment of three cases, including this case, and a literature review, we propose a peripartum management strategy for patients with LDS following prophylactic ARR.
27780078	Loeys-Dietz syndrome and pregnancy: The first ten years. The physiological and haemodynamic changes that occur in pregnancy and the postpartum period increase the risk of aortic dissection. Loeys-Dietz syndrome results from mutations in the genes encoding components of the TGF-beta signalling pathway; aortic pathology is of particular concern in this condition but other vascular abnormalities can also be present. Significant maternal morbidity and mortality has been described in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, but successful and uncomplicated pregnancies are still possible. Nevertheless, all patients with this condition should, at present, be treated as very high risk in pregnancy and the postpartum period, until reliable risk prediction tools become available. This review summarises the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition, and the management strategies currently advocated.
28304197	Endovascular treatment of a dural arteriovenous fistula in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: A case report. Background Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. The manifestations of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.
24239520	First implantation of Gore Hybrid Vascular Graft in the right vertebral artery for cerebral debranching in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. A 53-year-old woman with Loeys-Dietz syndrome developed progressive subclavian artery aneurysm and common carotid artery dissection. She was treated successfully by plugging and coiling of the subclavian aneurysm and its side branches after combined cervical debranching using standard carotid-axillary bypass and Gore Hybrid Vascular Graft for vertebral revascularization. Follow-up control (4 weeks) documented patent debranching, and only minimal residual flow in the subclavian aneurysm. The described off-label use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging patients. Further studies are necessary to evaluate side effects and durability.
21756462	Cochlear implantation in Donnai-Barrow syndrome. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Several ocular abnormalities have also been described in this syndrome, including hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, myopia and retinal detachment. The condition is also associated with diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, absent corpus callosum and developmental delay. We describe the first recorded case of cochlear implantation in this rare disorder. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This case of Donnai-Barrow syndrome was identified from our paediatric cochlear implant database. A case-note review was performed identifying patient demographics, operative findings and surgical outcome. In addition, pre- and post-operative auditory and communication performance was analysed. INTERVENTION: The child initially received a right cochlear implant at 39 months of age, but unfortunately the device failed 4 years post-operatively. Subsequently, bilateral simultaneous cochlear implantation was performed. BKB scores were 98% for bilateral implant use when tested 2 years post-operatively. Individual testing revealed a score of 94% for the right ear alone, and 80% for the left. The child achieved a 100% score on sound localisation testing using 3 speakers. CONCLUSIONS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare cause of SNHL compounded by the potential for visual impairment. To our knowledge this is the first report of cochlear implantation to rehabilitate hearing loss in this condition.
32657950	A Case Report of Donnai-Barrow Syndrome. BACKGROUND: A genetic disorder should be considered when an infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies. Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated. OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.
23729546	A family with Camurati-Engelman disease. The role of the missense p.R218C mutation in TGFB1 in bones and endocrine glands. OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such patients.
10685567	Cochlear implantation for auditory rehabilitation in Camurati-Engelmann disease. Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive hereditary diaphyseal dysplasia) is a rare sclerotic bone disease involving the diaphyses of the long bones, skull base, and clavicles. Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances, and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease. The otologic manifestations of Camurati-Engelmann disease are reviewed, and issues related to cochlear implantation in this rare disease are discussed.
19943817	Unusual association between enchondroma and Camurati-Engelmann disease: a case report. This case report describes an enchondroma of the distal phalanx of the right little finger in a 37-year-old woman with Camurati-Engelmann disease. Curettage of the tumor and artificial bone grafting were performed in May 2004. Surgical treatment resulted in a good clinical outcome with no evidence of recurrence at 5-year follow-up. The genetic relationships between Camurati-Engelmann disease and benign chondroid tumors are discussed.
28137547	Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.
11452173	Scintigraphic evaluation of pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy in a patient with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease). A 27-year-old woman with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) received pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy for bone pain. During therapy, disease activity was assessed serially using bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m HMDP. With pamidronate administration, the bone pain became worse and diaphyseal uptake of Tc-99m HMDP increased, whereas corticosteroid administration improved the bone pain and reduced the diaphyseal uptake. In this case, pamidronate and corticosteroid produced different effects. Bone scintigraphy allowed an objective assessment of the response to these treatments, accurately reflecting clinical symptoms.
15660289	Camurati-Engelmann disease: failure of response to bisphosphonates: report of two cases. Camurati-Engelmann disease is a rare bone disorder characterized by cortical thickening of the diaphysis of tubular bones, with sparing of the epiphysis. It has variable degrees of penetrance and expression, but may be very disabling for the affected individuals who manifest the painful symptoms. The authors report on two women with typical presentation of severe Camurati-Engelmann disease whose treatment with bisphosphonates failed to add any improvement beyond that elicited by corticosteroids alone.

28257476	Cardiac iron overload in chronically transfused patients with thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. The risk and clinical significance of cardiac iron overload due to chronic transfusion varies with the underlying disease. Cardiac iron overload shortens the life expectancy of patients with thalassemia, whereas its effect is unclear in those with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), iron does not seem to deposit quickly in the heart. Our primary objective was to assess through a multicentric study the prevalence of cardiac iron overload, defined as a cardiovascular magnetic resonance T2*<20 ms, in patients with thalassemia, SCA, or MDS. Patient inclusion criteria were an accurate record of erythrocyte concentrates (ECs) received, a transfusion history >8 ECs in the past year, and age older than 6 years. We included from 9 centers 20 patients with thalassemia, 41 with SCA, and 25 with MDS in 2012-2014. Erythrocytapharesis did not consistently prevent iron overload in patients with SCA. Cardiac iron overload was found in 3 (15%) patients with thalassemia, none with SCA, and 4 (16%) with MDS. The liver iron content (LIC) ranged from 10.4 to 15.2 mg/g dry weight, with no significant differences across groups (P = 0.29). Abnormal T2* was not significantly associated with any of the measures of transfusion or chelation. Ferritin levels showed a strong association with LIC. Non-transferrin-bound iron was high in the thalassemia and MDS groups but low in the SCA group (P<0.001). Hepcidin was low in thalassemia, normal in SCA, and markedly elevated in MDS (P<0.001). Two mechanisms may explain that iron deposition largely spares the heart in SCA: the high level of erythropoiesis recycles the iron and the chronic inflammation retains iron within the macrophages. Thalassemia, in contrast, is characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis, unable to handle free iron. Iron accumulation varies widely in MDS syndromes due to the competing influences of abnormal erythropoiesis, excess iron supply, and inflammation.

33836889	A Qualitative Analysis of State Medicaid Coverage Benefits for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT) for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobin disorder, affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), also known as bone marrow transplant (BMT), is currently the only established curative option for SCD. However, alloHCT is an optional benefit under Medicaid. This study of alloHCT coverage for patients with SCD aims to understand the scope of state Medicaid coverage benefits and BMT financial coordinators' experience working with their state Medicaid programs. States estimated to have more than 50 newborns diagnosed with SCD in 2016 and at least one active BMT Clinical Trials Network (1503 [STRIDE 2], NCT02766465) transplant center (TC) were eligible to participate in this study. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews 30 to 60 minutes in length were conducted with BMT financial coordinators via telephone between May and October 2019. A total of 10 BMT financial coordinators from 10 TCs representing eight states (Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia) participated in the semi-structured interviews. Coordinators in all of the included states reported that alloHCT in children with SCD with a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor was covered by their state Medicaid programs. However, only two states (Florida and Texas) had legislative policies mandating coverage of routine medical costs for patients in clinical trials. TCs in two states (Illinois and Pennsylvania) reported accepting out-of-state Medicaid insurance, but only one state (Michigan) covered both travel and lodging for the patient and one caregiver. Four themes emerged when coordinators were asked about their perspectives and experiences working with their corresponding state Medicaid programs: (1) state Medicaid eligibility criteria based on disability were perceived as being restrictive, and Medicaid reimbursement rates were reported to be low; (2) Medicaid fee-for-service plans were perceived as being more comprehensive and easier to navigate compared to comprehensive managed care (CMC) plans; (3) there is a need to address caregiver and financial assistance beyond the health care costs; and (4) completing the insurance authorization process leading up to alloHCT is critical, including peer-to-peer reviews. There is limited legislative policy to help ensure access to clinical trials and provide out-of-state benefits and travel and lodging for Medicaid enrollees with SCD. These data provide insight into potential areas that could influence changes in policy to enhance access to curative therapy for SCD.
28870775	Ethical Challenges in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using an HLA-identical sibling donor offers a very high likelihood of cure with good outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), and alternative donor HCT for SCD is an area of active clinical research. Thus, HCT is a potential option for a growing number of patients with SCD. This expanded use of HCT has raised several ethical questions. Who is eligible for HCT, in terms of both disease severity and psychosocial factors? Should affected children with matched sibling donors undergo HCT only when they have declared themselves as having significant symptomatology? Regarding donors, special ethical challenges include the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to conceive an HLA-identical sibling. In this review, we critically analyze various ethical challenges related to HCT for SCD, and offer recommendations to guide clinical care.
29668544	Splenectomy to Optimize Hemoglobin S Control in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia on Chronic Transfusion Therapy for Stroke Prevention. Chronic transfusion therapy with the goal of maintaining a hemoglobin (Hb) S <30% is the primary recommended treatment for children with sickle cell anemia and a history of overt stroke or abnormal transcranial Doppler examination. We report chronic hypersplenism as a cause of poor HbS% control in 3 children on chronic transfusion therapy for stroke prevention. Splenectomy resulted in a 39.77% (95% confidence interval, 34.3-45.3, P<0.0001) mean reduction in HbS% with no perioperative or infectious complications suggesting the need for additional research into splenectomy as a therapeutic option for select high-risk children to optimize transfusion therapy for stroke prevention.
37184905	Developing an Implementation Blueprint for the NIH HEAL Initiative GRACE Trial: Perspectives on Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation for Chronic Sickle Cell Disease Pain. Objective: This study aimed to explore perspectives of people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) and SCD clinic providers and staff about the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for treating chronic SCD pain. Data obtained were to inform an implementation blueprint for an effectiveness implementation clinical trial (GRACE Trial) testing whether acupuncture or guided relaxation reduces chronic pain when compared with usual care. Design: Qualitative research design. Methods: We conducted 33 semistructured interviews with people with SCD and SCD clinic providers and staff. Interviews were transcribed and coded. A deductive content analysis process was used to identify themes. Results: Four themes were identified: Receptivity to Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation, Limited Awareness, Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) Therapy Preference, and Access Barriers. Both patients and clinic providers and staff were open to the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic pain treatment. After learning about these CIH therapies, some patients expressed a preference for one therapy over the other. They also discussed their ability to successfully engage with each therapy. There is a need to dispel misconceptions about the therapies by increasing understanding of how each therapy is implemented and functions to reduce pain. We identified several potential barriers that might affect the success of the trial and future health system integration, including time, transportation, and technology. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to present perspectives of both patients with SCD and clinic providers and staff on the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic SCD pain. Stakeholders' early input and perspectives highlighted that they welcome nonpharmacological CIH therapies. Implementation of a clinical trial and future health system integration will require the addressing misinformation and identifying strategies to overcome access barriers.

35260809	A population-based analysis of predictors of penile surgical intervention among inpatients with acute priapism. While consensus exists regarding risk factors for priapism, predictors of operative intervention are less well established. We assessed patient and hospital-level predictors associated with penile surgical intervention (PSI) for patients admitted with acute priapism, as well as length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charges using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015). Inpatients with acute priapism were stratified by PSI, defined as penile shunts, incisions, and placement of penile prostheses, exclusive of irrigation procedures. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were utilized to assess predictors of PSI. Negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare PSI to LOS and total hospital charges, respectively. Among 14,529 weighted hospitalizations, 4,953 underwent PSI. Non-Medicare insurances, substance abuse, and >=3 Elixhauser comorbidities had increased odds of PSI. Conversely, Black patients, sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, neurologic diseases, malignancies, and teaching hospitals had lower odds. PSI coincided with shorter median LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.62; p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the mean hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Additional subgroup analysis revealed penile incisions and shunts primarily associated with reduced LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.66; p < 0.001) and total hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Further work is required to understand predictors of poor outcomes in these populations.

32039737	Impact of a paediatric-adult care transition programme on the health status of patients with sickle cell disease: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (the DREPADO trial). BACKGROUND: Thanks to advancements in medical care, a majority of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) worldwide live beyond 18 years of age, and therefore, patients initially followed in paediatric departments are then transferred to adult departments. This paediatric-adult care transition is a period with an increased risk of discontinuity of care and subsequent morbidity and mortality. During this period, the patient will have to manage new interlocutors and places of care, and personal issues related to the period of adolescence. To take into consideration all these aspects, an interesting approach is to use the whole system approach to the patient, as presented in the biopsychosocial approach. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the impact of the proposed biopsychosocial paediatric-adult transition programme. METHODS: The DREPADO study is a multicentre randomised control trial comparing a control group (Arm A) to an interventional group with a paediatric-adult transition programme based on a biopsychosocial approach (Arm B). To be included, patients should have the SS, SC, or Sbeta form of sickle cell disease and be aged between 16 and 17 years. The randomisation in a 1:1 ratio assigns to Arm A or B. The primary outcome is the number of hospital admissions and emergencies for complications in the index hospital, in the 2 years after the first consultation in the adult department of care. Secondary outcomes consider the quality of life, but also include coping skills such as sense of self-efficacy and disease knowledge. To provide patient and parent knowledge and coping skills, the transition programme is composed of three axes: educational, psychological, and social, conducted individually and in groups. DISCUSSION: By providing self-care knowledge and coping skills related to SCD and therapeutics, helping empower patientsin relation to pain management and emotions, and facilitating the relationship to oneself, others, and care in Arm B of the DREPADO study, we believe that the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD may be reduced after the proposed paediatric-adult transition programme.

32202252	Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.
31942751	Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted. MAIN RESULTS: One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sbeta0-thalassaemia, 11Sbeta+-thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.
28500860	Interventions for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD. Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits and may lower intelligence quotient. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 19 September 2016. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 06 October 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention.Three trials compared the use of regular long-term red blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children with no previous long-term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents).The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long-term red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarcts) Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124 participants, low-quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low-quality evidence).No deaths were reported in either trial.Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of: acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate-quality evidence).Long-term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate -0.54; 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants; one trial)Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low-quality evidence).We are very uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low-quality evidence).The trial did not report: comparative numbers for SCD-related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention, children (121 participants; one trial)We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts); all-cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD-related complications, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low-quality evidence). Secondary prevention, children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial)We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all-cause mortality, Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to 253.66) (very low-quality evidence).Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD-related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low-quality evidence).Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD.Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, long-term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke, and other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises).In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts. No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions.Switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts and SCD-related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention.All other evidence in this review is of very low-quality.
33541761	Parameters affecting successful stem cell collections for genetic therapies in sickle cell disease. Emerging cellular therapies require the collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by apheresis for in vitro manipulation to accomplish gene addition or gene editing. These therapies require relatively large numbers of HSCs within a short time frame to generate an efficacious therapeutic product. This review focuses on the principal factors that affect collection outcomes, especially relevant to gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
36866433	Case report: Successful treatment with plasma exchange in life-threatening hyperhemolytic syndrome unrelated to sickle cell disease. INTRODUCTION: Hyperhemolytic syndrome (HHS) is a severe form of delayed transfusion reaction primarily described in sickle cell anemia patients which is characterized by a hemoglobin decrease to pre-transfusion levels or lower, often with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of auto- or allo-antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of severe HHS in patients without sickle cell anemia refractory to treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins, and rituximab. In one case, temporary relief was achieved with eculizumab. In both cases, plasma exchange resulted in a profound and immediate response allowing for splenectomy and resolution of hemolysis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We discuss the pathophysiology of HHS, its presentation and treatment and expand on the possible role of plasma exchange in this setting.

33176303	"Hyperhaemolytic Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease: Clearing the Cobwebs. Sickle cell disease (SCD) presents with a dynamic background of haemolysis and deepening anaemia. This increases the demand for transfusion if any additional strain on haemopoiesis is encountered due to any other physiological or pathological causes. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents are placed on chronic blood transfusion; those with acute sequestration and acute chest syndrome are likewise managed with blood transfusion. These patients are prone to develop complications of blood transfusion including alloimmunization and hyperhaemolytic syndrome (HHS). This term is used to describe haemolysis of both transfused and ""own"" red cells occurring during or post-transfusion in sickle cell patients. Hyperhaemolysis results in worsening post-transfusion haemoglobin due attendant haemolysis of both transfused and autologous red cells. The mechanism underlying this rare and usually fatal complication of SCD has been thought to be secondary to changes in the red cell membrane with associated immunological reactions against exposed cell membrane phospholipids. The predisposition to HHS in sickle cell is also varied and the search for a prediction pattern or value has been evasive. This review discusses the pathogenesis, risk factors and treatment of HHS, elaborating on what is known of this rare condition."
32469414	Assessment of Patient and Caregiver Attitudes and Approaches to Decision-Making Regarding Bone Marrow Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: A Qualitative Study. Importance: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is a potentially curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patient and caregiver attitudes toward BMT for SCD and the willingness to accept risks of BMT vary, but these attitudes are not well understood. Objective: To understand patient and caregiver perceptions of and attitudes toward BMT for SCD and decision-making about BMT. Design, Setting, and Participants: Qualitative study of interview transcripts from a convenience sample. Transcripts were from adults with SCD and caregivers of patients with SCD recruited from national and regional SCD conferences, symposia, and sickle cell clinics in 2 cities. Interview transcripts were used from the needs assessment phase to develop a patient-decision aid in 2013 to 2014 (group 1) and from the baseline point in 2015 to 2016 (group 2) of the parent trial, a randomized clinical trial of adults and caregivers of patients with SCD to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient decision aid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant perspectives on decision-making regarding BMT for SCD. Results: Fifty-seven transcripts from adults with SCD and 50 transcripts from caregivers of patients with SCD were included. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of adults with SCD was 34 (21-50) years in group 1 and 30 (23-38) years in group 2. The median (IQR) age of caregivers was 42.5 (31-52) years in group 1 and 41 (35-46.5) years in group 2. Most transcripts from adults with SCD (75.0% in group 1 and 72.4% in group 2) and caregivers of patients with SCD (76.7% in group 1 and 85.0% in group 2) were from female participants. Bone marrow transplant was perceived as a treatment option associated with serious risks. Reported attitudes toward BMT occurred on a continuum ranging from unfavorable to favorable. Participants reported serious decisional dilemma regarding BMT for SCD. Most participants expressed interest in learning about BMT or curative treatments. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study found a continuum in attitudes toward BMT for SCD and highlights the complexity of decision-making in BMT for SCD. Patients and families with SCD expressed an interest in learning about BMT. Future prospective studies of patient decision-making regarding BMT, especially in the context of emerging curative and novel disease-modifying therapies for SCD, are warranted.
34101983	SNAP: Supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention in children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES: To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients <=22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.
37939876	Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know. Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.
30667500	Association of Matched Sibling Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation With Transcranial Doppler Velocities in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia. Importance: In children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), high transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities are associated with stroke risk, which is reduced by chronic transfusion. Whether matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (MSD-HSCT) can reduce velocities in patients with SCA is unknown. Objective: To determine the association of MSD-HSCT with TCD velocities as a surrogate for the occurrence of ischemic stroke in children with SCA. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nonrandomized controlled intervention study conducted at 9 French centers. Patients with SCA were enrolled between December 2010 and June 2013, with 3-year follow-up ending in January 2017. Children with SCA were eligible if younger than 15 years, required chronic transfusions for persistently elevated TCD velocities, and had at least 1 sibling without SCA from the same 2 parents. Families agreed to HLA antigen typing and transplantation if a matched sibling donor was identified or to standard care in the absence of a matched sibling donor. Exposures: MSD-HSCT (n = 32), compared with standard care (n = 35) (transfusions for >=1 year with potential switch to hydroxyurea thereafter), using propensity score matching. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the highest time-averaged mean of maximum velocities in 8 cerebral arteries, measured by TCD (TCD velocity) at 1 year. Twenty-five of 29 secondary outcomes were analyzed, including the highest TCD velocity at 3 years and normalization of velocities (<170 cm/s) and ferritin levels at 1 and 3 years. Results: Sixty-seven children with SCA (median age, 7.6 years; 35 girls [52%]) were enrolled (7 with stroke history). In the matched sample, highest TCD velocities at 1 year were significantly lower on average in the transplantation group (129.6 cm/s) vs the standard care group (170.4 cm/s; difference, -40.8 cm/s [95% CI, -62.9 to -18.6]; P < .001). Of the 25 analyzed secondary end points, 4 showed significant differences, including the highest TCD velocity at 3 years (112.4 cm/s in the transplantation group vs 156.7 cm/s in the standard care group; difference, -44.3 [95% CI, -71.9 to -21.1]; P = .001); normalization rate at 1 year (80.0% in the transplantation group vs 48.0% in the standard care group; difference, 32.0% [95% CI, 0.2% to 58.6%]; P = .045); and ferritin levels at 1 year (905 ng/mL in the transplantation group vs 2529 ng/mL in the standard care group; difference, -1624 [95% CI, -2370 to -879]; P < .001) and 3 years (382 ng/mL in the transplantation group vs 2170 ng/mL in the standard care group; difference, -1788 [95% CI, -2570 to -1006]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with SCA requiring chronic transfusion because of persistently elevated TCD velocities, MSD-HSCT was significantly associated with lower TCD velocities at 1 year compared with standard care. Further research is warranted to assess the effects of MSD-HSCT on clinical outcomes and over longer follow-up. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01340404.
31742587	Beneficial effects of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle microvasculature in sickle cell disease patients. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy leading to 2 major clinical manifestations: severe chronic hemolytic anemia and iterative vaso-occlusive crises. SCD is also accompanied by profound muscle microvascular remodeling. The beneficial effects of endurance training on microvasculature are widely known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an endurance training program on microvasculature of skeletal muscle in SCD patients. A biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental exercise was performed before and after the training period. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets from 32 patients were obtained. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the nontraining (n = 17) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Training consisted of three 40-minute cycle ergometer exercise sessions per week for 8 weeks. Histological analysis highlighted microvascular benefits in the training SCD patients compared with nontraining patients, including increases in capillary density (P = .003), number of capillaries around a fiber (P = .015), and functional exchange surface (P < .0001). Conversely, no significant between-group difference was found in the morphology of capillaries. Indexes of physical ability also improved in the training patients. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise training program improved the muscle capillary network and partly reversed the microvascular defects commonly observed in skeletal muscle of SCD patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.

BACKGROUND: Post-transfusion survival of donor red blood cells (RBCs) is important for effective chronic transfusion therapy in conditions including sickle cell disease (SCD). Biotin labeling RBCs allows direct in vivo measurement of multiple donor RBC units simultaneously post-transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In an observational trial of patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusion therapy, aliquots of RBCs from one transfusion episode were biotin-labeled and infused along with the unlabeled RBC units. Serial blood samples were obtained to measure RBC survival. Donor units were tested for RBC indices, hemoglobin fractionation, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. For microcytic donor RBCs (MCV < 70 fL), HBA1 and HBA2 genetic testing was performed on whole blood. RESULTS: We present one recipient, a pediatric patient with SCD and splenectomy who received two RBC units with aliquots from each unit labeled at distinct biotin densities (2 and 18 mug/mL biotin). One donor unit was identified to have microcytosis (MCV 68.5 fL after biotinylation); whole blood sample obtained at a subsequent donation showed 2-gene deletion alpha-thalassemia trait (alpha-3.7kb/alpha-3.7kb) and normal serum ferritin. G6PD activity was >60% of normal mean for both. The RBCs with alpha-thalassemia RBC had accelerated clearance and increased surface phosphatidylserine post-transfusion, as compared with the normocytic RBC (half life 65 vs. 86 days, respectively). DISCUSSION: Post-transfusion RBC survival may be lower for units from donors with alpha-thalassemia trait, although the impact of thalassemia trait donors on transfusion efficacy requires further study.

31413089	Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide and approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways 'downstream' to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. To date, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition of intracellular HbS polymerization, inhibition of oxidant stress and inflammation, and perturbation of the activation of the endothelium and other blood components (e.g. platelets, white blood cells, coagulation proteins) involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. In this article, we present a crash-course review of disease-modifying approaches (minus hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) for patients with sickle cell disease currently, or recently, tested in clinical trials in the era following approval of hydroxyurea.
28159390	Sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a common and life-threatening haematological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Abnormal sickle-shaped erythrocytes disrupt blood flow in small vessels, and this vaso-occlusion leads to distal tissue ischaemia and inflammation, with symptoms defining the acute painful sickle-cell crisis. Repeated sickling and ongoing haemolytic anaemia, even when subclinical, lead to parenchymal injury and chronic organ damage, causing substantial morbidity and early mortality. Currently available treatments are limited to transfusions and hydroxycarbamide, although stem cell transplantation might be a potentially curative therapy. Several new therapeutic options are in development, including gene therapy and gene editing. Recent advances include systematic universal screening for stroke risk, improved management of iron overload using oral chelators and non-invasive MRI measurements, and point-of-care diagnostic devices. Controversies include the role of haemolysis in sickle cell disease pathophysiology, optimal management of pregnancy, and strategies to prevent cerebrovascular disease.
36400544	The Evolving Landscape of Drug Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease. Although sickle cell disease can be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy and gene editing, these treatments remain unavailable to most patients. As understanding of the disease pathophysiology increases, progress is being made in developing drug therapies. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes. Clinical and surrogate endpoints, other than vaso-occlusive crisis, are increasingly being considered in the evaluation of novel drugs.
30300449	Deferasirox in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia or sickle cell anemia: A large cohort real-life experience from Turkey (REACH-THEM). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox therapy in a large observational cohort of children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell anemia (SCA) in Turkey. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study including TDT and SCA patients aged 2-18 years with iron overload (>=100 mL/kg of pRBC or a serum ferritin [SF] level >1000 mug/L) receiving deferasirox. Patients were followed for up to 3 years according to standard practice. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were evaluated (415 [94.5%] TDT, 143 [32.6%] between 2 and 6 years). Serum ferritin levels consistently and significantly decreased across 3 years of deferasirox therapy from a median of 1775.5 to 1250.5 mug/L (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin decreases were noted in TDT (1804.9 to 1241 mug/L), SCA (1655.5 to 1260 mug/L), and across age groups of 2-6 years (1971.5 to 1499 mug/L), 7-12 years (1688.5 to 1159.8 mug/L), and 13-18 years (1496.5 to 1107 mug/L). Serum ferritin decreases were also noted for all deferasirox dose groups but only significant in patients with doses >=30 mg/kg/d (n = 120, -579.6 median reduction, P < 0.001). Only 9 (2%) patients had adverse events suspected to be related to deferasirox. Serum creatinine slightly increased but remained within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Deferasirox has long-term efficacy and safety in children with TDT and SCA, although higher doses (>=30 mg/kg/d) may be required to achieve iron balance.
35302009	Long-term Survival after Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease Compared to the United States Population. Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life threatening complications most of which occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In the current era with interest in gene therapy and gene editing we felt it timely to report on sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least 2-year after transplantation, not previously reported. Our objectives were to (1) report the conditional survival rates of patients who were alive for 2 or more years after transplantation (2) identify risk factors for death beyond 2 years after transplantation and (3) compare all-cause mortality risks to those of an age-, sex- and race-matched general population in the United States. By limiting to 2-year survivors, we exclude deaths that occur as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified records of 1149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source and 950 patients were eligible (https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). All analyses were performed in this secure cloud environment using the available statistical software package(s). The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing results from an earlier publication. Conditional survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that had survived a given length (x) of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with mortality beyond 2 years after transplantation. The standardized relative mortality risk (SMR) or the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths, was used to quantify all-cause mortality risk after transplantation and compared to age, race and sex-matched general population. Person-years at risk were calculated from an anchor date (i.e., 2-, 5- and 7-years) after transplantation until date of death or last date known alive. The expected number of deaths was calculated using age, race and sex-specific US mortality rates. The median follow up was 5 years (range 2-20) and 300 (32%) patients were observed for more than 7 years. Among those who lived for at least 7 years after transplantation the 12-year probability of survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%). Compared to an age-, race- and sex-matched US population, the risk for late death after transplantation was higher as late as 7 years after transplantation (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2; P= .020) but the risk receded over time. Risk factors for late death included age at transplant and donor type. For every 10-year increment in patient age, an older patient was 1.75 times more likely to die than a younger patient (P= .0004). Compared to HLA-matched siblings the use of other donors was associated with higher risk for late death (HR 3.49; P= .003). Graft failure (beyond 2-years after transplantation) was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) and graft failure was higher after transplantation of grafts from donors who were not HLA-matched siblings (HR 2.59, P< .0001). Long-term survival after transplantation is excellent and support this treatment as a cure for sickle cell disease. The expected risk for death recedes over time but the risk for late death is not negligible.
34607344	Economic evaluation of regular transfusions for cerebral infarct recurrence in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Trial. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published evidence-based guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Although the guidelines were based on National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trials, no cost-effectiveness analysis was completed for children with SCA and silent cerebral infarcts. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing regular blood transfusion vs standard care using SIT (Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion) Trial participants. This analysis included a modified societal perspective with direct costs (hospitalization, emergency department visit, transfusion, outpatient care, and iron chelation) and indirect costs (special education). Direct medical costs were estimated from hospitalizations from SIT hospitals and unlinked aggregated hospital and outpatient costs from SIT sites by using the Pediatric Health Information System. Indirect costs were estimated from published literature. Effectiveness was prevention of infarct recurrence. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using a 3-year time horizon (mean SIT Trial participant follow-up) compared transfusion vs standard care. A total of 196 participants received transfusions (n = 90) or standard care (n = 106), with a mean age of 10.0 years. Annual hospitalization costs were reduced by 54% for transfusions vs standard care ($4929 vs $10 802), but transfusion group outpatient costs added $22 454 to $137 022 per year. Special education cost savings were $2634 over 3 years for every infarct prevented. Transfusion therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $22 025 per infarct prevented. Children with preexisting silent cerebral infarcts receiving blood transfusions had lower hospitalization costs but higher outpatient costs, primarily associated with the oral iron chelator deferasirox. Regular blood transfusion therapy is cost-effective for infarct recurrence in children with SCA. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00072761.
31860969	The role of hydroxyurea to prevent silent stroke in sickle cell disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Chronic blood transfusions are standard of care for stroke prevention in sickle cell disease but is not cost effective and not without risks. Hydroxyurea has emerged as an option in the prevention of silent stroke in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing silent strokes in a systematic review by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the related articles. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of hydroxyurea vs blood transfusions and observational studies evaluating the role of hydroxyurea to prevent stroke and silent stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell beta thalassemia. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software version 13. RESULTS: We included 10 single arm observational studies with 361 participants, and one RCT study with 60 participants receiving hydroxyurea, respectively. There were no deaths attributed to hydroxyurea. The results revealed that 1% (95% CIs 0.0 to 0.05) of patients receiving hydroxyurea had stroke. 18% (95% CIs 0.03 to 0.4) of the hydroxyurea patients had silent stroke. 24% (95% CIs 0.02 to 0.57) of the hydroxyurea patients had adverse events attributed to hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that hydroxyurea is safe and may prevent silent stroke and stroke in sickle cell disease. More high-quality studies including RCTs are needed.
31014083	Antibiotic Use and Respiratory Pathogens in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome. Background: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Historically, the most common pathogens were Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus. Pediatric patients receiving guideline-adherent therapy experienced fewer ACS-related and all-cause 30-day readmissions compared with those receiving nonadherent therapy. This has not been evaluated in adults. Objectives: The primary objectives were to characterize antibiotic use and pathogens. The secondary objective was to assess the occurrence of readmissions associated with guideline-adherent and clinically appropriate treatment compared with regimens that did not meet those criteria. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for adults with SCD hospitalized between August 1, 2014, and July 31, 2017, with pneumonia (PNA) or ACS. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: A total of 139 patients with 255 hospitalizations were reviewed. Among 41 respiratory cultures, 3 organisms were isolated: Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and budding yeast. Respiratory panels were collected on 121 admissions, with 17 positive for 1 virus; all were negative for Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. There were significantly more ACS-/PNA-related 7-day readmissions from patients on guideline-adherent regimens compared with nonadherent regimens (3.7% vs 0%; P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: These findings challenge existing knowledge regarding the most common pathogens in adults with SCD with ACS or PNA. Routine inclusion of a macrolide may not be necessary. Future studies focused on pathogen characterization with standardized assessment are necessary to determine appropriate empirical therapy in this population.
32305060	Patient and family experience with chronic transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: A qualitative study. BACKGROUND: There is a limited understanding of the patient and family experience of Chronic Transfusion Therapy (CTT) for prevention of complications of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We sought to understand patient and family experience with CTT using qualitative methods. METHODS: Fifteen parents of children < 18 years old and nine children 12-18 years old with SCD who were receiving CTT for > 1 year were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format, and interviews were analyzed using open coding methods. RESULTS: Four themes created a narrative of the patient and family experience of CTT: 1) Burden of CTT, 2) Coping with CTT, 3) Perceived benefits and risks of CTT, and 4) Decision making regarding CTT. Participants reported substantial burden of CTT, including the impact of CTT on daily life and family, distress about venous access, burden of chelation therapy, and anxiety about CTT complications. Participants described how they coped with CTT. Participants reported increased energy, decreased pain, fewer hospitalizations, and stroke prevention with CTT, but also recognized complications of CTT, though awareness was limited in adolescents. Parents described sharing in the informed decision-making process with their healthcare provider about CTT, but adolescent patient participants reported that they were not involved in this process. CONCLUSIONS: CTT is associated with significant patient and family burden. Support from family, healthcare providers and school may help individuals cope with some of this burden. These findings provide the basis for future studies to identify strategies to mitigate the burden of CTT and improve the patient experience with this therapy. Future studies should also systematically assess patient knowledge about the key components of CTT and chelation using quantitative assessments.
34080441	Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods pilot study. OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported >= 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
32885834	"Adjuvant interventions with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: A mixed treatment network meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive crisis is the most common clinical feature requiring opioid analgesics in patients with sickle cell disease. We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the drugs that can be used as add-on with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS: Sickle cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crisis receiving adjuvants to opioids for pain management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A number of patients with complete pain relief and pain scores assessed either by visual ana-log or by a numerical rating scale were the primary outcomes. Adverse events and dose of opioids (in morphine equiva-lents) for pain alleviation between the treatment arms were the secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Eleven studies evaluating the addition of ketorolac, magnesium sulfate, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, methadone, inhalational nitric oxide, methylprednisolone, and arginine with morphine were obtained. The pooled analysis showed a favorable effect in the pain reduction for the additions of arginine {-2 [-3.39, -0.61]} and ibuprofen {-1.7 [-3.26, -0.14]} with morphine. Arginine has high probability of being the ""best"" in the pool followed by ibuprofen. No significant differ-ences were observed in the risk of adverse events {ketoprofen-0.84 [0.42, 1.65]; magnesium sulfate-1.81 [0.64, 5.81]; and arginine-2.08 [0.18, 24.31]}. A significant lower dose of opioid was required when given adjunctive to argin-ine, inhalational nitric oxide, and methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: We observed that arginine and ibuprofen could produce additional analgesic effects when combined with morphine in vaso-occlusive crisis."
38285418	Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease. This article presents a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes at home.
29377071	How I manage red cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest serious inherited diseases in the world, and red cell transfusion is still one of the few effective treatments for acute and chronic complications. Transfusion corrects anaemia and dilutes out the number of red cells able to cause vaso-occlusion and vascular damage. Urgent red cell transfusions are used to correct acute anaemia, treat acute chest syndrome and patients with acute neurological symptoms. We use elective transfusions preoperatively for moderate risk surgery, and in some pregnant women. There is good evidence for the use of long-term regular transfusions in primary stroke prevention, with the aim of keeping the percentage of sickle haemoglobin below 30%. Long-term transfusions are also used in secondary stroke prevention, and the management of progressive organ damage, including renal impairment and pulmonary hypertension. Blood needs to be matched for ABO, RH and Kell, although alloantibodies may still develop and require more careful, extended cross-matching. Delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions are relatively common, difficult to diagnose and manage, and potentially fatal.
35072359	Successful use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute chest syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease and SARS-CoV-2. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the successful native lung recovery of a child with SCD referred for lung transplant (LTx) evaluation who was on prolonged veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He initially presented with acute chest syndrome complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection that ultimately required dual-lumen, single bicaval VV-ECMO cannulation for respiratory support. Despite the increased risk of hemolysis and thrombosis from SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was successfully supported on VV-ECMO for 71 days without complications leading to native lung recovery with meticulous management of his SCD therapy. This report provides new insight on our approach to VV-ECMO support in a child with SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a successful outcome, the patient has returned home but still on mechanical ventilation with LTx still an option if he is not eventually liberated from invasive respiratory support.
32507420	Integrative approaches to treating pain in sickle cell disease: Pre-clinical and clinical evidence. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by hemolysis, end-organ damage, inflammation, and pain. Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises are a unique feature of SCD. Many patients also develop lifelong chronic pain. Opioids are the primary method of pain treatment in SCD; however, continued use is associated with several adverse effects. Integrative approaches to treating pain in SCD are increasingly being explored to prevent the side effects associated with opioids. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of pain in SCD and describe mechanism-based integrative approaches for treating pain.

28748876	End-stage renal disease in patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell nephropathy is a severe complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that has a wide range of manifestations, from asymptomatic microalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The data on patients with SCD who develop ESRD are scarce. The aim of this study was to explore the course of patients with SCD who developed ESRD and received renal replacement therapy (RRT). The course of patients with SCD who developed ESRD and started dialysis at two centers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia was retrospectively analyzed. Parameters included age at initiation of dialysis, survival until death or kidney transplantation, hospitalization due to pain crisis, disease-related parameters, and requirement for blood transfusion. Sixteen patients with SCD developed ESRD and started RRT with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The mean age at initiation of dialysis was 46.6 years. The majority of patients (10 out of 16) were resistant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and required blood transfusion repeatedly. Pain crises were infrequently encountered. Median survival was 54 months. Four patients received kidney transplantation with good outcome. In conclusion, most patients with SCD who developed ESRD were resistant to ESA and required repeated blood transfusion. The rate of hospitalization due to pain crisis was relatively low. Survival on dialysis was comparable to that of patients with no SCD, and the post-transplant course was relatively benign.

31628051	Improved Titer and Gene Transfer by Lentiviral Vectors Using Novel, Small beta-Globin Locus Control Region Elements. beta-globin lentiviral vectors (beta-LV) have faced challenges in clinical translation for gene therapy of sickle cell disease (SCD) due to low titer and sub-optimal gene transfer to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). To overcome the challenge of preserving efficacious expression while increasing vector performance, we used published genomic and epigenomic data available through ENCODE to redefine enhancer element boundaries of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) to construct novel ENCODE core sequences. These novel LCR elements were used to design a beta-LV of reduced proviral length, termed CoreGA-AS3-FB, produced at higher titers and possessing superior gene transfer to HSPCs when compared to the full-length parental beta-LV at equal MOI. At low vector copy number, vectors containing the ENCODE core sequences were capable of reversing the sickle phenotype in a mouse model of SCD. These studies provide a beta-LV that will be beneficial for gene therapy of SCD by significantly reducing the cost of vector production and extending the vector supply.
34234298	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reverses white matter injury measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in sickle cell disease patients. Brain injury in sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a wide spectrum of neurological damage. Neurocognitive deficits have been described even without established neurological lesions. DTI is a rapid, noninvasive, and non-contrast method that enables detection of normal-appearing white matter lesions not detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to evaluate if stem cell transplantation can revert white matter lesions in patients with SCD. Twenty-eight SCD patients were evaluated with MRI and DTI before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with 26 healthy controls (HC). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity maps, global efficiency, path length, and clustering coefficients. Compared to HC, SCD patients had a lower FA (p = 0.0086) before HSCT. After HSCT, FA increased and was not different from healthy controls (p = 0.1769). Mean MD, RD, and AD decreased after HSCT (p = 0.0049; p = 0.0029; p = 0.0408, respectively). We confirm previous data of white matter lesions in SCD and present evidence that HSCT promotes recovery of brain injury with potential improvement of brain structural connectivity.
32878859	Long-term oxygen therapy in children with sickle cell disease and hypoxaemia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and safety profile of nocturnal long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and chronic hypoxaemia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS, SETTING AND INTERVENTION: Children with SCD who started LTOT from 2014 to early 2019 in two tertiary hospitals in London, UK were retrospectively enrolled. Patients who started disease-modifying therapies <12 months before LTOT or while on LTOT were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minor and major adverse events during LTOT were reported. Laboratory and clinical data, transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans and overnight oximetry studies performed at steady state within 12 months before and after starting LTOT were compared. RESULTS: Nineteen children (10 males; median age 12 years, range 6-15) were included. Nearly half of them (9/19; 47%) were on hydroxyurea at baseline. No child discontinued LTOT because of intolerance or poor adherence. No major adverse events were reported. Laboratory data did not show significant changes in haemoglobin and reticulocyte count after 1 year of follow-up. No statistically significant change in the incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events was noted (median annual rate from 0.5 to 0 episode per patient/year; p=0.062). Overnight oximetry tests performed while on LTOT showed improvements in all oxygen saturation parameters (mean overnight and nadir SpO2, % of time spent with SpO2 <90%) compared with the baseline. CONCLUSION: LTOT is a safe and feasible treatment option for children with SCD and chronic hypoxaemia.
28673501	Management of iron overload in hemoglobinopathies. Hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most frequent monogenic diseases in the world. Transfusion has improved dramatically their prognosis, but provokes iron overload, which induces multiple organ damages. Iron overload is related to accumulation of iron released from hemolysis and transfused red cell, but also, in thalassemic patients, secondary to ineffective erythropoiesis, which increases intestinal iron absorption via decreased hepcidin production. Transfusion-related cardiac iron overload remains a main cause of death in thalassemia in well-resourced countries, and is responsible for severe hepatic damages in sickle cell disease. Regular monitoring by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using myocardial T2* (ms) and Liver Iron Content (LIC) (mg of iron/g dry weight) are now standards of care in chronically transfused patients. Serum ferritin level measurements and record of the total number of transfused erythrocyte concentrates are also helpful tools. Three iron chelators are currently available, deferoxamine, which must be injected subcutaneously or intravenously, and two oral chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox. We will review the main characteristics of these drugs and their indications.
30893088	Pain and sickle cell disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment but remain suboptimal. We discuss mechanism-based treatable targets devoid of opioids to prevent and/or treat SCD pain. RECENT FINDINGS: Understanding the pathogenesis of pain is critical to develop targeted therapies. Nevertheless, acute and chronic pain can have independent and/or overlapping mechanisms. The origin of pain involves neurovascular and neuroimmune interactions from the periphery and/or central nervous system. Immunomodulatory components of acute and/or chronic sickle pain for targeting/preventing pain genesis include mast cell and microglial activation, neurogenic inflammation, and leukocyte-derived elastase. Vascular modulators include hypoxia/reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, hemolysis, and adhesion molecules. However, existent pain requires analgesics devoid of an inadvertent effect on sickle pathobiology. Recent analgesic targets include cannabinoid and nociceptin receptors and serotonergic spinothalamic pathway. Complementary approaches (e.g., acupuncture, hypnosis, perception-based therapies) have shown analgesic potential. Owing to heterogeneity in pain development, it remains challenging to combat SCD pain with any one therapy. SUMMARY: SCD pain involves neuroimmune and neurovascular interactions. Such interactions have pronociceptive impacts and impart therapy resistance. Elucidating molecular and cellular entities affecting neuronal interactions in sickle microenvironment may prevent SCD pain and/or provide improved analgesic approaches.
34889383	Optimizing management of sickle cell disease in patients undergoing surgery. Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are likely to be referred for surgery at some point in their lifetime due to a high incidence of musculoskeletal and intrabdominal complications such as avascular necrosis and gallbladder disease. Preoperative optimization is a multidisciplinary process that involves a hematologist with SCD expertise, an anesthesiologist, and the surgical team. The type and risk classification of the surgery, disease severity, medications, baseline hemoglobin, transfusion history, and history of prior surgical complications are often documented. Clinicians should consider perioperative risk assessment that includes determining the patient's functional status and cardiovascular risk and screening for obstructive sleep apnea. Many patients will require preoperative transfusion to reduce the risk of postoperative complications such as acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive pain crises. The hematologist should consider the patient's preoperative transfusion requirements and ensure that the surgical team has an appropriate plan for postoperative observation and management. This often includes follow-up laboratory studies, a postoperative pain management plan, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The transfusion plan should be patient-specific and take into account the SCD genotype, baseline hemoglobin, disease severity, risk classification of the surgery, and history of prior surgical complications. In the intraoperative and postoperative period, dehydration, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis should be avoided, and incentive spirometry should be utilized to minimize complications such as acute chest syndrome. In this review we discuss preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies to optimize patients with SCD undergoing surgery.
32705357	Neuropathic Pain and Sickle Cell Disease: a Review of Pharmacologic Management. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains among the most common and severe monogenic disorders present in the world today. Although sickle cell pain has been traditionally characterized as nociceptive, a significant portion of sickle cell patients has reported neuropathic pain symptoms. Our review article will discuss clinical aspects of SCD-related neuropathic pain, epidemiology of neuropathic pain among individuals with SCD, pain mechanisms, and current and future potential pharmacological interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Neuropathic pain in SCD is a complicated condition that often has a lifelong and significant negative impact on life; therefore, improved pain management is considered a significant and unmet need. Neuropathic pain mechanisms are heterogeneous, and the difficulty in determining their individual contribution to specific pain types may contribute to poor treatment outcomes in this population. Our review article outlines several pharmacological modalities which may be employed to treat neuropathic pain in SCD patients.
33674866	Pain Experiences of Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Qualitative Study. OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about pain management experiences throughout this process. The objective of this study was to explore patients' experiences with pain and pain management during and after HSCT for SCD. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with 10 patients who underwent HSCT for SCD. We transcribed interviews verbatim and inductively identified codes. We used thematic analysis alongside a constant comparative method to develop and refine a codebook that aided in the identification of themes. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged. (1) The pain trajectory: patients described a fluctuating course of pain during HSCT, which often extended long afterwards and impacted all aspects of life, particularly affected by pre-HSCT experiences; (2) The role of opioids-a double-edged sword: patients described opioids as reducing pain but insufficiently to balance significant adverse effects and burden; (3) Patient-centered decision making in pain management: patients described insufficient agency in decisions about opioid use and weaning; and (4) Consequences of health-related stigma: patients described experiences with stigma, mainly related to opioid use and weaning, as similar to pre-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of patients who have undergone HSCT for SCD, clinicians should use a patient-centered approach, integrating non-opioid approaches into pain management, particularly psychosocial support. As transplant for SCD becomes increasingly available, incorporating patient perspectives may improve health care delivery and overall patient experiences.
32790687	Outcomes following kidney transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: The impact of automated exchange blood transfusion. There are over 12,000 people with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the UK, and 4-12% of patients who develop Sickle Cell Nephropathy (SCN) progress to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Renal transplantation offers the best outcomes for these patients with but their access to transplantation is often limited. Regular automated exchange blood transfusions (EBT) reduce the complications of SCD and may improve outcomes. However, concerns over alloimmunisation limit its widespread implementation. In this retrospective multicenter study, data were collected on 34 SCD patients who received a kidney transplant across 6 London Hospitals between 1997 and 2017. 20/34 patients were on an EBT program, pre or post renal transplantation. Overall patient and graft survival were inferior to contemporaneous UK data in the ESRD population as a whole, a finding which is well-recognised. However, patient survival (CI 95%, p = 0.0032), graft survival and graft function were superior at all time-points in those who received EBT versus those who did not. 4/20 patients (20%) on EBT developed de novo donor specific antibodies (DSAs). 3/14 patients (21%) not on EBT developed de novo DSAs. The incidence of rejection in those on EBT was 5/18 (28%), as compared with 7/13 (54%) not on EBT. In conclusion, our data, while limited by an inevitably small sample size and differences in the date of transplantation, do suggest that long-term automated EBT post renal transplant is effective and safe, with improvement in graft and patient outcomes and no increase in antibody formation or graft rejection.
28544309	Increased complications of chronic erythrocytapheresis compared with manual exchange transfusions in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk of strokes and are frequently treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. The goal is to suppress hemoglobin (Hb) S while minimizing transfusion-induced iron overload. RBCs may be given via simple transfusion, manual exchange transfusion (MET), or erythrocytapheresis (aRBCX). Chronic transfusion practices vary among institutions. METHODS: This single-institution, retrospective cohort study compares Hb S control and therapy complication rates between MET and aRBCX in a cohort of children and adolescents with SCD and stroke during a 5-year period from 2008 through 2012. Duration and mode of transfusion therapy, achievement of Hb S suppression goal, iron burden by ferritin levels, and catheter complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-seven children were included in analysis. The prevalence of catheter complications was 75% in aRBCX recipients compared with 0% in MET recipients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between modalities in achieving Hb S suppression or ferritin goals, but those receiving aRBCX had a greater likelihood of discontinuing chelation therapy. Among aRBCX recipients, adherence to >90% of transfusion appointments was associated with achieving Hb S suppression goals. CONCLUSION: aRBCX may have increased complication risks compared with MET for chronic transfusion therapy in SCD. Risks and benefits of aRBCX and MET should be considered when selecting a chronic transfusion modality. Transfusion therapy modalities should be compared in prospective studies for stroke prevention in children with SCD.
35894560	High-Priced Sickle Cell Gene Therapies Threaten to Exacerbate US Health Disparities and Establish New Pricing Precedents for Molecular Medicine. Gene therapies to treat sickle cell disease are in development and are expected to have high costs. The large eligible population size - by far, the largest for a gene therapy - poses daunting budget challenges and threatens to exacerbate health disparities for Black patients, who make up the vast majority of American sickle cell patients.
38161155	Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain. Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
38205646	Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.
32367470	[Pain management in sickle cell disease]. Sickle cell disease is associated with numerous symptoms and complications. Acute painful crisis is the most characteristic manifestation of the disease. In addition, many patients report chronic pain. As both acute and chronic pain severely diminish quality of life, adequate pain management is crucial. Recommendations for the treatment of acute painful crises are based on the World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which has been developed for cancer-related pain. Chronic pain can be treated with basic long-acting opioids and on-demand short-acting opioids. If patients show signs of neuropathic pain, administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants or possibly ketamine should be considered.

29377292	Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficient red blood cell units are associated with decreased posttransfusion red blood cell survival in children with sickle cell disease. Chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) reduces disease morbidity by suppressing the amount of circulating hemoglobin S (HbS)-containing red blood cells (RBC). The effectiveness of CTT depends on the rate of RBC clearance. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient donor RBC may exhibit increased hemolysis, but it is unknown if transfusion of these units results in less effective transfusion outcomes in SCD. Children with SCD on CTT were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. G6PD activity of transfused units was measured prior to expiration date. HbA clearance (DeltaHbA) was calculated as the difference of estimated posttransfusion HbA to the pretransfusion HbA of the subsequent transfusion episode. Sixty-two patients received 388 transfusions. Of 755 RBC units, 687 (91%) had normal G6PD (>60% activity), 38 (5%) had moderately low G6PD (10-60% activity), and 30 (4%) had severely low G6PD (<10% activity). Of 358 evaluable transfusions, 54 (15%) included >=1 G6PD deficient units, and 22 (6%) had >=1 severely deficient units. The proportion of the transfusion episode consisting of G6PD deficient units was associated with increased DeltaHbA for all G6PD deficient units (P = .05) and for severely G6PD deficient units (P = .0070). In multivariate mixed effects modeling, DeltaHbA was positively associated with severely G6PD deficient units (P = .0074) and RBC alloimmunization (P = .03) and negatively associated with recipient splenectomy (P = .015). Higher DeltaHbA was associated with higher HbS and reticulocyte counts at the subsequent transfusion episode. In conclusion, G6PD deficient RBC transfusions may have shorter in vivo survival and adversely affect the suppression of sickle erythropoiesis.

35724398	COVID19 vaccination in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated with increases in rates of pain crisis. ABSTRACTPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are more vulnerable to hospitalization, pneumonia, and pain following COVID-19 infection. However, given the association between the inflammatory response and vaso-occlusive crises in SCD and a case report of vaso-occlusive crises following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCov-195-7/AstraZeneca vaccine, there is concern that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in people with SCD might provoke a vaso-occlusive crisis. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to examine acute care usage for vaso-occlusive crisis and frequency and severity of side effects following COVID-19 vaccination among patients at the Montefiore Sickle Cell Center for Adults. As part of regular care, patients were asked if they had received COVID-19 vaccination and any side effects were noted. Electronic medical records were reviewed for the type of vaccine, dates received, episodes of vaso-occlusive crises within seven days of a dose, and side effects noted. The risk of average hospital utilization per week in 2019 was calculated as a baseline. We found that fewer than 1 in 10 patients presented to the hospital within seven days of vaccination and that the risk of hospital utilization was similar to the average risk in a week in 2019. Of patients who reported side effects, one reported a possible case of sensorineural hearing loss otherwise no other rare side effects, including thrombosis or death, were reported.
33128443	Emergence of gram-negative organisms as the cause of infections in patients with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease are at higher risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria due to immature immune responses and functional asplenia. We aimed to study our patient population for the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis and document a vast decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia rates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 158 patients with sickle cell disease registered at our hospital. Over a period of 13 years, every patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with fever had their medical record reviewed for blood cultures, wound cultures, and magnetic resonance imaging results for osteomyelitis. RESULTS: The number of patients presenting to the ED with fever was 105, with 581 febrile episodes and 893 blood cultures. Among those, no culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 grew coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.5%), one grew Salmonella enterica Paratyphi B, and three grew Salmonella enterica group C (in the same patient). The total number of osteomyelitis episodes in patients with sickle cell disease presenting with fever and documented by imaging was nine (1.5%). In patients with osteomyelitis, organisms were isolated in four patients (44%), including Enterobacter cloacae, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica group C. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and the use of prophylactic penicillin has virtually eliminated pneumococcal bacteremia among our patients. We observed the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.

35385685	Of mice and men: From hematopoiesis in mouse models to curative gene therapy for sickle cell disease. Through studies in mice and in humans, Stuart Orkin showed that GATA-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis. He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin's contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease.
28295188	How we manage iron overload in sickle cell patients. Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.
32516073	Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Surgical Shunts in Men with Ischemic Priapism. PURPOSE: Ischemic priapism is a urological emergency that requires prompt intervention to preserve erectile function. Characteristics that influence escalation to surgical intervention remain unclear. We identified factors and developed machine learning models to predict which men presenting with ischemic priapism will require shunting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified men with ischemic priapism admitted to the emergency department of our large county hospital between January 2010 and June 2019. We collected patient demographics, etiology, duration of priapism prior to intervention, interventions attempted and escalation to shunting. Machine learning models were trained and tested using R to predict which patients require surgical shunting. RESULTS: A total of 334 encounters of ischemic priapism were identified. The majority resolved with intracavernosal phenylephrine injection and/or cavernous aspiration (78%). Shunting was required in 10% of men. Median duration of priapism before intervention was longer for men requiring shunting than for men who did not (48 vs 7 hours, p=0.030). Patients with sickle cell disease as the etiology were less likely to require shunting compared to all other etiologies (2.2% vs 15.2%, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Men with longer duration of priapism before treatment more often underwent shunting. However, phenylephrine injection and aspiration remained effective for priapism lasting more than 36 hours. Having sickle cell disease as the etiology of priapism was protective against requiring shunting. We developed artificial intelligence models that performed with 87.2% accuracy and created an online probability calculator to determine which patients with ischemic priapism may require shunting.
36996737	Non-pharmacological pain interventions for sickle cell crisis in pediatrics: A scoping review. PROBLEM: Sickle cell crises (SCC) are recurrent, severe pain episodes experienced by people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Non-pharmacological interventions have been recommended for SCC pain management however, little is known about the impact of these interventions on SCC pain. This scoping review aims to systematically identify evidence on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for pain management during SCC in the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they are published in English and focusing on the use of any non-pharmacological interventions on pain during SCC in pediatric patients. Nine databases were searched including Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. Also, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched. SAMPLE: The database searching yielded 1517 studies. After the title and abstract screening, 1348 studies were excluded, and 169 full texts were retrieved and screened. One study was identified through handsearching. Finally, 27 articles were included in this scoping review. RESULTS: Across all studies, 27 different non-pharmacological interventions were identified. There were inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of virtual reality, guided imagery, and cognitive-behavioral interventions in experimental studies. The most common interventions used at home were prayer, massage, and distraction. The main interventions used in hospitals were prayer and fluid intake, but this was explored by a few studies. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients use numerous non-pharmacological interventions to manage pain during SCC. However, the impact of many interventions on SCC pain has not been empirically investigated. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on SCC pain.
33494879	Transfusion and Cellular Therapy in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Alloimmunization and iron overload remain significant complications of transfusion therapy and are minimized with prophylactic Rh and K antigen RBC matching and iron chelation. Matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a curative therapeutic option. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has recently shown great promise, for which obtaining sufficient HSCs is essential for success. This article discusses RBC transfusion indications and complications, transfusion support during HSCT, and HSC mobilization and collection for autologous HSCT with gene therapy.
34847228	Deferiprone vs deferoxamine for transfusional iron overload in SCD and other anemias: a randomized, open-label noninferiority study. Many people with sickle cell disease (SCD) or other anemias require chronic blood transfusions, which often causes iron overload that requires chelation therapy. The iron chelator deferiprone is frequently used in individuals with thalassemia syndromes, but data in patients with SCD are limited. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in patients with SCD or other anemias receiving chronic transfusion therapy. A total of 228 patients (mean age: 16.9 [range, 3-59] years; 46.9% female) were randomized to receive either oral deferiprone (n = 152) or subcutaneous deferoxamine (n = 76). The primary endpoint was change from baseline at 12 months in liver iron concentration (LIC), assessed by R2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The least squares mean (standard error) change in LIC was -4.04 (0.48) mg/g dry weight for deferiprone vs -4.45 (0.57) mg/g dry weight for deferoxamine, with noninferiority of deferiprone to deferoxamine demonstrated by analysis of covariance (least squares mean difference 0.40 [0.56]; 96.01% confidence interval, -0.76 to 1.57). Noninferiority of deferiprone was also shown for both cardiac T2* MRI and serum ferritin. Rates of overall adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal did not differ significantly between the groups. AEs related to deferiprone treatment included abdominal pain (17.1% of patients), vomiting (14.5%), pyrexia (9.2%), increased alanine transferase (9.2%) and aspartate transferase levels (9.2%), neutropenia (2.6%), and agranulocytosis (0.7%). The efficacy and safety profiles of deferiprone were acceptable and consistent with those seen in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This trial study was registered at www://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02041299.
32716555	Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.

29556958	Effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants in patients with sickle cell disease and venous thromboembolism: a retrospective cohort study. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience initial and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) more commonly and at a younger age than the general population, and it confers a higher mortality for patients with SCD. However, limited evidence is available to guide anticoagulant use for VTE treatment in this population. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and warfarin for VTE treatment among patients with SCD. This single-center retrospective study includes adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with VTE. Data was obtained from review of electronic health records for the 6 months after VTE diagnosis. Among the 22 patients treated initially with a DOAC, 6 (27%) developed recurrent VTE, none experienced major bleeding, and 3 (14%) experienced clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). Similarly, of 15 patients initially treated with warfarin, 3 (20%) developed a recurrent VTE, 1 (7%) experienced major bleeding, and 2 (13%) experienced CRNMB. Twelve patients received more than one oral anticoagulant during the study period, most commonly due to a recurrent VTE, concern for non-adherence, or subtherapeutic INR. Overall, the incidence of VTE recurrence and bleeding events were similar between groups, but occurred at a higher rate than those found in major clinical trials of anticoagulant agents. Prescribers should continue to individualize therapeutic decision-making regarding oral anticoagulant therapy for VTE treatment for individuals with SCD based on patient-specific factors and anticipated ability to adhere to the drug regimen or required monitoring.

30951023	Nucleated Red Blood Cells in Children With Sickle Cell Disease Hospitalized for Pain. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) and transfusion requirements are common and difficult to predict during hospitalizations for acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) among individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study examined the relationship between nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) counts during hospitalization for VOE and development of ACS or transfusion requirement among children with SCD. Retrospective chart review was performed for 264 encounters of patients with SCD hospitalized for uncomplicated VOE who had NRBC count data at admission during a 5-year period. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship of admission and change in NRBC ([INCREMENT]NRBC) to ACS/transfusion requirement. Overall, 44 of 264 (16.7%) encounters resulted in ACS, transfusion, or both. Admission NRBC was not associated with development of ACS/transfusion requirement. Among 125 of 264 (47.3%) encounters in which a subsequent CBC was obtained, greater increases in NRBCs and greater decrease in hemoglobin were significantly associated with ACS/transfusion requirement (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.16, 6.35; P=0.02 and OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.08, 5.89; P=0.03, respectively). Our finding that an increase in NRBC counts was associated with development of ACS/transfusion requirement suggests that [INCREMENT]NRBCs may represent a useful biomarker for predicting complications in children with SCD hospitalized for VOE.
31742673	Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in a person who has inherited two mutant globin genes (one from each parent), at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, and SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are attributable to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back or chest, but it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction to rehydrating the patient and reduce the sickling process. OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions to treat acute painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid and LILACS, from inception to September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of pharmacological interventions, of any dose and by any route, compared to placebo or any active comparator, for the treatment (not prevention) of painful sickle cell VOC in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies with data for 638 VOC events and 594 participants aged 17 to 42 years with SCD presenting to a hospital emergency department in a painful VOC. Three studies investigated a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) compared to placebo. One study compared an opioid with a placebo, two studies compared an opioid with an active comparator, two studies compared an anticoagulant with a placebo, and one study compared a combination of three drugs with a combination of four drugs. Risk of bias across the nine studies varied. Studies were primarily at an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias. Studies were primarily at a high risk of bias for size with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm; two studies had 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm (unclear risk). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The efficacy was uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved, and PGIC much or very much improved (no difference; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-quality evidence). Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the NSAIDs group (16/45 adverse events, 1/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events) and the placebo group (19/45 adverse events, 2/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events). Opioids compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30%, PGIC, or adverse events (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events). Opioids compared with active comparator No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The results were uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved (33% of the opioids group versus 19% of the placebo group). No data were reported regarding PGIC much or very much improved. Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the opioids group (9/66 adverse events, and 0/66 serious adverse events) and the placebo group (7/64 adverse events, 0/66 serious adverse events). No data were reported regarding withdrawal due to adverse events. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality because there are too few data to have confidence in results (e.g. too few participants per treatment arm). Where no data were reported for an outcome, we had no evidence to support or refute (quality of the evidence is unknown). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identified only nine studies, with insufficient data for all pharmacological interventions for analysis. The available evidence is very uncertain regarding the efficacy or harm from pharmacological interventions used to treat pain related to sickle cell VOC in adults. This area could benefit most from more high quality, certain evidence, as well as the establishment of suitable registries which record interventions and outcomes for this group of people.
30616959	"More efficient exchange of sickle red blood cells can be achieved by exchanging the densest red blood cells: An ex vivo proof of concept study. BACKGROUND: In sickle cell disease (SCD), red blood cells (RBCs) containing hemoglobin S can be denser than RBCs containing wild-type hemoglobin, especially when dehydrated. We hypothesize that targeting denser RBCs during red blood cell (RBC) exchange for SCD could result in more efficient removal of dehydrated, sickled RBCs and preservation of non-sickled RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Waste products from RBC exchanges for SCD were used as ""simulated patients"". One RBC volume was exchanged using ABO-compatible blood. The apheresis instrument was programmed to exchange the entire RBC layer by indicating the hematocrit (control), or the bottom half by indicating the hematocrit was half the hematocrit (experimental), with or without subsequent transfusion. Hemoglobin S levels, and complete blood counts were measured. RESULTS: Hemoglobin S levels were lower after the modified versus control RBC exchange (post-RBC exchange mean 4.96% and 11.27%); total hemoglobin S amounts were also lower (mean 19.27 and 58.29 mL of RBCs). Mean RBC density decreased after the modified RBC exchange by 8.86%. Hematocrit decreased in the modified RBC exchange by 36.37%, with partial correction by direct transfusion following a truncated RBC exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting denser RBCs in RBC exchange enhanced hemoglobin S removal and decreased RBC density. Further development of this ex vivo model could potentially allow for: 1) improved reduction in hemoglobin S levels (allowing for longer periods between RBC exchange or maintained lower levels), or 2) achievement of previous goal hemoglobin S levels with fewer donor units (reducing alloimmunization risk and improving blood utilization)."
38289232	Blood Spotlight Review on Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease. The root cause of sickle cell anemia has been known for seven decades, yet no curative therapies have been available other than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, applicability is limited. Two potentially curative therapies based on gene therapy and gene editing strategies are about to enter the final stages of the FDA approval process. This review surveys the nature of these therapies and the opportunities and issues raised by the prospect of definitive genetically based therapies being available in clinical practice.
32147028	Acupuncture for pediatric sickle cell pain management: A promising non-opioid therapy. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of acupuncture for pain management in children with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of a single-institution experience on the use of acupuncture in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease was evaluated between 2012-2019. Demographic characteristics, presenting pain location, pain scores pre- and post-acupuncture, and adverse events were collected. SETTING: Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital Pediatric Hematology outpatient and inpatient units. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture was performed by six licensed acupuncturists. Point prescriptions were based on pain location, philosophies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Japanese Style of Kiiko Matsumoto acupuncture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain reduction as measured by two Verbal Pain Scales. RESULTS: Ninety acupuncture treatments were administered to twenty-four patients with sickle cell disease: median age 17.5 years, 62 % female, 37.5 % African American, 50 % Hispanic. The mean treatment duration was 18.5 +- 4.8 min. Fifty-five treatments had documented pre/post-acupuncture pain scores. Pain reduction was achieved in 65.5 % of these treatments. A 0-10 pain scale used in 13 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture score of 7.31 +- 1.75, post-acupuncture score of 6.08 +- 1.85, and a mean pain score change of 1.23 +- 1.09 (p = 0.11); A 0-4 pain scale used in 42 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture pain score of 3.31 +- 0.72, post-acupuncture score of 2.33 +- 0.98, and a mean pain score change of 0.98 +- 0.99 (p < 0.0001). No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy decreased pain for our patients with sickle cell disease, providing a safe non-opioid therapeutic option.

31803937	Treatment for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent and severe complication of sickle cell disease and its treatment is not standardised. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of any surgical procedure compared with other surgical interventions or non-surgical procedures, on avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease in terms of efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from both ongoing trial registries and the reference lists of papers identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials comparing specific therapies for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Given only one trial was identified, meta-analyses were not possible. MAIN RESULTS: One trial (46 participants) was eligible for inclusion. After randomization eight participants were withdrawn, mainly because they declined to participate in the trial. Data were analysed for 38 participants at the end of the trial. After a mean follow-up of three years, hip core decompression and physical therapy did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone using the score from the original trial (an improvement of 18.1 points for those treated with intervention therapy versus an improvement of 15.7 points with control therapy). We are very uncertain whether there is any difference between groups regarding major complications (hip pain, risk ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.60; vaso-occlusive crises, risk ratio 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.80; very low quality of evidence); and acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.56; very low quality of evidence)). This trial did not report results on mortality or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that adding hip core decompression to physical therapy achieves clinical improvement in people with sickle cell disease with avascular necrosis of bone compared to physical therapy alone. However, we highlight that our conclusion is based on one trial with high attrition rates. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the role of hip-core depression for this clinical condition. Endpoints should focus on participants' subjective experience (e.g. quality of life and pain) as well as more objective 'time-to-event' measures (e.g. mortality, survival, hip longevity). The availability of participants to allow adequate trial power will be a key consideration for endpoint choice.
28853040	State of the Art Management of Acute Vaso-occlusive Pain in Sickle Cell Disease. Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Multiple complex pathophysiological processes can result in pain during a VOC. Despite significant improvements in the understanding and management of SCD, little progress has been made in the management of pain in SCD, although new treatments are being explored. Opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the mainstay of treatment of VOC pain, but new classes of drugs are being tested to prevent and treat acute pain. Advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and pain and the pharmacogenomics of opioids have yet to be effectively utilized in the management of VOC. Opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia are significant problems associated with the long-term use of opioids, and better strategies for chronic pain therapy are needed. This report reviews the mechanisms of pain associated with acute VOC, describes the current management of VOC, and describes some of the new therapies under evaluation for the management of acute VOC in SCD.
32034776	Curative options for sickle cell disease: haploidentical stem cell transplantation or gene therapy? Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the lack of available matched donors makes this therapy out of reach for the majority of patients with SCD. Alternative donor sources such as haploidentical HSCT expand the donor pool to nearly all patients with SCD, with recent data showing high overall survival, limited toxicities, and effective reduction in acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Simultaneously, multiple gene therapy strategies are entering clinical trials with preliminary data showing their success, theoretically offering all patients yet another curative strategy without the morbidity and mortality of GVHD. As improvements are made for alternative donors in the allogeneic setting and as data emerge from gene therapy trials, the optimal curative strategy for any individual patient with SCD will be determined by many critical factors including efficacy, transplant morbidity and mortality, safety, patient disease status and preference, cost and applicability. Haploidentical may be the preferred choice now based mostly on availability of data; however, gene therapy is closing the gap and may ultimately prove to be the better option. Progress in both strategies, however, makes cure more attainable for the individual with SCD.
36994864	Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain in children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) leading to hospitalization, psychological sequelae and a decreased health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing sickle cell related pain in children with SCD. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive literature search up until October 2022 was performed to identify studies that investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on (1) pain frequency and/or intensity, and (2) analgesic and health service use in children with SCD until the age of 21. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designed (QED) studies were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten articles (five RCTs and five QED studies) with 422 participants were included. They investigated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 5), biofeedback (n = 2), massage (n = 1), virtual reality (n = 1) and yoga (n = 1). The majority of the interventions were psychological (n = 7) and were performed in the outpatient clinic (n = 6). CBT and biofeedback significantly reduced frequency and/or intensity of SCD-related pain in outpatient settings, while virtual reality and yoga significantly reduced pain in inpatient settings. Biofeedback also significantly reduced analgesic use. None of the included articles reported reduced health service use. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions may be effective in reducing pain in paediatric patients with SCD. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies a quantitative analysis could not be performed. Awaiting further supporting evidence, healthcare providers should consider implementing these interventions as valuable part of a comprehensive pain management strategy plan.
28249145	Gene Therapy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease results from a homozygous missense mutation in the beta-globin gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin S. Gene therapy for patients with this disorder is complicated by the complex cellular abnormalities and challenges in achieving effective, persistent inhibition of polymerization of hemoglobin S. We describe our first patient treated with lentiviral vector-mediated addition of an antisickling beta-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Adverse events were consistent with busulfan conditioning. Fifteen months after treatment, the level of therapeutic antisickling beta-globin remained high (approximately 50% of beta-like-globin chains) without recurrence of sickle crises and with correction of the biologic hallmarks of the disease.

32259777	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease. Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Clinical Oncology each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.

29313508	Evaluation of transfusion practices in sickle cell disease in Senegal: cohort study of 1078 patients with sickle cell disease. Blood transfusion is an essential therapeutic tool in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Its indications and modalities vary from one country to another as a function of the clinical severity of the disease and the availability of blood products. This study seeks to evaluate the frequency and modalities of blood transfusions as well as their indications in patients with sickle cell syndrome at the Dakar hematology department from 1995 through 2015. This retrospective study reviewed the records of a cohort of 1078 patients with SS, SC, Sbeta0 and Sbeta + thalassemia sickle cell syndromes and collected data about the type of blood products, indications, modalities, and acute transfusion complications. The frequency of transfusion was adjusted for age, sex, and sickle cell profile. The patients' mean age was 23 years (2-44 years) and the sex ratio 0.9. SS disease was predominant (87.4 %); 28.5% had transfusions during the study period. Patients older than 20 years received more transfusions (P = 0.047). The frequency of transfusions did not differ significantly by gender (P = 0.12), but did by profile: a higher percentage of patients with SS disease required transfusion (P = 0.043). Acute anemia was the most common indication for transfusion (50.03 %). Acute transfusion complications were rare (5.8 %). This study shows that less than one third of sickle cell anemia patients in Senegal have transfusions, a finding that confirms that our patients have fewer transfusions than patients in other countries in Africa or in the West. This limited use of transfusion therapy may be related to a less severe level of disease among patients in Senegal, but also to the availability of blood products.
33711512	Pain in sickle cell disease: current and potential translational therapies. Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD. In this review, we outline the challenges and need for validation of side-effects of opioids and provide an update on the development of mechanism-based translational therapies, specifically targeting pain in SCD.
31026251	Health-related Quality of Life in Children With Sickle Cell Disease Undergoing Chronic Red Cell Transfusion Therapy. Chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy is one of few disease-modifying treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD). This study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQL) in children receiving CRCT relative to 2 comparison groups: children with similar, severe SCD and children with milder disease risk defined by SCD genotype. For this study, 67 children with SCD between the ages of 8 and 18 completed the self-report Pediatric Quality of Life Sickle Cell Disease module (PedsQL SCD) as part of a pilot clinical program during routine hematologic visits. A medical chart review was also performed. Linear regression suggested that children in the CRCT group had significantly higher self-reported HRQL ratings for domains related to pain, F2,64=4.07 (P=0.022) and pain-related functioning, F2,64=4.32 (P=0.017), compared with children with similar and milder disease risk. Exploratory analyses implied that children in the CRCT group also had fewer worries about SCD-related complications, F3,63=9.68 (P<0.001). These patient-perceived benefits of CRCT may have important implications for treatment decisions and for providing ancillary support for children with SCD and their families.

31045749	Do chronic pain and comorbidities affect brain function in sickle cell patients? A systematic review of neuroimaging and treatment approaches. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a medical condition in which chronic pain is common and negatively impacts psychosocial function and quality of life. Although the brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain are well studied in other painful conditions, the brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain and the associated psychosocial comorbidities are not well established in SCD. A growing literature demonstrates the effect of treatment of chronic pain, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, on brain function. The present systematic review aimed to (1) determine the effects of chronic pain and psychosocial comorbidities on brain function of patients with SCD; (2) summarize pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to treat these symptoms; and (3) identify areas for further investigation of potential beneficial effects of treatments on brain function. Titles were screened using predefined criteria, including SCD, and abstracts and full texts were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 1167 SCD articles were identified, and 86 full articles were included covering 3 sections: chronic pain (4 studies), psychosocial comorbidities (11 studies), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments (71 studies). Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates aberrant neural processing related to chronic pain and psychosocial comorbidities in SCD beyond ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. Although neuroimaging studies show an important role for psychological factors, pain management is nearly exclusively based on opioids. Behavior therapy seems useful to improve psychological symptoms as well as chronic pain and quality of life. Further investigation is required with larger cohorts, matched controls, and examination of treatment-related neural mechanisms.
36516084	Outcomes following posttransplant viral-specific T-cell therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a curative approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). With the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), especially in the HLA-mismatched donors, intense immunosuppression is required leading to an increased risk of viral infection. Post-HSCT, adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell (VSTs) therapies have not been well-studied in SCD patients. Here, we report the outcomes of patients with SCD at a single-center who received VSTs post-transplant to prevent or treat virus infections. Thirteen patients who received HSCT from HLA-matched (n=9) or mismatched (n=4) donors for SCD were treated with a total of 15 VST products for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple viruses (cytomegalovirus, ebstein barr virus, adenovirus, BK virus, human herpes virus 6 +/- human parainfluenza virus 3). Of the patients evaluated, 46.2% (n=6)) received VSTs as treatment of virus infection. Eighty percent of patients with active viremia (n=4/5) achieved remission of at least 1 target virus. Seven additional patients (53.8%) received VSTs prophylactically and 6/7 (85.7%) remained virus-free post-infusion. No immediate infusion-related toxicities occurred, and severe de novo acute GVHD occurred in only 2 (15.4%) patients. Given the good safety profile, high-rate of clinical responses and sustained remissions when administered with standard anti-viral treatments, the routine use of VSTs post-HSCT as prophylaxis or treatment may improve the overall safety of transplant for patients with SCD.
28094851	Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease. BACKROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 04 April 2016.We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease.Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents).The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusionsLong-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence.Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants)We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence.Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks).The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelationNeither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants)Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants)Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence.We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease.In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications.In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration.In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events.All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.
30095751	How Sickle Cell Disease Impairs Skeletal Muscle Function: Implications in Daily Life. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent life-threatening genetic hemoglobinopathy in the world and occurs due to the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). hemoglobin S-containing red blood cells (RBC) are fragile, leading to hemolysis and anemia, and adhere to the endothelium, leading to hemorheological and hemodynamical disturbances. In its deoxygenated form, HbS may polymerize, leading to sickling of red blood cells and potentially to vasoocclusive crises. Recent findings observed that SCD patients demonstrate significant skeletal muscle remodeling and display reduced muscle functional capacities, contributing to exercise intolerance and poor quality of life. Although acute high-intensity exercise is not recommended for SCD patients because it may increase the risk of sickling, regular moderate-intensity physical activity could have beneficial effects on skeletal muscle and more generally on the well-being of SCD patients. This article reviews the literature regarding the impact of the disease on muscular tissue characteristics and function, as well as the corresponding implications for SCD patients' quality of life.

28821470	Design of the DREPAGREFFE trial: A prospective controlled multicenter study evaluating the benefit of genoidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation over chronic transfusion in sickle cell anemia children detected to be at risk of stroke by transcranial Doppler (NCT 01340404). BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have an 11% risk of stroke by the age of 18. Chronic transfusion applied in patients detected to be at risk by transcranial Doppler allows a significant reduction of stroke risk. However, chronic transfusion exposes to several adverse events, including alloimmunization and iron overload, and is not curative. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allows termination of the transfusion program, but its benefit has not been demonstrated. DESIGN: DREPAGREFFE (NCT01340404) is a multicenter, prospective trial enrolling SCA children younger than 15years receiving chronic transfusion due to a history of abnormal transcranial Doppler (velocities >=200cm/s). Only those with at least one non-SCA sibling and parents accepting HLA-typing and transplantation with a genoidentical donor were eligible. Chronic transfusion was pursued in patients with no available donor, whereas others were transplanted. Comparison between the 2 arms (transfusion vs transplantation) was analyzed using both genetic randomization and propensity-score matching as a sensitivity analysis. The primary end-point was the velocity measure at 1year. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and stenoses, cognitive performance in comparison with siblings, allo-immunization, iron-overload, phosphatidyl-serine, angiogenesis/hypoxia, brain injury-related factor expression, quality of life and cost. OBJECTIVES: To show that genoidentical transplantation decreases velocities significantly more than chronic transfusion in SCA children at risk of stroke. DISCUSSION: DREPAGREFFE is the first prospective study to evaluate transplantation in SCA children. It compares the outcome of cerebral vasculopathy following genoidentical transplantation versus chronic transfusion using genetic randomization and causal inference methods.
30324698	Differential cerebral hemometabolic responses to blood transfusions in adults and children with sickle cell anemia. BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions are administered to children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) for secondary stroke prevention, or as treatment for recurrent pain crises or acute anemia, but transfusion effects on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism are not well-characterized. PURPOSE: To compare blood transfusion-induced changes in hemometabolic parameters, including oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), within and between adults and children with SCA. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, longitudinal study. SUBJECTS: Adults with SCA (n = 16) receiving simple (n = 7) or exchange (n = 9) transfusions and children with SCA (n = 11) receiving exchange transfusions were scanned once when hematocrit was near nadir and again within 7 days of transfusion. Adult controls without SCA or sickle trait (n = 7) were scanned twice on separate days. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T T1 -weighted, T2 -weighted, and T2 -relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) imaging, and phase contrast angiography. ASSESSMENT: Global OEF was computed as the relative difference between venous oxygenation (from TRUST) and arterial oxygenation (from pulse oximetry). Global CBF was computed as total blood flow to the brain normalized by intracranial tissue volume. STATISTICAL TESTS: Hemometabolic variables were compared using two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; associations were analyzed using two-sided Spearman's correlation testing. RESULTS: In adults with SCA, posttransfusion OEF = 0.38 +- 0.05 was lower (P = 0.001) than pretransfusion OEF = 0.45 +- 0.09. A change in OEF was correlated with increases in hematocrit (P = 0.02; rho = -0.62) and with pretransfusion hematocrit (P = 0.02; rho = 0.65). OEF changes after transfusion were greater (P = 0.002) in adults receiving simple versus exchange transfusions. Posttransfusion CBF = 77.7 +- 26.4 ml/100g/min was not different (P = 0.27) from pretransfusion CBF = 82.3 +- 30.2 ml/100g/min. In children with SCA, both posttransfusion OEF = 0.28 +- 0.04 and CBF = 76.4 +- 26.4 were lower than pretransfusion OEF = 0.36 +- 0.06 (P = 0.004) and CBF = 96.4 +- 16.5 (P = 0.004). DATA CONCLUSION: Cerebral OEF reduces following transfusions in adults and children with SCA. CBF reduces following transfusions more often in children compared to adults, indicating that vascular reserve capacity may remain near exhaustion posttransfusion in many adults.

28802541	Opioid doses and acute care utilization outcomes for adults with sickle cell disease: ED versus acute care unit. BACKGROUND: Acute care units (ACUs) with focused sickle cell disease (SCD) care have been shown to effectively address pain and limit hospitalizations compared to emergency departments (ED), the reason for differences in admission rates is understudied. Our aim was compare effects of usual care for adult SCD pain in ACU and ED on opioid doses and discharge pain ratings, hospital admission rates and lengths of stay. METHODS: In a retrospective, comparative cohort, single academic tertiary center study, 148 adults with sickle cell pain received care in the ED, ACU or both. From the medical records we documented opioid doses, unit discharge pain ratings, hospital admission rates, and lengths of stay. FINDINGS: Pain on admission to the ED averaged 8.7+-1.5 and to the ACU averaged 8.0+-1.6. The average pain on discharge from the ED was 6.4+-3.0 and for the ACU was 4.5+-2.5. 70% of the 144 ED visits resulted in hospital admissions as compared to 37% of the 73 ACU visits. Admissions from the ED or ACU had similar inpatient lengths of stay. Significant differences between ED and ACU in first opioid dose and hourly opioid dose were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Applying guidelines for higher dosing of opioids for acute painful episodes in adults with SCD in ACU was associated with improved pain outcomes and decreased hospitalizations, compared to ED. Adoption of this approach for SCD pain in ED may result in improved outcomes, including a decrease in hospital admissions.
32255722	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease. Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and ASCO each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.

30153113	Effective Pain Management After Total Hip Arthroplasty in a Sickle Cell Patient Emphasizing Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate/Methylprednisolone Acetate Administered via a Peripheral Nerve Blockade: A Case Report. Pain control after total hip arthroplasty in sickle cell patients is challenging yet essential to prevent sickle cell crises or protracted hospital stays. We present a case of effective analgesia that lasted for weeks in a young opioid-tolerant female. This was achieved by the administration of glucocorticoids with different durations of action, dexamethasone sodium phosphate/methylprednisolone acetate, via a femoral/lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block placed preoperatively. Postoperatively, the patient's opioid demand was unchanged from her preoperative baseline. She met all the discharge requirements, including physical therapy targets, on postoperative day 2 and did not have any complications during the hospitalization.
29977264	Impact of aerobic exercises on selected inflammatory markers and immune system response among patients with sickle cell anemia in asymptomatic steady state. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is well recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease. Despite progress in therapy, SCA remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The relationship between exercise and immune function has been of great interest to the scientific community and the lay public. The aim of this study was to measure the impact of aerobic exercise training on the immunologic parameters and inflammatory cytokines of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in asymptomatic steady state. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty asymptomatic sickle cell anemia patients were involved in this study, their age ranged from 25- 40 years and were assigned to two sub-groups; group (A) received aerobic exercise training for 12 weeks, however group (B) received no training intervention for 12 weeks. Parameters of CD3, CD4 and CD8 were quantified, Leukocyte, differential counts, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured before and after 12 weeks, at the end of the study. RESULTS: The mean values of CD3, CD4 and CD8, leukocyte, monocytes counts, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased in group (A), while group (B) showed non-significant changes in these parameters. Also; there were significant differences between mean levels of the investigated parameters in group (A) and group (B) after treatment. CONCLUSION: The current study provides evidence that aerobic exercise training improves inflammatory markers and immune system in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in asymptomatic steady state.
32681734	Muscle structural, energetic and functional benefits of endurance exercise training in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients display skeletal muscle hypotrophy, altered oxidative capacity, exercise intolerance and poor quality of life. We previously demonstrated that moderate-intensity endurance training is beneficial for improving muscle function and quality of life of patients. The present study evaluated the effects of this moderate-intensity endurance training program on skeletal muscle structural and metabolic properties. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets were obtained from 33. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the non-training (n = 18) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental cycling tests were performed before and after the training program. Endurance training increased type I muscle fiber surface area (P = .038), oxidative enzyme activity [citrate synthase, P < .001; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, P = .009; type-I fiber cytochrome c oxidase, P = .042; respiratory chain complex IV, P = .017] and contents of respiratory chain complexes I (P = .049), III (P = .005), IV (P = .003) and V (P = .002). Respiratory frequency, respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate concentration and rating of perceived exertion were all lower at a given submaximal power output after training vs non-training group (all P < .05). The muscle content of proteins involved in glucose transport and pH regulation were unchanged in the training group relative to the non-training group. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise program improved exercise capacity and muscle structural and oxidative properties. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.
32892842	Transfusion support in patients with sickle cell disease. Blood transfusions are an integral component of the management of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Red cells can be administered as a simple transfusion, part of a modified exchange procedure involving manual removal of autologous red cells and infusion of donor red cells, and part of an automated red cell exchange procedure using apheresis techniques. Individuals with sickle cell disease are at risk of multiple complications of blood transfusions, including transfusional hemosiderosis, auto- and alloimmunization to minor red cell and human leukocyte antigens, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and hyper-hemolysis. In low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where a directed donor system is prevalent and limited laboratory methods are in place to perform extended red cell phenotyping, leukodepletion of cellular products, and infectious disease screening, there are additional challenges to providing safe and adequate transfusion support for this patient population. We review current indications for acute and chronic transfusions in sickle cell disease that are derived primarily from randomized controlled trials and observational studies in children living in high-income countries. We will highlight populations with unique transfusion needs, such as pregnant women and children, as well as the role of the transfusion medicine consultative service for individuals with sickle cell disease planning to have curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Finally, we will discuss risk factors for alloimmunization in individuals with sickle cell disease, emerging new strategies to prevent alloimmunization in this population, and critical gaps in the implementation of transfusion guidelines for sickle cell disease in high- and low-income countries.
36775794	Complementary and alternative medicine for children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular alternative to opioid and other analgesics in sickle cell disease (SCD). We review the effectiveness, prevalence, and factors associated with CAM use in the pediatric SCD population. METHODS: The review protocol was created based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were examined. The prevalence of CAM use in pediatric patients with SCD ranged from 36 to 84.5%. Common inpatient CAM interventions were yoga, virtual reality, and acupuncture, which decreased pain scale scores. Outpatient CAMs were consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, massage therapy, and guided-imagery, which increased pain tolerability and decreased pain scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: CAM modalities can decrease pain scale scores. However, the impact of specific CAM modalities on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absences were inconclusive.
33560399	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with omidubicel in sickle cell disease. Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) do not have HLA-matched related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unrelated cord blood (UCB) is an alternative graft option but is historically associated with high graft failure rates, with inadequate cell dose a major limitation. Omidubicel is a nicotinamide-based, ex vivo-expanded UCB product associated with rapid engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that increasing the UCB cell dose with this strategy would lead to improved engraftment in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative HSCT for SCD. We report the outcomes of a phase 1/2 study in 13 patients with severe SCD who received omidubicel in combination with an unmanipulated UCB graft and 3 who received a single omidubicel graft. Grafts were minimally matched with patients at 4 of 6 HLA alleles. Median age at transplant was 13 years. A median CD34+ expansion of ~80-fold was observed in omidubicel and led to rapid neutrophil engraftment (median, 7 days). Long-term engraftment was derived from the unmanipulated graft in most of the double cord blood recipients. Two of the 3 single omidubicel recipients also had sustained engraftment. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was high, but resolved in all surviving patients. Event-free survival in the double cord group was 85% (median follow-up 4 years). All 3 patients in the single cord group were alive at 1 year after transplantation. Ex vivo expansion of UCB with omidubicel supports engraftment in patients with SCD. This approach to decreasing the incidence of GVHD should be optimized for general use in patients with SCD. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01590628.
30941859	Health literacy and knowledge of chronic transfusion therapy in adolescents with sickle cell disease and caregivers. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may require chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for prevention of stroke or other complications. Limited health literacy (HL) is common and is associated with poor health-related knowledge and outcomes in chronic disease. We sought to assess HL and transfusion knowledge in patients with SCD on CTT and their caregivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients was conducted in outpatient hematology clinics. Forty-five pairs of adolescent patients and caregivers and 20 caregivers of pre-adolescent patients completed the Newest Vital Sign HL assessment and answered questions assessing SCD and transfusion knowledge. Community-level median income and unemployment rates were estimated from Census data. We computed the correlation of HL with knowledge and compared each to Census variables, payor status, educational attainment, and stroke. RESULTS: HL was inadequate in 22 (34%) caregivers and 31 (69%) adolescents. Adequate caregiver HL was associated with higher educational attainment but not community-level socioeconomics or payor status. Mean knowledge score was lower in adolescents than in caregivers and correlated with age in adolescents (r = 0.42, P = .004). HL correlated with knowledge (r = 0.46, P < .0001). There were no significant correlations of HL or knowledge between adolescents and their caregivers. Neither HL nor knowledge was associated with prior stroke. The greatest knowledge was demonstrated for iron overload and SCD genotype, whereas knowledge gaps existed in alloimmunization, indication for CTT, and SCD curative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced educational resources in transfusion therapy, alloimmunization, and curative therapy are needed for patients with SCD and caregivers of all HL levels.
37248824	Pharmacogenetics of pain management in Zimbabwean patients with sickle cell disease. Background: Pain is a common cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Failure to effectively control pain remains a challenge in patient care. Materials & methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm  pharmacogenomics open array panel containing CYP2D6 and UGT genetic variants implicated in opioid response. Results: The reduced function alleles CYP2D6*17 and *29 had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. UGT2B7 rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p = 0.0454). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the role of UGT2B7 polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.
36354234	Safety of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in 213 adult patients with sickle cell disease. Given the lack of information about safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we sought to determine whether COVID-19 vaccine was associated with subsequent hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). We included 402 patients with SCD, including 88 regularly transfused. As of July 31, 2021, 213 (53.0%) of them had received a least one dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer 93.0%). We showed similar risk of hospital admission for a VOE among vaccinated patients (whether transfused or not) and among a control group of non-vaccinated patients matched for age, sex and genotype.
33897715	The Evolving Landscape of Biomarkers in Celiac Disease: Leading the Way to Clinical Development. Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disease characterized by abnormal T-cell responses to gluten. For many patients, symptoms and intestinal damage can be controlled by a gluten-free diet, but, for some, this approach is not enough, and celiac disease progresses, with serious medical consequences. Multiple therapies are now under development, increasing the need for biomarkers that allow identification of specific patient populations and monitoring of therapeutic activity and durability. The advantage of identifying biomarkers in celiac disease is that the underlying pathways driving disease are well characterized and the histological, cellular, and serological changes with gluten response have been defined in gluten challenge studies. However, there is room for improvement. Biomarkers that measure histological changes require duodenal biopsies and are invasive. Less invasive peripheral blood cell and cytokine biomarkers are transient and dependent upon gluten challenge. Here, we discuss established biomarkers and new approaches for biomarkers that may overcome current limitations.
31688364	Effect of a Gluten-free Diet on Quality of Life in Patients With Nonclassical Versus Classical Presentations of Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) often presents with symptoms of diarrhea and malabsorption, termed classical CD. However, it can also present as nonclassical CD, which is commonly associated with nongastrointestinal symptoms. Studies suggest that nonclassical CD tends to have less severe symptoms than classical CD, which may affect both adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and psychological stress. Therefore, we compared adherence to a GFD and psychological measures, including quality of life (QOL) and somatization, between patients with nonclassical and classical presentations of CD. METHODS: Patients at a tertiary care center with biopsy-proven CD, who completed a Talley Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the Short Form-36 at diagnosis and who had been on a GFD for at least 1 year, were included in this study. Patients were further surveyed to assess gastrointestinal symptoms, QOL, Somatization Symptom Checklist (SSC), and adherence to a GFD. Results were compared between patients with classical versus nonclassical CD presentation. RESULTS: Among 122 patients included in this study, 62 had classical CD and 60 had nonclassical CD. At diagnosis, health-related QOL was lower in the classical CD group than in the nonclassical CD group. After following a GFD, both groups had improved QOL after following a GFD, and body mass index significantly increased in both groups. Most subscales of QOL, SSC scores, and adherence to the GFD were similar between the groups, except the Short Form-36 Mental Component summary scores that were still lower in the classical CD (48.4 vs. 52.6 nonclassical CD group; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite QOL at diagnosis being higher in those with nonclassical CD versus lower in those with classical CD, both groups had improved QOL and achieved a similar QOL after following a GFD.
29561985	REVIEW OF CELIAC DISEASE PRESENTATION IN A PEDIATRIC TERTIARY CENTRE. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder with a multiform presentation and therefore a challenging diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose is to identify the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and histologic characteristics of children with celiac disease at diagnosis and on follow-up. METHODS: Children with previously established or newly diagnosed celiac disease, admitted in a tertiary centre in a two-year period (2014-2016) were recruited. Data was collected retrospectively from electronic medical records and clinical notes, and subsequently analysed with SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients, out of 312, were included. Age ranged from 1 to 17 years (mean +- SD: 8.5+-4.5 years, 69% girls). Disease presentation was classical in 60%, non-classical in 25%, subclinical in 10% and 5% classified as potential celiac disease. Non-classical and subclinical profiles had a higher mean age at presentation but not statistically significant (P-value 0.24). The most frequent gastrointestinal features at presentation were abdominal pain (58%), diarrhea (43%) and bloating (27%). A positive family history for celiac disease was present in 24% (n=35). We found anaemia in 23%, low ferritin in 63% and a moderate to severe deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 62%. celiac disease -specific serologic testing and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed in 99%. Histology revealed modified Marsh 2 or 3 enteropathy in 94%, the remaining had normal histology but positive human leukocyte antigen typing. Clinical improvement at 12 months of gluten-free diet was complete in 51% and partial in 49%. IgA tTG normalized after 12-30 months of gluten-free diet in 45%. On growth assessment at diagnosis and after 12-28 months of gluten-free diet, 100% had height increase (mean +-SD: 7.11+-4.43 cm) and 96% weight gain (mean +-SD: 5.60+-4.91 kg). CONCLUSION: Our findings outline the diverse clinical presentations of pediatric celiac disease that should be considered irrespective of age. Increased clinician's awareness will enable an early diagnosis and treatment, with subsequent symptom and nutritional status improvement.
30700359	Intestinal Spirocheteosis in a Patient with Celiac Disease. A young girl presented to us with recurrent diarrhea along with a history of 5 kg weight loss in one year. On examination, she appeared pale, while her laboratory reports showed a low hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum albumin. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was slightly raised with her iron profile suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Viral markers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology along with thyroid profile were all unremarkable. There was no history of tuberculosis, and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was also negative. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed thickening of the terminal ileum with multiple enlarged lymph nodes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) along with colonoscopy was done. Multiple biopsies were taken, which were suggestive of sprue along with intestinal spirochetosis. Her tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was negative while deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) was positive. She was kept on gluten-free diet and started on tablet metronidazole. This case shows that intestinal spirochetosis should be kept in mind in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status, who present with chronic diarrhea symptoms.
30400639	The Handbook of Minerals on a Gluten-Free Diet. The importance of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the treatment of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders is undisputable. However, strict GFD often lead to nutritional imbalances and, therefore, to deficiencies. One of the most common deficiencies from a GFD are an insufficient amount of Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn. This is mainly because the most of popular gluten-free (GF) raw materials are poor in minerals. Although the popularity of GFD is constantly growing, the data on minerals in GF products are still limited. More importantly, an access to the data is even more restricted. Therefore, the paper reviews the Ca, Fe, Mg, and Zn contents in hundreds of grain GF products available worldwide. The data for 444 products from categories of flours, mixes for cooking, bakery products, cereals, groats, rice, and pasta are obtained from research papers and nutritional databases. The calculation of the realization of mineral requirements from a portion of each product with its graphical classification as rich/average/poor source of each mineral is given. The review is a handbook of minerals for people on a GFD, dietitians, and food producers.
23077880	"[Variability of nutritional status and of the parameters of lipid metabolism in gluten-free diet]. UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months) diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of ""Sf. Maria"" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57% of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42 of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term complications."
23632357	Human leukocyte antigen genetics and clinical features of self-treated patients on a gluten-free diet. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasingly, people start a gluten-free diet (GFD) without a clear celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping is useful in ruling out CD in patients with equivocal results of serologic testing or small-bowel biopsy (SBB), but its utility and the clinical features of patients on self-treated GFD (ST-GFD) are largely unknown. METHODS: Retrospective study of single tertiary care center cohort compared 137 patients on ST-GFD and 443 patients with well-defined CD. We compared HLA genotype, symptoms, serologic and SBB results, and response to GFD between the 2 groups. Analysis used univariate logistic regression modeling, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Patients with ST-GFD presented more often with diarrhea (P<0.001), abdominal distention (P<0.001), flatulence (P=0.002), cramping (P=0.02), itchy skin (P=0.02), oral inflammation (P=0.04), and constipation (P=0.01) and less often with anemia (P<0.001) or malaise (P=0.02) than CD patients. In addition, 41% did not carry DQ2.5 and DQ8 versus 6% of CD patients (P<0.001). Only 2% of ST-GFD patients had SBB clearly consistent with CD. Family history of CD showed no difference between groups (P=0.77). Although CD patients had a statistically higher rate of GFD benefit, both groups had a high responsiveness rate (98% vs. 94%; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: HLA genotyping is useful in evaluating patients on an ST-GFD. Although confirmed CD is rare in self-treated patients, most still report benefit from GFD regardless of DQ2 and DQ8 status. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity may play a role.
37962594	"[What is established in the management of celiac disease?] Nowadays, celiac disease is well-established in internal medicine as an autoimmune disease induced by gluten as a trigger. Undoubtedly similarly well-established is the gluten-free diet. It is the only recognized therapy for celiac disease to date. However, this presents some pitfalls in its implementation, which will be discussed in the following review. In addition, current developments that have the potential to significantly change both diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are discussed. On the one hand, such an outlook was chosen since colleagues want to be ""ready"" when such developments are integrated into daily clinical routine. On the other hand, the realization that the field of mucosal immunology is moving forward has the potential to lift the spirits of the reader."
23996798	Prevalence of celiac disease in nutritional anemia at a tertiary care center. BACKGROUND: While anemia occurs in 80 % to 90 % of patients with celiac disease (CD), it may be the sole manifestation of CD. The prevalence of CD in Indian patients with nutritional anemia is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescent and adult patients presenting with nutritional anemia were prospectively screened for CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab) followed, if positive, by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients [mean +- SD age 32.1 +- 13.1 years and median duration of anemia 11 months (range 1 to 144 months)] were screened. Of these patients, 80 had iron deficiency anemia, 11 had megaloblastic anemia, and 5 had dimorphic anemia. Seventy-three patients were on hematinics and 36.4 % had received blood transfusions. Nineteen had a history of chronic diarrhea and the mean +- SD duration of diarrhea in them was 9.7 +- 35.8 months. IgA anti-tTG Ab was positive in 13 patients, of whom 12 agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Ten patients had villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3a in three, 3b in one, and 3c in six) and two did not. Thus, 10 patients with nutritional anemia (iron deficiency 9, vitamin B12 deficiency 1) were diagnosed to have CD. On multivariate logistic regression, age, duration of symptoms, and presence of diarrhea were found to be the predictors of CD. All the patients with CD were put on gluten-free diet and with iron and vitamin supplementations and showed a significant improvement in hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CD screening should be included in the work up of otherwise unexplained nutritional anemia.
29529159	Determination of gluten consumption in celiac disease patients on a gluten-free diet. Background: Celiac disease (CD) patients adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) are exposed frequently to low levels of gluten that contribute to symptoms and persistent intestinal histologic damage. Objective: We analyzed prior clinical data to determine how much gluten is accidentally consumed while on a GFD. The aim was to understand the range of gluten consumption for a wide distribution of CD patients. Design: A meta-analysis was conducted on data from 2 different clinical programs: 1) measurements of gluten in stool and urine in CD and non-CD populations; and 2) analysis of data from trials for the investigational therapeutic latiglutenase. The stool and urine studies included controlled gluten challenges. A calibration factor was applied that allowed normal ingestion of gluten to be computed from the urine and stool measurements. From the latiglutenase trial data, a determination of gluten consumption was made by estimating how much gluten was eliminated from patients' diets due to a trial effect that led to improved histology even in the placebo group. Results: The average inadvertent exposure to gluten by CD individuals on a GFD was estimated to be ~150-400 (mean) and ~100-150 (median) mg/d using the stool test and ~300-400 (mean) and ~150 (median) mg/d using the urine test. The analyses of the latiglutenase data for CD individuals with moderate to severe symptoms indicate that patients ingested significantly >200 mg/d of gluten. Conclusions: These surrogate biomarkers of gluten ingestion indicate that many individuals following a GFD regularly consume sufficient gluten to trigger symptoms and perpetuate intestinal histologic damage.
32111387	Two decades of pediatric celiac disease in a tertiary referral center: What has changed? BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common worldwide with increasing prevalence and changing presentation. AIMS: To evaluate changes in the presentation and management of CD over the last two decades. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with CD between 01.1999 to 12.2018 was performed. Comparisons were made between an early (1999 to 2008) and late (2009 to 2018) decade, regarding clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation and follow-up. RESULTS: In a cohort of 932 patients (early decade n = 316, late decade n = 616), patients from the late decade presented with lower rates of weight loss and abdominal distention (24.2% vs 34.7% and 6% vs 11%, respectively p < 0.01), and with higher rates of abdominal pain or asymptomatic presentation (41.4% vs 27.4%, p < 0.01, and 18% vs 13%, p < 0.05, respectively). Good adherence to gluten-free diet was reported more often in the late decade (64% vs 50.6%, p < 0.001), and fewer patients were lost to follow-up. During the late decade, significantly higher rates of celiac serology normalization were achieved during the first two years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: In recent years, children with CD were diagnosed with milder symptoms, showed better adherence and demonstrated earlier normalization of celiac serology.
33462461	"Gluten content in labeled and unlabeled gluten-free food products used by patients with celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free (GF) diet is the only reliable treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD), but data on the extent of gluten contamination in GF food available in India is scanty. We evaluated gluten content in labeled, imported, and non-labeled GF food products currently available in the Indian market. METHODS: Overall, 794 processed and commercially available packaged GF products (labeled GF (n = 360), imported GF (n = 80), and non-labeled/naturally GF (n = 354)) were collected from supermarkets of National Capital Region of India. Those unavailable in stores were purchased from e-commerce sites or directly from the manufacturers. Gluten level in them was determined by Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-Biopharm AG, Germany). As per Codex Alimentarius and Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, ""gluten free"" labeled products must not contain > 20 mg/kg of gluten. RESULTS: Overall, 10.1% of 794 GF products including 38 (10.8%) of 360 labeled and 42 (11.8%) of 354 non-labeled/naturally GF food products had gluten content > 20 mg/kg (range: 24.43-355 and 23.2-463.8 mg/kg, respectively). None of the imported GF products had gluten more than the recommended limits. Contaminated products most commonly belonged to cereal and their products (flours, coarse grains, pasta/macaroni, snack foods) pulse flours, spices, and bakery items. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion (10.1%) of GF food products (both labeled and non-labeled) available in India have gluten content greater than the prescribed limits of <20 mg/kg. Physicians, dietitians, support group, and patients with CeD should be made aware of this fact and regulatory bodies should ensure quality assurance."
26487487	B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism in adults celiac disease patients: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. Few studies have assessed the nutritional adequacy of this diet, especially of B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and serum concentrations of B vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism, and to determine whether the dietary intake of these vitamins are meeting Dietary Reference Intakes in celiac patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 20 celiac patients (36.3 +- 13.7 years old; 65% women), following strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. The dietary intake was assessed by 3-day food records, and serum concentrations of homocysteine and vitamins B6, B12, and folate were determined after overnight fasting. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U-test, for continuous variables. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. An alpha level of 5% were considered significant. RESULTS: Celiac patients had lower serum folate concentrations (7.7 +- 3.5 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than controls. All celiac patients had folate intake below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) (130.8 +- 53.6 mug/d). However, only a small proportion of celiac patients had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients treated with GFD presented inadequacy of dietary folate intake and low-serum concentrations of folate, suggesting that more attention should be given to the quality of the nutrients offered by the GFD, as it constitutes a lifelong treatment.
25379519	Bone mineral density at diagnosis of celiac disease and after 1 year of gluten-free diet. Atypical or silent celiac disease may go undiagnosed for many years and can frequently lead to loss of bone mineral density, with evolution to osteopenia or osteoporosis. The prevalence of the latter conditions, in case of new diagnosis of celiac disease, has been evaluated in many studies but, due to the variability of epidemiologic data and patient features, the results are contradictory. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 175 consecutive celiac patients at time of diagnosis (169 per-protocol, 23 males, 146 females; average age 38.9 years). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was repeated after 1 year of gluten-free diet in those with T-score value <-1 at diagnosis. Stratification of patients according to sex and age showed a higher prevalence of low bone mineral density in men older than 30 years and in women of all ages. A 1-year gluten-free diet led to a significant improvement in lumbar spine and femoral neck mean T-score value. We propose that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry should be performed at diagnosis of celiac disease in all women and in male aged >30 years, taking into account each risk factor in single patients. 
22984893	A gluten-free diet effectively reduces symptoms and health care consumption in a Swedish celiac disease population. BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only available treatment for celiac disease. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet on celiac disease related symptoms, health care consumption, and the risk of developing associated immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1,560 randomly selected members of the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, divided into equal-sized age- and sex strata; 1,031 (66%) responded. Self-reported symptoms, health care consumption (measured by health care visits and hospitalization days), and missed working days were reported both for the year prior to diagnosis (normal diet) and the year prior to receiving the questionnaire while undergoing treatment with a gluten-free diet. Associated immune-mediated diseases (diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatic disease, thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata and inflammatory bowel disease) were self-reported including the year of diagnosis. RESULTS: All investigated symptoms except joint pain improved after diagnosis and initiated gluten-free diet. Both health care consumption and missed working days decreased. Associated immune-mediated diseases were diagnosed equally often before and after celiac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initiated treatment with a gluten-free diet improves the situation for celiac disease patients in terms of reduced symptoms and health care consumption. An earlier celiac disease diagnosis is therefore of great importance.
27273303	[Celiac disease : Pathogenesis, clinics, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapy]. Celiac disease is induced by the consumption of gluten containing cereals (wheat, spelt, barley, rye). With a prevalence of ~ 1 %, it is the most common non-infectious chronic inflammatory intestinal disease worldwide. It manifests in all age groups, either classically with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and growth failure or weight loss, more commonly with indirect consequences of malabsorption, such as anaemia and osteoporosis, or with associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis or dermatitis herpetiformis. The pathogenesis of celiac disease is well explored. Gluten, the cereal storage protein, is not completely digested and reaches the intestinal mucosa where it activates inflammatory T cells, which cause atrophy of the resorptive villi. This T-cell activation requires a genetic predisposition (the molecules HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 on antigen-presenting immune cells). Moreover, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) which is released in the mucosa increases the immunogenicity of the gluten peptides by a deamidation reaction. The test for serum antibodies to the autoantigen TG2 is one of the best diagnostic markers in medicine, which in combination with endoscopically obtained biopsies, secures the diagnosis of celiac disease. Despite these tools celiac disease is severely underdiagnosed, with 80-90 % of those affected being undetected. The untreated condition can lead to grave complications. These include the consequences of malabsorption, cancers (especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma), and likely also the promotion of autoimmune diseases. The therapy of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet, is difficult to maintain and not always effective. Alternative, supporting pharmacological therapies are urgently needed and are currently in development. 
28153477	At-Risk Screened Children with Celiac Disease are Comparable in Disease Severity and Dietary Adherence to Those Found because of Clinical Suspicion: A Large Cohort Study. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether children at risk for celiac disease should be screened systematically by comparing their baseline and follow-up characteristics to patients detected because of clinical suspicion. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred four children with celiac disease were divided into screen-detected (n = 145) and clinically detected cohorts (n = 359). The groups were compared for clinical, serologic, and histologic characteristics and laboratory values. Follow-up data regarding adherence and response to gluten-free diet were compared. Subgroup analyses were made between asymptomatic and symptomatic screen-detected patients. RESULTS: Of screen-detected patients, 51.8% had symptoms at diagnosis, although these were milder than in clinically detected children (P < .001). Anemia (7.1% vs 22.9%, P < .001) and poor growth (15.7% vs 36.9%, P < .001) were more common, and hemoglobin (126 g/l vs 124 g/l, P = .008) and albumin (41.0 g/l vs 38.0 g/l, P = .016) were lower in clinically detected patients. There were no differences in serology or histology between the groups. Screen-detected children had better dietary adherence (91.2% vs 83.2%, P = .047). The groups showed equal clinical response (97.5% vs 96.2%, P = .766) to the gluten-free diet. In subgroup analysis among screen-detected children, asymptomatic patients were older than symptomatic (9.0  vs 5.8 years of age, P = .007), but the groups were comparable in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-half of the screen-detected patients with celiac disease had symptoms unrecognized at diagnosis. The severity of histologic damage, antibody levels, dietary adherence, and response to treatment in screen-detected cases is comparable with those detected on a clinical basis. The results support active screening for celiac disease among at-risk children.
34248079	[Celiac disease:a case report detailing clinical and pathological improvement with a gluten-free diet]. Celiac disease has a morbidity of 0.2 to 1% in Europe and the United States (US), but appears to be extremely rare in Japan with only a few case reports. This report details a Japanese woman with celiac disease diagnosed by histopathological findings and the improvement of her clinical symptoms on a gluten-free diet. The woman was in her 60s and presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting which were repeatedly exacerbated over several weeks. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital for a detailed examination and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a crude granular mucosa with an erythematous color in the duodenum. No special findings were noted on colonoscopy or capsular endoscopy. Histopathological findings of the duodenum noted villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and lymphocytic infiltration within the surface epithelium, which were suspicious for celiac disease. A gluten-free diet was started which resulted in improved clinical symptoms. Repeat endoscopic imaging and histopathological findings after initiation of the gluten-free diet demonstrated improved small bowel villous atrophy. In this case, appropriate testing had ruled out inflammatory bowel disease, amyloidosis, infectious enteritis, parasitic disease, and allergies. Although anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (ATTGA) were serologically negative, and HLA typing was HLA-DQ6, the patient was ultimately diagnosed as having celiac disease based on the characteristic pathological findings and clinical course. In many cases of celiac disease reported in Japan, serum antibodies such as AGA and ATTGA have not been detected, and HLA testing has been negative for DQ2 or DQ8. Therefore, it is possible that celiac disease in Japan might have different genetic and immunological characteristics than the disease in the US and Europe. In the future, additional cases with histology and molecular biological analysis are necessary to test this hypothesis.
36859658	Nutrient intakes in adult and pediatric coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Celiac Disease (CD) continues to require a strict lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD) to maintain healthy status. Many studies have assessed the GFD nutritional adequacy in their cohorts, but an overall picture in adults and children would offer a lifetime vision to identify actionable areas of change. We aimed at assessing the nutrient intakes of adult and pediatric CD patients following a GFD diet and identifying potential areas of improvement. Systematic review was carried out across PubMed, Scopus and Scholar up to October 2022, including full-text studies that assessed the nutrient intakes of CD patients on GFD, in terms of macro- and/or micronutrients (absolute or percentage daily average). Random-effect meta-analysis and univariable meta-regression were applied to obtain pooled estimates for proportions and influencing variables on the outcome, respectively. Thirty-eight studies with a total of 2114 patients were included. Overall, the daily energy intake was 1995 (CI 1884-2106) Kcal with 47.8% (CI 45.7-49.8%) from carbohydrates, 15.5% (CI 14.8-16.2%) from proteins, and 35.8% (CI 34.5-37.0%) from fats. Of total fats, 13.2% (CI 12.4-14.0%) were saturated fats. Teenagers had the highest consumption of fats (94.9, CI 54.8-134.9 g/day), and adults presented insufficient dietary fiber intake (18.9 g, CI 16.5-21.4 g). Calcium, magnesium, and iron intakes were particularly insufficient in adolescence, whereas vitamin D was insufficient in all age groups. In conclusion, GFD may expose CD patients to high fat and low essential micronutrient intakes. Given GFD is a lifelong therapy, to prevent the occurrence of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular or bone disorders) dietary intakes need to be assessed on long-term follow-ups.
26060114	Therapeutic approaches for celiac disease. Celiac disease is a common, lifelong autoimmune disorder for which dietary control is the only accepted form of therapy. A strict gluten-free diet is burdensome to patients and can be limited in efficacy, indicating there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to supplement or supplant dietary therapy. Many molecular events required for disease pathogenesis have been recently characterized and inspire most current and emerging drug-discovery efforts. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) confirm the importance of human leukocyte antigen genes in our pathogenic model and identify a number of new risk loci in this complex disease. Here, we review the status of both emerging and potential therapeutic strategies in the context of disease pathophysiology. We conclude with a discussion of how genes identified during GWAS and follow-up studies that enhance susceptibility may offer insight into developing novel therapies. 
21880523	
23083994	Nutrition assessment in celiac disease. The gluten-free diet is currently the only treatment for celiac disease, and patients should be monitored closely by a dietitian who is knowledgeable regarding this diet. Evaluation by a dietitian includes a comprehensive assessment of dietary history, with an emphasis on caloric and micronutrient intake. Patient knowledge of the gluten-free diet is assessed and interpretation of food labels is taught. Identification of micronutrient deficiencies or comorbid gastrointestinal conditions may occur during a comprehensive dietary assessment. In patients with evidence of gluten exposure, a thorough evaluation for cross-contamination is performed.
22277809	Bone mass in women with celiac disease: role of exercise and gluten-free diet. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac patients report fatigue and reduced social activities, which may decrease physical activity. This study investigated the physical activity, fatigue and bone mineral density in celiac women at diagnosis and during diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first group (n=48) had the bone mineral density measured at diagnosis and after 2 years of a gluten-free diet; in the second group (n=47) bone mineral density was measured at diagnosis and after 5 years of a gluten-free diet. Both groups completed a physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale for the perception of fatigue at diagnosis and follow-up. Data about smoking habits, alcohol use, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, drug therapy and body mass index were also collected. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the two groups were similar for all considered variables. At follow-up, the mean body mass index and physical activity questionnaire's score were similar to baseline. The bone density increased in both groups, whilst the physical activity questionnaire and visual analogue scale remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The improvement in bone density following a gluten-free diet was significant after 2 years; physical activity is frequently low and plays a minor role in determining the changes in bone mineral density.
29113007	[Gluten-free diet - Update 2017]. Since sixty years, the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option for patients with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetitormis to normalize symptoms and prevent complications. In recent years, the use of a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing because of presumed effects on well-being and control of body weight. GFD is becoming a popular health choice for everybody.In the present review, evidence-based indications for a gluten-free diet are stressed, the need for profound dietary counselling and education of the patient is underlined, problems and pitfalls of the implementation of a gluten-free diet in daily practice and possible side effects of long-term gluten-free diets are mentioned. New methods to control adherence to a gluten-free diet and aspects of nutritional quality of commercial gluten-free products are discussed in detail.
38674808	Intraepithelial Lymphogram in the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Adult Patients: A Validation Cohort. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a gluten-related pathology, highly prevalent and heterogeneous in its clinical presentation, which leads to delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The analysis of duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) by flow cytometry (lymphogram) is emerging as a discriminative tool in the diagnosis of various forms of celiac disease (CD). AIMS: The aim of this study was to validate IEL lymphogram performance in the largest adult series to our knowledge, in support of its use as a diagnostic tool and as a biomarker of the dynamic celiac process. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including 768 adult patients (217 with active CD, 195 on a gluten-free diet, 15 potential CD patients, and 411 non-celiac controls). The IEL subset cut-off values were established to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the lymphogram. RESULTS: A complete celiac lymphogram profile (>=14% increase in T cell receptor [TCR]gammadelta IELs and simultaneous <=4% decrease in surface-negative CD3 [sCD3-] IELs) was strongly associated with active and potential forms in over 80% of the confirmed patients with CD, whereas the remaining patients with CD had partial lymphogram profiles (>=14% increase in TCRgammadelta or <=4% decrease in sCD3- IELs), with lower diagnostic certainty. None of these patients had a non-celiac lymphogram. Quantifying the TCRgammadelta versus sCD3- imbalance as a ratio (>=5) is a discriminative index to discard or suspect CD at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the IEL lymphogram's diagnostic efficiency (79% sensitivity, 98% specificity), with an LR+ accuracy of 36.2. As expected, the increase in TCRgammadelta IELs is a reliable marker for celiac enteropathy, while changes in sCD3- IEL levels throughout the dynamic CD process are useful biomarkers of mucosal lesions.
28514243	Celiac Disease Symptom Resolution: Effectiveness of the Gluten-free Diet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal (EI) symptom resolution and identify predictors for persistence of symptoms in all celiac patients at the University of Chicago. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2002 to 2015. GI symptoms included abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, failure to thrive/weight loss, nausea, reflux, and vomiting. EI symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgia, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients (227 children) with celiac disease (CeD) were included. Abdominal pain, diarrhea and failure to thrive were the most common GI symptoms in children whereas diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain were most common in adults. Short stature, fatigue, and headache were the most common EI symptoms in children whereas iron deficiency anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children had significantly higher rates of EI and GI symptom resolution as compared to adults, with greater rates of improvements in GI versus EI symptoms at more than 24 months. Long duration of symptoms, female sex, and non-adherence to a GFD were the most important significant predictors of failure to clinically improve. CONCLUSIONS: On a strict GFD, children report greater rates of both GI and EI symptom resolution as compared to adults with greater rates of improvement in GI over EI symptoms. Early recognition of CeD and close attention to diet adherence may help in symptom resolution.
23906112	Celiac disease: a disease with varied manifestations in adults and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the characteristics of patients with celiac disease and differences between those who presented during adolescence or adulthood. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 233 consecutive patients with celiac disease who were diagnosed at 12-18 years or >18 years of age. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. RESULTS: The diagnosis of celiac disease was made after 18 years of age in 153 (65.7%) patients. Median duration of symptoms at the diagnosis was 54 months (range 1 month to 29 years). In all, 103 (44.2%) patients with atypical manifestations were referred by other departments for evaluation. Chronic diarrhea (48.5%), short stature (27.0%) and chronic anemia (9.0%) were the common modes of presentation. Elevated level of aminotransaminase were present in 50 (24.3%) patients. Chronic diarrhea, hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia were present in significantly higher number of adult than adolescent patients. In all, 227 (97.4%) patients responded to a 6-month gluten-free diet and six non-responders were non-compliant. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of the patients with celiac disease present to clinicians other than gastroenterologists or internists with atypical manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing its variant forms.
34510390	The Gluten-Free Diet and Its Relationship with Metabolic Syndrome: Dietary Friend or Foe? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent digestive illness as well as a budding area of research in the field of gastroenterology. While investigations are underway to find new and improved pharmacological therapies for CD, the gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the only option to effectively manage the condition. RECENT FINDINGS: While the GFD is recommended for patients diagnosed with CD and other gluten-related conditions, studies show the number of individuals on the GFD surpasses the projected number of patients with these medical indications (1). The implications of widespread adoption of this dietary approach are still being determined, with many patients believing this diet will improve overall health and cardiovascular risk. This review analyzes the relationship between a GFD and metabolic syndrome in both non-celiac and celiac patients, concluding that although the diet may slightly improve overall cardiac risk factors, weight, and/or insulin resistance, its use in the absence of a gluten-related disorder is controversial.
31094177	Celiac disease associated with ulcerative colitis. The article provides clinical observation of a patient who was diagnosed with celiac disease when he was 52 years (Marsh stage IIIB). Following gluten-free diet (GFD) clinical remission and restoration of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) structure occurred, however in 6 years ulcerative colitis developed and an impairment of SIM morphological structure was identified (Marsh stage IIIA). Ulcerative colitis and celiac disease remission is supported by GFD, anti-cytokine therapy (adalimumab) in combination with mesalazine.
24253051	Lectin staining shows no evidence of involvement of glycocalyx/mucous layer carbohydrate structures in development of celiac disease. The presence of unique carbohydrate structures in the glycocalyx/mucous layer of the intestine may be involved in a susceptibility to celiac disease (CD) by serving as attachment sites for bacteria. This host-microbiota interaction may influence the development of CD and possibly other diseases with autoimmune components. We examined duodenal biopsies from a total of 30 children, of which 10 had both celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D); 10 had CD alone; and 10 were suspected of having gastrointestinal disease, but had normal duodenal histology (non-CD controls). Patients with both CD and T1D were examined before and after remission following a gluten-free diet. We performed lectin histochemistry using peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) staining for Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc and Fucalpha1-2Gal-R, respectively, of the glycocalyx/mucous layer. The staining was scored based on dissemination of stained structures on a scale from 0 to 3. Evaluation of the scores revealed no difference between biopsies obtained before and after remission in the group of children with both CD and T1D. A comparison of this pre-remission group with the children who had CD alone or the non-CD controls also showed no significant differences. Based on our material, we found no indication that the presence of Gal-beta(1,3)-GalNAc or Fucalpha1-2Gal-R is involved in the susceptibility to CD, or that the disease process affects the expression of these carbohydrates. 
21621350	[Complications of celiac disease]. Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.
21601206	Combined atherogenic effects of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown a high cardiovascular risk in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Conversely, few data are available about patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to assess carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT), in patients with T1DM, CD or both (T1DM+CD) as compared with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (H). METHODS: We enrolled 120 patients, 30 with T1DM, 30 with CD, 30 with T1DM+CD and 30 H. Clinical, metabolic and anthropometric data were collected. All T1DM patients were on insulin while all CD patients were on a gluten-free diet. c-IMT was evaluated by high frequency linear digital ultrasound. RESULTS: c-IMT was significantly greater in patients with T1DM+CD than in patients with T1DM or CD (P<0.001 for both), while no difference was found between T1DM and CD. Moreover, c-IMT was greater in CD than in H (P<0.001). Glycemic control and disease duration were similar between T1DM+CD and T1DM. Lipid and anthropometric parameters were similar among groups. Furthermore, in a pooled multivariate analysis, only age and disease type were significantly correlated with c-IMT (P<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that celiac patients have greater c-IMT as compared with healthy individuals. Thus, non-invasive monitoring of c-IMT in CD might be useful in preventing cardiovascular disease. Moreover, patients with T1DM+CD show more severe subclinical atherosclerosis as compared with those presenting T1DM or CD only, suggesting that the association of these autoimmune diseases might accelerate the atherosclerotic process.

32218420	Fecal gluten immunogenic peptides as indicators of dietary compliance in celiac patients. BACKGROUND: It is important to have methods for evaluating dietary compliance in patients with celiac disease (CD). Determination of fecal gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) was recently proposed as a method of detecting gluten intake. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether determination of GIPs can be used as an indicator of compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five persons with CD on a gluten-free diet for at least one year were enrolled in the study. Compliance with the diet was assessed by the Biagi questionnaire, evaluation of symptoms and assay of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG). GIPs were determined by iVYLISA GIP-S test (Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) on an automated Chorus analyzer (DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy), after extraction of fecal samples by the method developed by DIESSE. RESULTS: Four patients tested positive for GIPs (GIP+), two of whom complied strictly with the gluten-free diet according to the Biagi questionnaire. None of the four GIP-positive patients manifested symptoms. IgA anti-tTG was significantly higher in GIP+ than in GIP- subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Assay of fecal GIPs identified more patients who were not complying with the diet than the Biagi questionnaire or evaluation of symptoms. The anti-tTG and GIP results agreed perfectly; however, since anti-tTG antibodies remain high for longer and are not a completely reliable marker of GFD intake, detection of fecal GIPs offers a direct, objective, quantitative assessment of exposure, even occasional, to gluten and could be used to check dietary compliance.
34495279	"The role of probiotics in the immune response and intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease: a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in peripheral immunological response (decrease in blood proinflammatory cytokines) and fecal microbiota (especially Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) after administration of probiotics in children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. DATA SOURCE: The databases MEDLINE, LILACS, Springer and SciELO were used for this review, with the descriptors ""celiac disease AND probiotics"". At the end of the search, 168 articles were retrieved, four of which were included in the final qualitative synthesis, having as inclusion criteria randomized clinical trials and pediatric population (1-19 years) and, as exclusion criteria, interventions other than probiotics, studies with patients with other diseases associated with celiac disease, or patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria. All elected studies were published until September 2020, without language restriction, with patients receiving strains of Bifidobacterium breve or B. longum and on a gluten-free diet. DATA SYNTHESIS: The studies show that the administration of probiotics along with a gluten-free diet, can approximate the fecal microbiota of celiac patients to typical conditions of healthy individuals, by restoring the abundance of some microbial communities that characterize the typical physiological condition. In addition, the administration of probiotics can reduce serum proinflammatory cytokines (mainly TNF-alpha). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive correlation between probiotics and fecal microbiota/serological markers in pediatric patients with celiac disease, we emphasize the need for future multicentric studies that should include a larger number of patients and a longer follow up period."
23314669	Celiac disease in a child with ulcerative colitis: a possible genetic association. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are both immune-mediated enteropathies. It is rare for both celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease to occur together in an individual patient. This association has been reported in adults, however, very rarely in children. Here, we report an unusual case of an 8-year-old child with a history of anemia and failure to thrive who presented with bloody diarrhea. His evaluation showed anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive celiac antibodies. Endoscopic evaluation revealed partial duodenal villous atrophy and pancolitis. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and UC and responded well to a gluten-free diet and steroid/mesalamine therapy. The patient's genetic testing revealed markers showing susceptibility for both celiac disease and UC. It is important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.
36235823	The Update of the Italian Food Composition Database of Gluten-Free Products and Its Application in Food-Based Dietary Guidelines Menus. Complete food composition databases (FCDBs) on gluten-free (GF) foods are needed to assess the nutrient intakes of celiac disease patients. The aim of the present work was to update the previously developed version of the Italian GF-FCDB and to apply it to a theoretical GF diet. The updated GF-FCDB includes the composition of 108 GF cereal-based foods, as sold, in terms of energy and macro- and micro-nutrients, imputed using food label information combined with the standard recipe approach. Three scenarios (i.e., refined, mixed, and wholegrain cereals) of the weekly guideline menu for the general Italian population were analyzed for energy and nutrient content in a theoretical dietary assessment using traditional gluten-containing (GC) foods and the corresponding GF substitutes. All GF menus were higher than the corresponding GC menus in polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, and vitamin E. Zinc was lower in GF than in GC menus only in the wholegrain-cereal scenario. Thanks to the application of the updated GF-FCDB including a comprehensive list of micronutrients, we observed that it is possible for celiac disease patients to meet nutrient requirements by simply substituting GC with GF cereal-based products following recommendations for the general population.
23877215	[A case of celiac disease]. Celiac disease is a chronic absorptive disorder of the small intestine caused by gluten. The prevalence rate of celiac disease is 1% in Western countries. But, it is rare in Asian countries, and there is no celiac disease reported in Korea. Here, we report a case of celiac disease. An 36-years-old woman complained non-specific abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had anemia and was taking medication for osteoporosis. Colonoscopy showed no abnormality except shallow ulcer at the terminal ileum. Gastroduodenoscopy showed micronodularity at the duodenum 2nd and 3rd portion. Capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy showed villous atrophy and blunting of villi from the duodenum. Small intestinal pathology showed villous atrophy with lymphocyte infiltration. After gluten free diet, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia and osteoporosis were improved. And, she felt well-being sensation. This is a first case of celiac disease in Korea.
35973187	Anemia Etiology and the Response to a Gluten-Free Diet in Untreated Patients With Celiac Disease: A 2-Year Follow-Up. INTRODUCTION: Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are common in newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CeD). We aim to determine the prevalence and etiology of anemia in a cohort of patients with CeD in the United States and examine the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the laboratory parameters related to anemia in CeD. METHODS: We analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of adults with biopsy-proven CeD followed in a specialized CeD center between January 2000 and June 2016. We used the level of hemoglobin (Hb) and micronutrients suggested by the World Health Organization to establish the diagnosis of anemia or deficiencies. Demographic data and laboratory parameters related to anemia and micronutrients were recorded at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD. A celiac expert nutritionist or gastroenterologist evaluated all patients. RESULTS: In 572 patients with laboratory evaluation before starting a GFD, approximately 25% presented with anemia at the time of diagnosis of CeD. Iron deficiency was present in 50.8% of the cohort and in 78.8% of the patients with anemia. Within the anemic population, 84.4% of female patients as compared with 58.3% of male patients ( P = 0.02) showed iron deficiency. Folate deficiency (23.2%), vitamin B12 deficiency (11%), and anemia of chronic diseases (7.8%) were also part of both sexes' anemia etiology. Of the initially anemic patients, 81% and 89% normalized their Hb levels within 1 year and 2 years of beginning a GFD, respectively. All patients received appropriate supplementation when needed. DISCUSSION: Approximately 25% of individuals have anemia at CeD diagnosis. The anemia etiology included iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia of chronic diseases. Most of the patients will normalize their Hb levels and the anemia laboratory parameters 1 year after starting a strict GFD.
36839352	"IgE-Dependent Allergy in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Systematic Review. In order to answer the question if an IgE-mediated allergy (A-IgE) may occur in subjects with celiac disease (CD), a systematic review was performed of available publications collected in the United States National Institute for Biotechnology Information/National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine/PubMed database up to 28 December 2022, with the use of the following keywords ""allergy&celiac/coeliac"", ""sensitization&celiac/coeliac"", and ""anaphylaxis&celiac/coeliac"" compared in the form of a conjunction. In total, the search returned 2013 publications from these keywords in any section of the article. As numerous review articles included the above-mentioned entries in the abstract, we decided to focus on the publications with the entries only in the title (n = 63). After rejecting studies unrelated to the topic, narrative reviews, book chapters, conference abstracts, symposium reports, letters to the editor, or non-English articles, 18 publications (6 observational original studies and 12 case reports describing a total of 15 cases of A-IgE developed after a diagnosis of CD) were included to this review. Our study is the first systematic review on allergy occurrence in CD patients. The analysis indicated that the possibility of a coexistence of A-IgE with any food and inhalant allergens in subjects diagnosed with CD should be considered. A sensitization to wheat was the most frequently described in subjects with CD. The clinical manifestation of A-IgE in CD was similar to that in subjects without CD; e.g., with possible atopic dermatitis, vomiting, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylactic shock. Screening for allergies in subjects with CD should be considered, especially in those cases where symptoms persist after introducing a gluten-free diet. The elimination of wheat from the diet of patients with CD may lead to a loss of immune tolerance and to the development of sensitization, which may even manifest as anaphylaxis. In conclusion, although there are few studies assessing the occurrence of A-IgE in subjects with CD, they show the possibility of a coexistence of both diseases and the high clinical significance of this phenomenon, which indicates the need for further studies."
36033766	"Current knowledge and ""myths"" about celiac disease among physicians in the Republic of Kazakhstan: A countrywide cross-sectional study. Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a common genetically predisposed autoimmune condition affecting the gut and other organs. Disease awareness is one of the key components of early case identification. This study aimed to assess awareness about CD among primary care physicians, who are the front-liners in suspecting the diagnosis, and other medical specialists. Methods and findings: The questionnaire for this survey-based study was created based on the latest international guidelines on CD and included a consent form, 5 general questions (age, gender, etc.), and 10 specific questions concerning CD. Overall, 232 respondents from 13 country provinces (out of 14) and two republican cities were recruited for this study. Of them, 110 (47.4%) were primary care physicians and 122 (52.6%) other medical specialists, including 10 (4.3%) gastroenterologists. A scoring system was used to classify the level of awareness of participants into 3 categories, namely, poor, fair, and good. Analysis of responses revealed poor awareness in 59.4% of physicians, associated with work in republican/province/district/rural/village hospitals (p = 0.004), male gender (p = 0.006), and age of 40-50 years (p = 0.02). The most common ""myths"" about CD were the following: ""symptoms are always obvious in children"" or ""in adults"" (92.5 or 88.4% of respondents, respectively); ""genetic mutation HLA DQ2/DQ8 causes the development of CD in all carriers of the mutation"" (51.3%); ""CD is a disease of children only"" (12.5%); and ""is triggered by dairy products"" (8.6%). Genotyping of HLA DQ genes has been recommended in case of CD suspicion by every third respondent and was advocated as a ""golden standard"" confirmatory test by every fifth respondent. A quarter of respondents revealed their incorrect treatment strategies: gluten-free diet for 1 month, dairy-free diet, Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, or responded that did not know how to treat. Overall, 93.5% of respondents expressed intention to learn more about CD, while the rest 6.5% thought that they knew enough, although their knowledge was poor. Conclusion: This study revealed a poor level of awareness among physicians in Kazakhstan and identified common misconceptions about CD, which potentially could lead to incorrect application of diagnostic tests, delay in diagnosis, and inefficient treatment. Development and implementation of educational programs as well as promotion of self-learning would increase awareness and unravel misconceptions."
34464324	Bone Mineral Density Screening and the Frequency of Osteopenia/Osteoporosis in Turkish Adult Patients With Celiac Disease. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in adult patients with celiac disease (CD) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with CD were retrospectively screened through follow-up records and computer databases. Patients assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at diagnosis and/or in the follow-up after a GFD were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred patients who underwent a DEXA scan at least once after diagnosis or after being on a GFD were included in the study. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 34.61 +- 10.3 years, and 84% of the patients (n = 84) were female. At the time of diagnosis (n = 46), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 67.3% and 15.2%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 43.4% and 10.8%, respectively, at the femur. After a GFD (n = 78), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 61.5% and 8.9%, respectively, at the lumbar spine, and 37.1% and 2.5%, respectively, at the femur. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) is high after diagnosis and in the follow-up after a GFD. It is important for all patients with CD to undergo a DEXA scan to determine the follow-up and/or treatment characteristics.

21189704	Intractable seizures and metabolic bone disease secondary to celiac disease. Celiac disease (CD) is Gluten sensitive enteropathy with a wide spectrum of severity and protean clinical manifestations. Patients with atypical (non-diarrhoeal) presentations are missed as the diagnosis of Celiac Disease is not considered. We present three young girls (ages 18, 19, 23 at presentation) who were admitted to our hospital as intractable seizures. All had low serum calcium, features of rickets/osteomalacia and anaemia. This prompted us to consider malabsorption due to CD. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by serologic tests (IgA transglutaminase and IgG antigliadin antibodies) and biopsy of the duodenum. In all patients gluten free diet not only provided drug free control of seizures but also helped correct other features of malabsorption like hypocalcaemia and anaemia as the primary pathology behind these symptoms was corrected. We wish to highlight that hypocalcaemia of CD which may present as intractable seizures can be treated only by treating CD with gluten free diet and not by oral vitamin D and Calcium alone.
27908520	Diagnosis and Updates in Celiac Disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It can result in intraintestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of disease including diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, or lymphoma. Diagnosis of celiac disease is made through initial serologic testing and then confirmed by histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsies. Generally celiac disease is a benign disorder with a good prognosis in those who adhere to a gluten-free diet. However, in refractory disease, complications may develop that warrant additional testing with more advanced radiologic and endoscopic methods. This article reviews the current strategy to diagnose celiac disease and the newer modalities to assess for associated complications.
26186878	Celiac disease in children. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since the use of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies in the early 1990s, two main groups of clinical presentation can be identified: patients with a symptomatic form of the disease, and patients with a pauci (a)-symptomatic form detected during the work-up of another autoimmune disease or due to a family history of celiac disease. The prevalence of both forms of the disease is currently estimated between 1/100 and 1/400. Classical form of the disease is characterized by occurrence of diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and abdominal bloating in young infants in the months following gluten introduction. Serological tests show high level of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies. Until recently, the diagnosis required duodenal biopsies that show villous atrophy. HLA genotype can help for diagnosis: the absence of the HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 alleles has a high negative predictive value. European guidelines recently proposed to reconsider the need for systematic endoscopy in typical symptomatic forms with high level of anti-transglutaminase and positive anti-endomysium. These recommendations are being assessed now. Currently, the gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Children with celiac disease have to exclude from their diet all products containing wheat, barley and rye. Gluten-free diet causes clinical remission within a few weeks, but normalization of the small bowel mucosa and negativity of anti-transglutaminase antibodies are obtained in several months or even years. Gluten-free diet is useful to obtain clinical assessment, but also to prevent long-term complications of celiac disease, mainly osteoporosis, other autoimmune diseases, decreased fertility and cancers.
29057833	Indications and Use of the Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet for Patients with Non-Responsive Celiac Disease. For the majority of patients diagnosed with celiac disease, once a gluten-free diet is initiated, symptoms improve within weeks and may completely resolve in months. However, up to 30% of patients may show signs, symptoms or persistent small intestinal damage after one year on a gluten-free diet. These patients require evaluation for other common GI etiologies and assessment of their celiac disease status in order to make a diagnosis and suggest treatment. Here, we propose an approach to evaluating patients with celiac disease with persistent symptoms, persistently elevated serology, and or persistent villous atrophy despite a gluten-free diet. We detail how to diagnose and distinguish between non-responsive and refractory celiac disease. Finally, we introduce the indications for use of the gluten contamination elimination diet and provide information for practitioners to implement the diet when necessary in their practice.
32097370	Severity of Villous Atrophy at Diagnosis in Childhood Does Not Predict Long-term Outcomes in Celiac Disease. OBJECTIVES: Current pediatric guidelines allow noninvasive diagnosis of celiac disease in selected children. We investigated in a large cohort study whether the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with clinical characteristics or long-term health outcomes, thus having a prognostic significance. METHODS: Comprehensive medical data on 906 children with celiac disease were analyzed. Long-term health outcomes of 503 adult patients diagnosed in childhood were moreover assessed with a specific study questionnaire and validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the severity of villous atrophy at diagnosis, and all variables were compared. RESULTS: Altogether 34% of the patients had partial, 40% subtotal, and 26% total villous atrophy. Children with milder lesions were diagnosed more recently (median year 2007 vs 2006 vs 2001, respectively, P < 0.001), more often by screening (30% vs 25% vs 17%, P < 0.001) and they suffered less often from anemia (16% vs 21% vs 32%, P < 0.001) and growth disturbances (22% vs 36% vs 54%, P < 0.001) and had lower transglutaminase-2 antibody levels (median 64 U/L vs 120 U/L vs 120 U/L, P < 0.001). There was no difference in other disease features.Altogether 212 adults diagnosed in childhood completed the questionnaires. Severity of villous atrophy at childhood diagnosis did not predict presence of complications or comorbidities, persistent symptoms, and self-perceived health, quality of life or adherence to a gluten-free diet in adulthood. CONCLUSION: Presence of advanced villous atrophy at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics but not with poorer long-term health and treatment outcomes.
30367395	All that a physician should know about gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only definitive treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD). Strict adherence to GFD improves the symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, and the overall well-being of the patients. The management of CeD is truly different and unique from the treatment of other medical or surgical diseases. While prescribing a GFD is easy, the key to the success lies in the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist/physician and maintenance of adherence to the prescribed diet by the patient. When restricting gluten from all possible sources, it is pertinent to recommend a diet that is healthy and balanced for patients with celiac disease. Those following GFD must be counseled properly on the ways of balancing their diets and of avoiding cross contamination. They should be taught how to read food labels properly and given tips for dining out or during traveling. Regular follow up with patients is required for assessing the compliance and monitoring growth and the status of recovery. In this review article, we have compiled, for the physicians and gastroenterologists, the relevant information about GFD including counseling, adherence, nutritional adequacy, and many other related issues.
23383526	Diagnosis of celiac disease during pre-operative work-up for bariatric surgery. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Morbid obesity is a highly prevalent condition. In selected cases, bariatric surgery is indicated. Although for decades celiac disease (CD) has been associated with chronic diarrhea and weight loss, now it becomes clear that the clinical spectrum is extremely wide. METHODS: We report 5 morbidly obese patients that were diagnosed of CD during preoperative work-up for bariatric surgery. Diagnosis was suspected during routine upper endoscopy, and confirmed by histology and positive CD-specific serology. RESULT: Four of the 5 cases were asymptomatic. One complained of chronic diarrhea and anemia. All cases initiated a gluten-free diet. Due to CD, patients were offered a purely restrictive bariatric procedure. Three patients underwent a sleeve gastrectomy while the other two are still undergoing pre-operative evaluations. CONCLUSION: This report enlarges the clinical spectrum of untreated CD. Although prevalence of CD in obese patients seems to be similar to that in the general population, morbid obese patients should be tested for CD in order to establish the best surgical strategy and outcome.
31000461	Metabolic effects in patients with celiac disease, patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity, and asymptomatic controls, after six months of a gluten-free diet. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: It is essential for patients with celiac disease (CD) to be on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but said diet has also been reported to increase the risk for metabolic syndrome. There is no evidence on the metabolic effects of a GFD in patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or in asymptomatic subjects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of a GFD over a 6-month period in patients with CD, patients with NCGS, and in asymptomatic controls (ACs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted that evaluated metabolic syndrome and its components of obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia at the baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 66 subjects (22 CD, 22 NCGS, and 22 AC) were included in the study. At the baseline, 10% of the patients with CD presented with obesity, high blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome. After 6 months, obesity and metabolic syndrome increased by 20% (p=0.125). In the patients with NCGS, obesity increased by 5% after the GFD and 20% of those patients presented with de novo hepatic steatosis. The prevalence of obesity decreased by 10% in the controls after the GFD (30 vs 20%, p=0.5) and none of the other components of metabolic syndrome were affected. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic benefits and risks of a GFD should be considered when prescribing said diet in the different populations that opt for that type of intervention.
31915797	Short children with impaired growth hormone secretion. Do they have celiac disease? OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of celiac disease (CeD) in children with short stature (SS) and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with isolated SS and GHD, diagnosed during the period 2002 to 2016. Their medical records were reviewed and serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody results retrieved. Patients with positive serology results underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of CeD. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 351 patients identified with GHD, 199 (56.7%) were male. The mean age+-SD was 9.0+-3.7 years (range: 2-17.6 years), and the mean+-SD height-for-age z score was -2.9+-1.3. Partial GHD constituted 42.2% and severe GHD constituted 57.8% of GHD diagnoses. The mean growth hormone (GH) peak level was 5.8+-3.9 ng/ml. Forty-seven patients (13.4%) had positive serology, and 14 (4%) had biopsy-proven CeD. No predictors could be identified through binary logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: A prevalence of CeD seropositivity was found in 13.4% and overt CeD in 4% of children with GHD. The finding of GHD should not preclude the search for CeD, because the majority will potentially improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD).
29258815	Elevated serum antiphospholipid antibodies in adults with celiac disease. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased incidence of thrombosis is suggested in celiac disease. We explored serum levels of antiphospholipid antibodies in untreated and treated adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: A cohort of 179 biopsy-proven celiac disease patients (89 untreated, 90 on long-term gluten-free diet) and 91 non-celiac controls underwent clinical examination, assessment of celiac serology and enzyme immunoassay testing for anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, prothrombin IgG, and phosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG and IgM. RESULTS: The level of antiphospholipid antibodies was higher in celiac disease patients compared with controls: anticardiolipin IgG 4.9 (0.7-33.8) vs 2.2 (0.4-9.6) U/ml, antiprothrombin IgG 2.9 (0.3-87.8) vs 2.1 (0.5-187.0) U/ml, antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG 6.9 (0.0-54.1) vs 2.3 (0.5-15.1) U/ml; p < 0.05 for all. Anticardiolipin IgG, antiprothrombin IgG and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG were higher in treated compared with untreated patients. The phenotype of celiac disease at presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption or anemia, and extraintestinal symptoms or screen-detected disease) had no effect on the level of serum antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSION: The serum level of antiphospholipid antibodies is increased in adults with celiac disease. The higher level of antibodies in treated patients suggests that the increase is not gluten-dependent. The prothrombotic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in celiac disease warrants further studies.
21157327	Advances in celiac disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically summarize recent research in celiac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: There are new serological markers with potential use not only in the diagnosis of celiac disease but also as important follow-up tools. As our understanding of celiac disease increases with further isolation of nonhuman leukocyte antigen genes and clarification of the intracellular pathways that underlie its pathogenesis, there are new modalities which will not only allow improved risk stratification of individuals but also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic agents. SUMMARY: Small bowel biopsy remains the gold standard for both diagnosis and monitoring. A gluten-free diet currently remains the only treatment option, with potential other options being discovered such as glutenases for predigestion of gluten.

30287732	Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet in Children with Celiac Disease. Celiac disease (CD) can only be treated by rigorous life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). The study included 102 mothers and their CD children treated with GFD for at least two years. Frequency and cause of diet failure in children treated at present (54 children) and 10 years ago (48 children) were compared. Dietary adherence was evaluated serologically (tTG), while diet management difficulties were examined by means of a questionnaire. The study shows that one-third of patients fail to follow GFD, more often 10 years ago than now (40% vs. 26%; p < 0.05), mainly children aged 13-18 (54% vs. 40% now; p < 0.05). Younger children (up to 12) are less likely to abandon the diet (27% vs. 8%; p < 0.05). In this age group non-intentional diet failure prevails, while teenagers interrupt their diet intentionally (45% vs. 33%; p = ns (small population of children in this groups)). Currently, the most common causes of teenage diet failure are the absence of symptoms after consuming a small amount of gluten and, even more often, troublesome diet administration. Previously, the absence of peer acceptance prevailed. With this study we found that: 1. In West Pomerania, every fourth CD child does not follow GFD. 2. For years, teenagers have failed to follow GFD due to the absence of symptoms after consuming small amounts of gluten. 3. The incidence of non-intentional failure to follow GFD has significantly decreased over years, which indicates better dietary care.
27480555	[An analysis of clinical features of celiac disease patients in different ethnic]. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of different racial patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze the disease prevalence, diagnosis and treatment in Chinese population. METHODS: All the patients were diagnosed as CD and enrolled in Beijing United Family Hospital between January 2005 and July 2015.Clinical data including nationality, age, symptoms, endoscopic and pathological findings, outcome were collected and compared in patients from different countries. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were enrolled including 63 Caucasians, 18 Asian patients and 6 Middle East patients.The peak age of disease onset was 40-60 years old.Patients with typical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss only accounted for 20.7%(18/87) and 9.2%(8/87) respectively.Some patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating [32.2%(28/87)], even constipation [5.7%(5/87)].13.8%(12/87) patients were previously diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.The incidence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation between Asians and Caucasians had no statistical significance (P>0.05); but the proportions of weight loss, growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian group were significantly higher than that in Caucasian group (P<0.05). IgA type of anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) were dominant autoimmune antibodies in patients with CD, which accounted for 58.6%(51/87), 44.8%(39/87) and 36.8%(32/87) respectively.The endoscopy showed that the lesion of CD was mainly located in small intestine, with reducing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine.The lesions of duodenal bulb and descending duodenum appeared more significant in Asian group.Accordingly pathological intestinal atrophy and the degree of intraepithelial lymphocytosis were more severe in Asian patients.All 87 cases took the gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighty-one cases received serological follow up and 8 with endoscopic intestinal biopsy.The celiac disease antibodies in 47 patients turned negative from 6-9 months after GFD treatment, while 34 patients turned negative from 12-18 months after GFD.All patients reported disease remission to some extent.After 1 year GFD treatment, the pathology of endoscopic intestinal biopsy in 8 patients showed significant improvement of villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with typical clinical manifestations are not the majority.Serological celiac disease antibodies (AGA, EMA and tTGA) have a high diagnostic value.GFD treatment is effective on majority of celiac patients.Clinical manifestations, endoscopy, intestinal pathology, and response to GFD in Chinese patients are not the same as Caucasians.Clinicians need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis.
30513876	Are Gluten-Free Diets More Nutritious? An Evaluation of Self-Selected and Recommended Gluten-Free and Gluten-Containing Dietary Patterns. Gluten-free (GF) eating patterns are frequently perceived to be healthier than gluten-containing (GC) ones, but there has been very little research to evaluate this viewpoint. The effect of GF eating patterns on dietary composition was assessed using two independent approaches. One approach compared macronutrients and typical shortfall nutrients between MyPlate example menus developed with either GC or equivalent GF foods. In this analysis, the GF menus were significantly lower in protein, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E, folate, and sodium (p = 0.002-0.03), with suggestive trends towards lower calcium and higher fat (p = 0.06-0.08). The second approach was a meta-analysis of seven studies comparing information on the nutrient intakes of adults with celiac disease following a GF diet with control subjects eating a GC diet, and differences were evaluated using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed rank tests. In this analysis, consuming a GF diet was associated with higher energy and fat intakes, and lower fiber and folate intakes compared to controls (p < 0.001 to p = 0.03). After adjusting for heterogeneity and accounting for the large mean effect size (-0.88 +- 0.09), the lower fiber remained significant (p < 0.001). These combined analyses indicate that GF diets are not nutritionally superior except for sodium, and in several respects are actually worse.
32686439	A comparison of the nutritional profile and price of gluten-free products and their gluten-containing counterparts available in the Spanish market. INTRODUCTION: Background: to date, gluten-free (GF) diet is the only treatment available for individuals with celiac disease. Both individual and collective food intake assessments are a challenge because a food composition database of GF products (GFPs) is lacking. Objectives: to describe the process of developing a food composition database of GFPs, and to compare the nutritional profile and price of some GFPs and non-GFPs. Methods: initially, a total of 216 brands of GFPs marketed in Spain were recorded. Nutritional information was collected from nutritional labels and product fact sheets that had been provided by food companies or collected first-hand by researchers. Then, the nutritional profile and price of the cereal and cereal byproducts foodstuff groups, including 19 types of products, were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical program (22.0 edition; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results: a total of 2,247 GFPs from 126 different foodstuff brands were included in the food composition database of GFPs (CELIAC-BASE). We classified these products into 14 foodstuff groups. The protein content of the GFPs studied was significantly lower, and the price was higher, than that of their non-GFP counterparts. Some, but not all, GFPs had a higher content of fat and sugar, and a lower content of dietary fiber as compared to their non-GFP counterparts. Some GFPs were up to 6 times more expensive than the corresponding non-GFPs. Conclusions: CELIAC-BASE is a pioneering tool for dietitians. Many GFPs have poor nutritional profiles and should be consumed only occasionally in a balanced GF diet.
24445753	Health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with celiac disease: patient-driven data from focus group interviews. PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease requiring constant management with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about how CD impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents, and how they feel about and cope with CD and GFD. This qualitative study explores the impact of CD and GFD on HRQOL in everyday living of children and adolescents. METHODS: In focus group interviews, we investigated HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD in order to identify patient concerns in living with CD and on a GFD. Seven focus groups were formed with 23 children/adolescents and 3 parents. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory approach was applied to analyse the interviews. RESULTS: CD had varying impact on the children and adolescents HRQOL. Two major categories emerged with importance for HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD, having CD (constructed from the six subcategories: symptoms, the diagnosis-process, self-perception, awareness of CD, social and emotional impact of CD, and thoughts about the future) and coping with CD (constructed from the two subcategories: coping with food and coping with social situations). The complexity of coping with CD in social situations that involve food is presented in a flowchart. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents showed large diversity in how much impact CD has on their HRQOL. Different ways of coping with CD and GFD were identified. Findings will be used to generate a patient-driven disease-specific questionnaire to measure HRQOL in children and adolescents with CD.
26606684	Adverse Effects of Wheat Gluten. Man began to consume cereals approximately 10,000 years ago when hunter-gatherers settled in the fertile golden crescent in the Middle East. Gluten has been an integral part of the Western type of diet ever since, and wheat consumption is also common in the Middle East, parts of India and China as well as Australia and Africa. In fact, the food supply in the world heavily depends on the availability of cereal-based food products, with wheat being one of the largest crops in the world. Part of this is due to the unique properties of wheat gluten, which has a high nutritional value and is crucial for the preparation of high-quality dough. In the last 10 years, however, wheat and gluten have received much negative attention. Many believe that it is inherently bad for our health and try to avoid consumption of gluten-containing cereals; a gluten-low lifestyle so to speak. This is fueled by a series of popular publications like Wheat Belly; Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health. However, in reality, there is only one condition where gluten is definitively the culprit: celiac disease (CD), affecting approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. Here, I describe the complexity of the cereals from which gluten is derived, the special properties of gluten which make it so widely used in the food industry, the basis for its toxicity in CD patients and the potential for the development of safe gluten and alternatives to the gluten-free diet. 
30453686	Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease-Forever and for All? The gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment available for celiac disease. However, it is difficult to adhere to and a closer look on the diet's implementation and indications reveals several ambiguities: Not only is there controversy on the threshold of gluten that can be tolerated in the frame of a strict gluten-free diet, but it is also unclear whether the gluten-free diet is an appropriate treatment in patient subgroups with asymptomatic or potential celiac disease. Reports from a number of research groups suggest that a certain proportion of patients may effectively develop tolerance to gluten and thus become suitable for gluten reintroduction over time. In this review, we set out to create an overview about the current state of research as regards the definition of a strict gluten-free diet in terms of the gluten thresholds considered tolerable and the indication for a gluten-free diet in the absence of histological abnormalities or symptoms. Furthermore, we discuss the concept that a gluten-free diet must be followed for life by all patients.

23253610	Long-term follow-up after gene therapy for canavan disease. Canavan disease is a hereditary leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA), leading to loss of enzyme activity and increased concentrations of the substrate N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the brain. Accumulation of NAA results in spongiform degeneration of white matter and severe impairment of psychomotor development. The goal of this prospective cohort study was to assess long-term safety and preliminary efficacy measures after gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the ASPA gene (AAV2-ASPA). Using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and standardized clinical rating scales, we observed Canavan disease in 28 patients, with a subset of 13 patients being treated with AAV2-ASPA. Each patient received 9 x 10(11) vector genomes via intraparenchymal delivery at six brain infusion sites. Safety data collected over a minimum 5-year follow-up period showed a lack of long-term adverse events related to the AAV2 vector. Posttreatment effects were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, which showed changes in predefined surrogate markers of disease progression and clinical assessment subscores. AAV2-ASPA gene therapy resulted in a decrease in elevated NAA in the brain and slowed progression of brain atrophy, with some improvement in seizure frequency and with stabilization of overall clinical status.
16568890	Adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector: vector development, production and clinical applications. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as an attractive vector for gene therapy. AAV vectors have successfully been utilized to promote sustained gene expression in a variety of tissues such as muscle, eye, brain, liver, and lung. As the significance of AAV as a gene therapy vector has been realized over the past years, recent developments in recombinant AAV (rAAV) production and purification have revolutionized the AAV field. It is now possible to produce high yields of vector (10(12)-10(13) genome-containing particles per mL) that are free of contaminating cellular and helper virus proteins. Such vectors have been successfully used in preclinical applications in animal models such as those of hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases and vision deficiency, all of which have shown therapeutic benefits from rAAV treatment. Clinical trials using rAAV2 for the treatment of hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and Canavan disease have begun, and reports from these phase I trials support the safety seen in preclinical trials. Eventually, tissue-specific vectors that can potentially evade the immune system will be required to optimize success in gene therapy. In recent years, this has led to the development of retargeted rAAV2 vectors and the identification and characterization of new serotypes from human and nonhuman primates that could potentially achieve these goals. AAV virologists and gene therapists alike have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of the utility of this small virus in a clinical setting. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in rAAV vector production and purification, vector development, and clinical applications.
19685155	Glyceryl triacetate for Canavan disease: a low-dose trial in infants and evaluation of a higher dose for toxicity in the tremor rat model. Canavan disease (CD) is a fatal dysmyelinating genetic disorder associated with aspartoacylase deficiency, resulting in decreased brain acetate levels and reduced myelin lipid synthesis in the developing brain. Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor, glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8 and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months, starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250 mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily, initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.
11589315	Canavan disease: a review of recent developments. The clinical features, causes and potential treatment of Canavan disease are reviewed. The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.
16532510	Immune responses to AAV in a phase I study for Canavan disease. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.
12443821	Upper airway abnormalities in Canavan disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe upper airway anatomical abnormalities associated with Canavan disease. METHODS: Retrospective case report. RESULTS: Physical examination and laryngoscopy demonstrated oropharyngeal narrowing, macroglossia, and bronchial asymmetry in a child with Canavan disease. Tracheostomy decreased problems with chronic aspiration and obstructive sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal obstruction and bronchial asymmetry are previously undescribed upper airway abnormalities found in an individual with Canavan disease. Tracheostomy is an effective method of managing chronic aspiration and obstruction in these patients.
28748022	[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou]. Congenital lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial spaces. Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing incomplete penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy disease examined for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of large congenital member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right leg painful to palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical assessment objectified cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive of ectasia of the right saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities, despite the small chromosomal rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy, bandages, compression stockings and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso testifies to the rarity of the pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties related to the inadequacy of paraclinical investigations.
27816481	NK cell effector functions in a Chediak-Higashi patient undergoing cord blood transplantation: Effects of in vitro treatment with IL-2. NK cell cytotoxicity in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is strongly impaired as lytic granules are not released upon NK-target cell contact, contributing to several defects typical of this severe immunodeficiency. Correction of NK cell defects in CHS should improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, proposed as therapy. We investigated NK cell functions in a CHS patient before and after cord-blood transplantation, and the ability of in vitro IL-2 treatment to restore them. Before the transplant, the strong defect in NK cell-mediated natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, as well as in IFN-gamma production, could be restored up to normal levels by in vitro IL-2 treatment. This cytokine also caused the appearance of smaller lysosomal granules and their orientation towards the NK-target cell contact area, thus suggesting that IL-2 had a more general capacity to restore NK cell effector functions. Moreover after the transplant, although the successful engraftment, NK cell cytotoxicity resulted still partially impaired at one year, almost normal at ten years and, anyhow, fully recovered by in vitro IL-2 treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that IL-2 had a wide capacity to restore NK cell effector functions, being able to reverse the altered cytotoxic activity, lytic granule pattern, and cytokine production observed in the CHS patient.
15765164	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Taiwanese children with primary immunodeficiency. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since 1968 it has been known that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can ameliorate primary immunodeficiencies, but data on the long-term efficacy of this treatment in Taiwan are limited. This study analyzed the outcome of HSCT and the immune reconstruction in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of HSCT in 10 children with primary immunodeficiencies between 1986 and 2002. The primary immunodeficiencies in these children included severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 4, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) in 4, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) in 1, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) in 1. The conditioning protocols included busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 2 patients with SCID, 3 patients with WAS, 1 patient with LAD and 1 patient with CHS. Anti-thymocyte globulin was given to only 1 patient with WAS and no conditioning therapy was given in 2 SCID patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate was prescribed in 6 children, CsA alone in 1, and CsA and T-cell depletion in 1. RESULTS: Six patients were cured and 1 improved during a follow-up period from 3.5 years to 13 years after transplantation. Three patients died of severe sepsis. Three patients developed acute GVHD, which was grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1. Veno-occlusive disease developed in 1 patient and chronic GVHD with contracture of joints in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the benefits of allo-HSCT in children with primary immunodeficiencies. However, HSCT should be performed as soon as possible before severe infection develops.
33093354	Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant With Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide for Chediak-Higashi Syndrome: A Very Rare Case Report. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency disorder for which hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment option. HSCT only corrects the hematologic and immunologic manifestations of the disease but neurologic complications may still progress after transplant. Haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) has evolved as a feasible alternative for patients with primary immunodeficiency. More recently, there has been use of haplo-HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. However, only 4 cases of Chediak-Higashi syndrome have been reported using this approach. Here, the authors describe a case of a 17-month-old boy who was successfully treated by haplo-HSCT with reduced-toxicity conditioning (fludarabine/treosulfan/melphalan) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide.
28355352	A novel frameshift mutation of Chediak-Higashi syndrome and treatment in the accelerated phase. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disease characterized by frequent infections, hypopigmentation, progressive neurologic deterioration and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), known as the accelerated phase. There is little experience in the accelerated phase of CHS treatment worldwide. Here, we present a case of a 9-month-old boy with continuous high fever, hypopigmentation of the skin, enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly and lung infection. He was diagnosed with CHS by gene sequencing, and had entered the accelerated phase. After 8 weeks of therapy, the boy had remission and was prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.

28219570	Living-Donor Lung Transplantation After Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chediak-Higashi Syndrome. An 8-year-old girl with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) had pulmonary complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and eventually underwent single living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT). Electron micrographic findings showed vagus nerve tissue in extracted lung having granular inclusions, which are pathognomonic for CHS. Because her mother was the donor for both hematopoietic stem cell and lung transplantations, she was weaned from immunosuppression and is doing well 3 years after lung transplantation. Furthermore, an induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell line was established from her skin fibroblasts for investigation and potential future treatment for CHS.
28762620	A case of Chediak-Higashi syndrome presented with accelerated phase could be treated effectively by unrelated cord blood transplantation. CHS is a rare immunodeficiency syndrome with defects in the functions of cytotoxic cells and neutrophils. Approximately 85% of patients with CHS undergo an AP within the first decade, which is similar to FHLH. Chemotherapy could induce transient remission, but only allogeneic HCT could correct the underlying genetic defect and prevent relapse. We reported a case of CHS diagnosed at 19 months, who had an elder brother who had previously succumbed to the same disease. The little girl presented with severe AP manifestations including recurrent high fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and extraordinary hepatosplenomegaly occupying the whole abdominal and pelvic cavity. Comprehensive therapies including HLH 2004 protocol, supportive care, and antibiotics, especially antituberculous agents, were given to her to induce remission. After remission, the patient received fully HLA-matched UCBT. The transplantation course was uneventful, except for fluctuation of donor chimerism. The patient has been alive for 36 months without infection and neurologic manifestations and is under further follow-up. Our result provides another case that UCBT can be effective for treating patients with CHS and remission before HCT is important for good prognosis.
17293882	Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. We reviewed outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 35 children with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). Twenty-two patients had a history of the life-threatening accelerated phase of CHS before HCT and 11 were in accelerated phase at transplantation. Thirteen patients received their allograft from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, 10 from an alternative related donor and 12 from an unrelated donor. Eleven recipients of HLA-matched sibling donor, three recipients of alternative related donor and eight recipients of unrelated donor HCT are alive. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 5-year probability of overall survival is 62%. Mortality was highest in those with accelerated phase disease at transplantation and after alternative related donor HCT. Only four of 11 patients with active disease at transplantation are alive. Seven recipients of alternative related donor HCT had active disease at transplantation and this may have influenced the poor outcome in this group. Although numbers are limited, HCT appears to be effective therapy for correcting and preventing hematologic and immunologic complications of CHS, and an unrelated donor may be a suitable alternative for patients without an HLA-matched sibling. Early referral and transplantation in remission after accelerated phase disease may improve disease-free survival.
14599068	Chediak-Higashi syndrome: four cases from Northern Finland. UNLABELLED: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare multiorgan disease entity with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency, recurrent bacterial infections and various neurological symptoms. Intracellular vesicle formation is deficient, resulting in giant granules in many cells, e.g. giant melanosomes in the melanocytes. Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.
14528111	Fludarabine and once-daily intravenous busulfan for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. An HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant was done for a patient with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The preparative regimen included intravenous fludarabine (40 mg/m2/dx4) and busulfan (130 mg/m2/dx4). Busulfan was given once daily. Pharmacokinetic studies showed the area under the concentration-time curve of the once-daily intravenous busulfan was similar to that seen with the total daily dose administered with an every-6-hourly regimen. Toxicity was minimal. Myeloid engraftment occurred on day +17 and donor chimerism was complete. Fludarabine and once-daily intravenous busulfan is well tolerated and is adequate for engraftment of sibling transplant in Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
26511512	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The clinical outcome of allogeneic HSCT was retrospectively analyzed in eight patients with CHS. In total, six of these eight patients are alive. Four of five patients transplanted with MAC achieved prompt engraftment, and three of the four patients, including two patients with AP before transplant, are alive without disease. In contrast, three patients transplanted with RIC without active AP disease achieved prompt engraftment and survive long term. RIC-HSCT might be an alternative treatment for CHS similar to other types of HLH, at least for patients without active AP disease. 
11509933	Failure of sustained engraftment after non-myeloablative conditioning with low-dose TBI and T cell-reduced allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation. We investigated whether a T cell-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) with minimal conditioning and subsequent donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) could reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD while retaining stable engraftment. Five patients with hematological malignancies (three MM, one CLL, one Chediak-Higashi syndrome) were conditioned with TBI (200 cGy). One patient additionally received fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)). CsA and mofetyl-mycophenolate (MMF) were administered to prevent GVHD. All patients were grafted with >3 x 10(6)/kg highly purified CD34(+) cells together with 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3(+) cells (three patients) or 1 x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells (two patients). Quick hematopoietic recovery and initial mixed donor chimerism was observed. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal in all but one patient who died of treatment-refractory GVHD on day 112. The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment. Predominant donor T cell chimerism is not a prerequisite for initial allogeneic hematopoietic proliferation. However for sustained long-term engraftment it is of major importance.
15790783	Progressive neurologic dysfunctions 20 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Three patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation between the ages of 2 years 9 months and 7 years. The outcome was uneventful, with sustained mixed chimerism. No subsequent recurrent infections or hemophagocytic syndrome were observed. At the age of 22 to 24 years, these 3 patients developed a neurologic deficit combining difficulty walking, loss of balance, and tremor. Neurologic evaluation demonstrated cerebellar ataxia and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Moderate axon loss and rarefaction of large myelinated fibers were observed on semithin sections of peripheral nerve. Cerebellar atrophy was detected by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in 2 patients. We also reviewed the very long-term outcome of the other 11 patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome who had received bone marrow transplants at our center since 1981. All displayed neurologic deficits or low cognitive abilities.
30778805	Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Primary Immune Deficiency Disorders in Children: Challenges and Outcome from a Tertiary Care Center in South India. Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo SCT) has emerged as an acceptable alternative to matched family donor transplantation for children diagnosed to have primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDs). We present data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16-21 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of grade 2-3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5% with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this curative procedure among children with PIDs.
16190108	Chediak-Higashi syndrome: a case report. A 5-month-old Chinese male infant was referred to the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur for persistent fever, generalised rash and abdominal distension. Clinically he was suspected to have haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Haematological findings including the presence of several abnormal giant granules in neutrophils and single large azurophilic granules in many lymphocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood established the diagnosis of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The patient responded to allogeneic bone marrow transplant. This paper discusses the characteristic features, clinical course and management of this rare disorder. We suggest that peripheral blood film examination for the abnormal giant granules in granulocytes is an essential investigation in all young children with frequent recurrent infections or who are suspected to have virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome or familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
33451859	High protein prescription in methylmalonic and propionic acidemia patients and its negative association with long-term outcome. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are inborn errors of metabolism. While survival of MMA and PA patients has improved in recent decades, long-term outcome is still unsatisfactory. A protein restricted diet is the mainstay for treatment. Additional amino acid mixtures (AAM) can be prescribed if natural protein is insufficient. It is unknown if dietary treatment can have an impact on outcome. DESIGN: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study and evaluated both longitudinal dietary treatment and clinical course of Dutch MMA and PA patients. Protein prescription was compared to the recommended daily allowances (RDA); the safe level of protein intake as provided by the World Health Organization. The association of longitudinal dietary treatment with long-term outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: The cohort included 76 patients with a median retrospective follow-up period of 15 years (min-max: 0-48 years) and a total of 1063 patient years on a protein restricted diet. Natural protein prescription exceeded the RDA in 37% (470/1287) of all prescriptions and due to AAM prescription, the total protein prescription exceeded RDA in 84% (1070/1277). Higher protein prescriptions were associated with adverse outcomes in severely affected patients. In PA early onset patients a higher natural protein prescription was associated with more frequent AMD. In MMA vitamin B12 unresponsive patients, both a higher total protein prescription and AAM protein prescription were associated with more mitochondrial complications. A higher AAM protein prescription was associated with an increased frequency of cognitive impairment in the entire. CONCLUSION: Protein intake in excess of recommendations is frequent and is associated with poor outcome.
31757659	Liver transplantation in propionic and methylmalonic acidemia: A single center study with literature review. BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.
31715057	Liver Transplantation in Children With Propionic Acidemia: Medium-Term Outcomes. Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) is an emerging therapeutic option. We present a retrospective review of patients with PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of 14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of 3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1 graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The 2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and 69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis), 225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years). LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.

25683683	Early and late complications after liver transplantation for propionic acidemia in children: a two centers study. Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe metabolic disorder with cardiac and neurologic complications and a poor quality of life. Liver transplantation (LT) was thus proposed in PA to increase enzyme activity. We studied retrospectively LT in PA in two European centers. Twelve patients underwent 17 LTs between 1991 and 2013. They developed severe, unusual and unexpected complications, with high mortality (58%). When present, the cardiomyopathy resolved and no acute metabolic decompensation occurred allowing dietary relaxation. Renal failure was present in half of the patients before LT and worsened in all of them. We suggest that cardiac and renal functions should be assessed before LT and monitored closely afterward. A renal sparing immunosuppression should be used. We speculate that some complications may be related to accumulated toxicity of the disease and that earlier LT could prevent some of these consequences. As kidney transplantation has been performed successfully in methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disease in the same biochemical pathway, the choice of the organ to transplant could be further discussed.
28298669	Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Continuous Renal Replacement in a Neonate with Propionic Acidemia. The usual indications for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are for respiratory or cardiac failure. Although continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is frequently used when patients are on ECMO, the need for CRRT as the primary indication for ECMO is rare. A case of a neonate placed onto veno-venous ECMO for the use of CRRT to treat hyperammonemia from propionic acidemia is presented.
31915802	Peripheral venous route for administration of ammonul infusion for treatment of acute hyperammonemia. An experience from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the local effects of peripheral Ammonul infusion on the skin and the subcutaneous tissues.  Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All children less than 16 years of age admitted between December 2015 and October 2018 with hyperammonemia and received Ammonul infusion for treatment were recruited. Results: Twenty-one patients received the Ammonul infusion. They were admitted 58 times with acute hyperammonemia during the study period, with an average of 2.8 admissions per patient. The mean age of the included patients was 49.5 months. The most frequent underlying diagnoses were propionic acidemia (n=9), urea cycle disorders (n=5), and intrinsic liver disease (n=3). All participants received Ammonul through peripheral lines except 3 who received it through central lines. No extravasation, burns, or other local side effects were observed in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This data indicate that the use of Ammonul through a peripheral venous route appears to be safe and not associated with infusion-related local adverse effects.

36710110	Combined heart and liver transplantation in a patient supported by left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with propionic acidemia. Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to inborn errors of metabolism. PA results in the accumulation of abnormal organic acid metabolites in multiple systems, mainly the central nervous system and the heart. Cardiac complications include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and carry a 40-50% increased mortality risk. Liver transplantation (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant. PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to prevent and treat metabolic decompensation. The patient had a successful heart and liver transplant after a strict treatment protocol in the pre, intra, and post-operative periods. His case highlights the complexity of PA patients and the increased risk for metabolic decompensation during surgery and provides an insight into how to manage such complicated patients.
30080956	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia and Methylmalonic Acidemia: Perioperative Management and Clinical Outcomes. Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) comprise the most common organic acidemias and account for profound morbidity in affected individuals. Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.

35189944	Therapeutic potential of living donor liver transplantation from heterozygous carrier donors in children with propionic acidemia. BACKGROUND: Current world experience regarding living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) is limited, especially in terms of using obligate heterozygous carriers as donors. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years; range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.
33093405	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: Evidence From a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The worldwide experience of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) remains limited and fragmented. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.
32270363	Post-transplantation Outcomes in Patients with PA or MMA: A Review of the Literature. INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) and those with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.
35401508	Immunological Memory and Affinity Maturation After Vaccination in Patients With Propionic Acidemia. Earlier studies have recommended routine childhood immunization in patients with propionic acidemia (PA); however, the literature presents insufficient data on the response to vaccines, notably specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation, after measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and diphtheria/tetanus (DiphtTe) vaccinations in this population. In patients with PA, cellular and humoral changes of the immune system (e.g. a decreased CD4+ T cell count, with a reversal of CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, a deficient gamma-globulin fraction, and in one case a decreased lymphocyte blastogenesis) have been reported. Former reports also detected pancytopenias accompanying febrile infections in PA patients. In the current study, we analyzed vaccine-specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation after MMR and DiphtTe vaccinations in 10 patients with PA. Compared to gender and age matched controls, all 10 had protective IgG concentrations for at least one tested antigen, and in 6 out of 10 patients high relative avidity indices for measles and rubella were detected. In summary, the present study revealed a sufficient immune response and outcome, indicating an acceptable humoral memory in patients with PA after booster vaccinations.
29679984	Long-term continuous N-carbamylglutamate treatment in frequently decompensated propionic acidemia: a case report. BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder that can inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, the obligatory activator in urea synthesis, leading to hyperammonemia. N-carbamylglutamate ameliorates hyperammonemia in decompensated propionic acidemia. The effects of long-term continuous N-acetylglutamate administration in such patients are unknown. We report our clinical experience with continuous administration of N-acetylglutamate for 6 years in a patient with propionic acidemia frequently presenting with hyperammonemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient with frequently decompensated propionic acidemia and hyperammonemia was admitted 78 times for acute attacks during the first 9 years of his life. Continuous daily treatment with oral N-carbamylglutamate 100 mg/kg (50 mg/kg after 6 months) was initiated. During 6 years of treatment, he had a significant decrease in his mean plasma ammonia levels (75.7 mumol/L vs. 140.3 mumol/L before N-carbamylglutamate therapy, p < 0.005 [normal range 50-80 mumol/L]) and fewer acute episodes (two in 6 years). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit of N-acetylglutamate administration outside the emergency setting. If this observation is confirmed, future studies should aim to optimize the dosage and explore effects of the dosage requirements on other drugs and on protein tolerance.
27283461	Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis Via Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Pump for Treatment of Hyperammonemia Secondary to Propionic Acidemia in Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Boys. Late-preterm twins with propionic acidemia developed severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy at 5 days of age. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was performed successfully for both infants via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump, and both rapidly improved. They were taken off continuous venovenous hemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged with dietary therapy. At 3 years of age, neurodevelopment showed globally delayed milestones.
31978012	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: A Multicenter-linked Database Analysis. OBJECTIVES: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, some odd chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on liver transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA. METHODS: Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers. RESULTS: The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5-year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher postoperative rate of readmission compared with the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs 72.8%, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.
25990417	Cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation in methylmalonic and propionic acidemias. Propionic acidemia (PA) and classical methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare inborn errors of metabolism that can cause early mortality and significant morbidity. The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical MMA or PA.
30242960	The Role of Liver Transplantation in Propionic Acidemia. Despite optimal medical treatment and strict low-protein diet, the prognosis of propionic acidemia (PA) patients is generally poor. We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.
33978500	Anesthetic Management for Pediatric Liver Transplantation in a Patient With Propionic Acidemia: A Case Report. Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of propionic acid due to deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Main stay of treatment focuses on reducing dietary protein. However, orthotropic liver transplantation decreases the frequency of metabolic decompensations and improves life expectancy. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy undergoing orthotropic liver transplantation to treat propionic acidemia. This case highlights the use of intraoperative monitoring of metabolic markers like urine ketones, arterial ammonia, and lactate levels as these patients are at risk for hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis. Also, the relevance in outcomes when performing early extubation in fast-tracking recovery.
31196016	Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of the use of carglumic acid in patients with propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. INTRODUCTION: Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism characterized by hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) dysfunction. Carglumic acid (Carbaglu ; Orphan Europe Ltd.) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of hyperammonemia due hepatic NAGS deficiency. Here we report the rationale and design of a phase IIIb trial that is aimed at determining the long-term efficacy and safety of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group phase IIIb study will be conducted in Saudi Arabia. Patients with PA or MMA (<=15 years of age) will be randomized 1:1 to receive twice daily carglumic acid (50 mg/kg/day) plus standard therapy (protein-restricted diet, L-carnitine, and metronidazole) or standard therapy alone for a 2-year treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of emergency room visits due to hyperammonemia. Safety will be assessed throughout the study and during the 1 month follow-up period after the study. DISCUSSION: Current guidelines recommend conservative medical treatment as the main strategy for the management of PA and MMA. Although retrospective studies have suggested that long-term carglumic acid may be beneficial in the management of PA and MMA, current literature lacks evidence for this indication. This clinical trial will determine the long-term safety and efficacy of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: King Abdullah International Medical Research Center ( KAIMRC ): (RC13/116) 09/1/2014. Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) (33066) 08/14/2014. ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02426775) 04/22/2015.
38084006	Prophylactic Intramedullary Rodding After Femoral Lengthening in Patients With Achondroplasia and Hypochondroplasia. BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-a retrospective comparative study.
20226364	Improving mobility in a client with hypochondroplasia (dwarfism): a case report. A client with hypochondroplasia dwarfism and a medical diagnosis of spinal stenosis had found that her ability to walk had decreased over the past 7 years from easily walking 6 miles (10 K) to now needing to rest every half block (171 ft/52 m) due to muscle fatigue. Such weakness is consistent with nerve impingement due to spinal stenosis, which would not be improved by massage. However, during a preliminary assessment, it was found that both lower legs had severe fascial adhesions, possibly compressing lower leg blood vessels and nerves. It was hoped that by using myofascial massage techniques to relieve the adhesions, her mobility would improve over the course of 8 sessions. Myofascial massage techniques showed positive results in reducing adhesions, improving circulation, and increasing the distance the client could walk before resting to 2 blocks (686 ft/209 m).

9539301	Effect of growth hormone therapy in children with achondroplasia: growth pattern, hypothalamic-pituitary function, and genotype. OBJECTIVE: Although there are a few reports on GH therapy in achondroplasia, these were based on a small sample and/or short-term observation. To clarify the effectiveness of GH treatment on short stature in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia, a long-term treatment study in a larger number of patients was performed. METHOD: Forty-two children (16 males and 26 females, age 3-14 years) with achondroplasia were examined in this study. Initially, we evaluated hypothalamic-pituitary function and point mutation analysis as previously reported. After the evaluation, the children were treated with GH for more than 2 years; then post-treatment growth velocity and body proportion parameters were determined. RESULTS: The 35 typical variants of our achondroplasia patients showed previously reported point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The annual height gain during GH therapy was significantly greater than that before therapy (3.9 +/- 1.0 cm/year before treatment vs 6.5 +/- 1.8 cm/year for the first year and 4.6 +/- 1.6 cm/year for the second year of treatment). The body disproportion had not been aggravated during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: We conclude that GH might be beneficial in the treatment of short stature in children with achondroplasia in the first 2 years of treatment.
22137367	A pilot study of discontinuous, insulin-like growth factor 1-dosing growth hormone treatment in young children with FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the growth promoting effect of a recombinant growth hormone (rGH) treatment protocol adjusted on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) dosing in children affected by the most severe forms of FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia. STUDY DESIGN: Midterm results of an open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, 2003-2020 pilot trial to final stature, including 6 children (mean age, 2.6 +- 0.7 years; mean height SDS, -3.0 +- 0.5) with the N540K mutation of FGFR3 gene who received an rGH dosage titrated to an IGF-1 level close to 1.5 SDS of the normal range. rGH therapy was interrupted 1 day per week, 1 month per year, and 6 months every 2 years. RESULTS: The mean height SDS increased by 1.9 during the 6.1 +- 0.9-year study period, reaching -0.8 to -1.3 at age 8.7 +- 1 years. The mean+-SDS baseline IGF-1 value was -1.6 +- 0.5 before rGH treatment and 1.4+-0.3 during the last year of observation. The average cumulative rGH dose was 0.075 +- 0.018 mg/kg/day (range, 0.059-0.100 mg/kg/day). Trunk/leg disproportion was improved. CONCLUSION: IGF-1-dosing rGH treatment durably improves growth and reduces body disproportion in children with severe forms of hypochondroplasia.
1785332	Growth-promoting effect of human growth hormone on patients with achondroplasia. To evaluate the effect of human growth hormone (hGH) on the growth of children with achondroplasia, three patients with achondroplasia and one patient with hypochondroplasia were treated with 0.5 IU/kg/W of pituitary-extracted hGH for 6-12 months. Mean height velocity was significantly increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm/year (P less than 0.05) by hGH. The tibial index, defined as the length/width ratio of left tibia, did not change during the treatment, indicating that hGH promotes growth without exaggeration of tubular bone deformity. Case 2, who had atlantoaxial dislocation, developed sleep apnea and neurological deficits during the second hGH treatment, but these were cured by operation. Thus, hGH therapy is effective in promoting growth in patients with achondroplasia, but the complication of atlantoaxial dislocation should be explored and corrected before the treatment.
25323764	Efficacy and safety of growth hormone treatment in children with hypochondroplasia: comparison with an historical cohort. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature. The aims of the study are to evaluate efficacy and safety of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) therapy in HCH children, when compared with a historical cohort of untreated HCH children. METHODS: Nineteen HCH patients with an initial height standard deviation score (SDS) <=-2 and a mean age of 9.3 +- 3.1 years were treated with a mean r-hGH dose of 0.053 mg/kg/day over 3 years. Growth charts were derived from the historical cohort (n = 40). RESULTS: Height gain in the treated population was +0.62 +- 0.81 SDS greater than in the general population, and +1.39 +- 0.9 SDS greater than in the historical untreated HCH cohort (mean gain of 7.4 +- 6.6 cm gain). A negative correlation between height gain and age at treatment initiation was reported (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in response between patients with fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutations and those without. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: r-hGH treatment is well tolerated and effective in improving growth in HCH patients, particularly when started early. The treatment effect varies greatly and must be evaluated for each patient during treatment to determine the value of continued therapy.
27343792	Marfan Syndrome: new diagnostic criteria, same anesthesia care? Case report and review. BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity. CASE REPORT: 61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph revealed Cobb angle of 70 . Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical prosthesis with no deficits. DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia.
31836196	Irbesartan in Marfan syndrome (AIMS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Irbesartan, a long acting selective angiotensin-1 receptor inhibitor, in Marfan syndrome might reduce aortic dilatation, which is associated with dissection and rupture. We aimed to determine the effects of irbesartan on the rate of aortic dilatation in children and adults with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: We did a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial at 22 centres in the UK. Individuals aged 6-40 years with clinically confirmed Marfan syndrome were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were all given 75 mg open label irbesartan once daily, then randomly assigned to 150 mg of irbesartan (increased to 300 mg as tolerated) or matching placebo. Aortic diameter was measured by echocardiography at baseline and then annually. All images were analysed by a core laboratory blinded to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the rate of aortic root dilatation. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN90011794. FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2012, and May 1, 2015, 192 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to irbesartan (n=104) or placebo (n=88), and all were followed for up to 5 years. Median age at recruitment was 18 years (IQR 12-28), 99 (52%) were female, mean blood pressure was 110/65 mm Hg (SDs 16 and 12), and 108 (56%) were taking beta blockers. Mean baseline aortic root diameter was 34 4 mm in the irbesartan group (SD 5 8) and placebo group (5 5). The mean rate of aortic root dilatation was 0 53 mm per year (95% CI 0 39 to 0 67) in the irbesartan group compared with 0 74 mm per year (0 60 to 0 89) in the placebo group, with a difference in means of -0 22 mm per year (-0 41 to -0 02, p=0 030). The rate of change in aortic Z score was also reduced by irbesartan (difference in means -0 10 per year, 95% CI -0 19 to -0 01, p=0 035). Irbesartan was well tolerated with no observed differences in rates of serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Irbesartan is associated with a reduction in the rate of aortic dilatation in children and young adults with Marfan syndrome and could reduce the incidence of aortic complications.

32423364	Trends of vascular surgery procedures in Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represent two connective tissue vascular diseases requiring unique consideration in their vascular surgical care. A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS: The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p < 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p < 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair (p < 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls (0.7%), p < 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%) than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p < 0.0001, while repair of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p < 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p < 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 13.0%, p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p < 0.0001), and diabetes (controls 20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p < 0.0001). Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5% and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p < 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls (22.2%), p < 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally, length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p < 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032 and controls $26,520, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.
25935877	Marfan Sartan: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. AIMS: To evaluate the benefit of adding Losartan to baseline therapy in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS AND RESULTS: A double-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, add on trial comparing Losartan (50 mg when <50 kg, 100 mg otherwise) vs. placebo in patients with MFS according to Ghent criteria, age >10 years old, and receiving standard therapy. 303 patients, mean age 29.9 years old, were randomized. The two groups were similar at baseline, 86% receiving beta-blocker therapy. The median follow-up was 3.5 years. The evolution of aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva was not modified by the adjunction of Losartan, with a mean increase in aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva of 0.44 mm/year (s.e. = 0.07) (-0.043 z/year, s.e. = 0.04) in patients receiving Losartan and 0.51 mm/year (s.e. = 0.06) (-0.01 z/year, s.e. = 0.03) in those receiving placebo (P = 0.36 for the comparison on slopes in millimeter per year and P = 0.69 for the comparison on slopes on z-scores). Patients receiving Losartan had a slight but significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the study (5 mmHg). During the study period, aortic surgery was performed in 28 patients (15 Losartan, 13 placebo), death occurred in 3 patients [0 Losartan, 3 placebo, sudden death (1) suicide (1) oesophagus cancer (1)]. CONCLUSION: Losartan was able to decrease blood pressure in patients with MFS but not to limit aortic dilatation during a 3-year period in patients >10 years old. beta-Blocker therapy alone should therefore remain the standard first line therapy in these patients.
25216402	Pelvic pain from a giant presacral Tarlov cyst successfully obliterated using aneurysm clips in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Patients with Marfan syndrome used to succumb early in life from cardiovascular complications. With the current rapid advance in medical and surgical care, such patients may now have near-normal longevities. Consequently, rare late-life complications are emerging in these patients and represent challenges to clinicians for their diagnoses and treatments. The authors report a rare case of pelvic pain and genital prolapse from a giant presacral Tarlov cyst in a 67-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome. This 67-year-old Caucasian female presented with progressively severe pelvic pain, intermittent explosive diarrhea, and dysuria. Physical and bimanual examination demonstrated genital prolapse and a nontender, cyst-like mass fixed in the midline. She underwent ultrasound, CT, and eventually MRI evaluations that led to the diagnosis of a giant (6.7 x 6.4 x 6.6 cm) Tarlov cyst originating from the right S-2 nerve root sleeve/sacral foramen with intrapelvic extension. She underwent S1-S2 and S2-S3 laminectomy with obliteration of the Tarlov cyst using aneurysm clips. Postoperatively, her pelvic pain and bowel symptoms resolved and the bladder symptoms improved. The 3-month follow-up CT of abdomen/pelvis demonstrated resolution of the cyst. The present case illustrates that clinicians caring for elderly patients with Marfan syndrome need to increasingly recognize such unusual late-life complications. Also, these large Tarlov cysts can be simply and effectively obliterated with aneurysm clips. 
28327138	Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in patients with Marfan syndrome. BACKGROUND: There is no study concerning safety and accuracy of pedicle screw placement in Marfan syndrome. The objective of this study is to investigate accuracy and safety of pedicle screw placement in scoliosis associated with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: CT scanning was performed to analyze accuracy of pedicle screw placement. Pedicle perforations were classified as medial, lateral or anterior and categorized to four grades: <= 2 mm as Grade 1, 2.1-4.0 mm as Grade 2, 4.1-6.0 mm as Grade 3, >=6.1 mm as Grade 4. Fully contained screws or with medial wall perforation <= 2 mm or with lateral wall perforation <= 6 mm and without injury of visceral organs were considered acceptable, otherwise were unacceptable. RESULTS: 976 pedicle screws were placed, 713 screws (73.1%) were fully contained within the cortical boundaries of the pedicle. 924 (94.7%) screws were considered as acceptable, and 52 (5.3%) as unacceptable. The perforation rate was higher using free-hand technique than O-arm navigation technique (30.8% VS. 11.4%, P < 0.05), higher in lumbar region than in thoracic region (34.1% VS. 22.3%, P < 0.05) and higher in concave side than in convex side (33.5% VS. 21.9%, P < 0.05). No injury of visceral organs especially aorta erosion was noted in the series. 7 cases of dural tear caused by misplaced screws occurred, and 4 cases developed cerebro-spinal fluid leak. Drainage and pressure dressings were applied for these patients, and no infection was observed. Leg pain was observed in 7 cases, and 2 cases simultaneously complained of leg weakness. Revision surgery was conducted to remove the misplaced screws for these 2 patients. Conservative treatment was applied for the 5 patients without leg weakness. Symptoms of leg weakness and pain resolved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Placement of pedicle screw in Marfan syndrome is accuracy and safe. O-arm navigation was an effective modality to ensure the safety and accuracy of screw placement. Special attention should be paid when screws were placed at the lumber spine and the concave side of spine deformity to avoid the higher rate of complications.
30207113	Long-Term Results after Modified Bentall Operation in 200 Patients. BACKGROUND: Composite graft replacement of the aortic root is the treatment of choice for an array of aortic root pathologies, such as annuloaortic ectasia, Marfan syndrome and acute or chronic aortic dissection type A. In this retrospective study of the authors' aortic surgery database, an exploration was made of factors related to early and long-term morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent this procedure. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, a total of 200 consecutive patients (male:female ratio 4:1; mean age 56.2 +- 11.66 years) underwent the modified Bentall operation at the authors' institution, with a composite graft (mechanical valve) being used to correct aortic root pathology. All preoperative, perioperative and postoperative data, as well as long-term follow up data, were retrieved from the authors' aortic surgery database. RESULTS: Preoperative characteristics of the patients included elective and emergency operations (83.1% and 15.9%, respectively). Intraoperative and 30-day mortalities were 2% and 3.5%, respectively, while the rate of postoperative cerebrovascular events was 1.5%. Long-term survival at a mean follow up of 110 months for the elective and emergency groups was 88.6% and 71.9%, respectively (p = 0.007). Moreover, during the same period new cerebrovascular events were observed in 5.8% of cases. Predictive factors for late survival were type of surgery (elective versus emergency; p = 0.023), conduit size (<=23 mm versus >23 mm; p = 0.053) , age >65 years (p = 0.001), intensive care unit stay (days; p <0.001) and postoperative creatinine level (p = 0.002). Survival rates at one, three, five and 10 years postoperatively were 93.5%, 92.5%, 91.5% and 85.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent the modified Bentall operation presented with minimal major adverse effects and demonstrated a good long-term survival.

38728516	Acute ischemic stroke with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome: A report of 3 cases in multifaceted settings. RATIONALE: Marfan syndrome (MFS), which is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disease resulting from a mutation in the FBN1 gene, exhibits variable manifestations affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and pulmonary systems. Notably, neurologic deficiency, which involves ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, is a rare but severe manifestation. The safety of rt-PA treatment for ischemic stroke caused by MFS is still under discussion. PATIENT CONCERNS: In the current report, we discuss 3 atypical MFS cases presented as acute ischemic stroke, compared to those exhibiting cardiovascular and musculoskeletal abnormalities. DIAGNOSES: Three patients were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke accompanied by MFS based on clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and genetic testings. INTERVENTIONS: The first case underwent intravenous thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, the second case received antiplatelet therapy, and the third case received anticoagulant therapy and perfusion therapy. OUTCOMES: The neurologic deficiency of all three patients showed improvement upon discharge, and there were no symptoms of recurrence observed during the follow-up period. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: MFS is a rare etiology in young people with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Physicians should take MFS into consideration when they observe the characteristic symptoms during a consultation. The potential pathogenesis of ischemic stroke secondary to MFS may include cardio-embolism, arterial dissection, and hypoperfusion. Although intravenous thrombolysis is a promising therapy to treat acute ischemic stroke, further examinations should be conducted to rule out contraindications in patients with a suspicion of MFS.
30287287	Aortic Surgery Outcomes of Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Patients at Teaching and Nonteaching Hospitals. BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in prevention and management, aortic aneurysm repair remains a high-risk operation for patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The goal of this study was to examine differences in characteristics and outcomes of patients with MFS or EDS undergoing aortic aneurysm repair at teaching versus nonteaching hospitals. METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample to study patients with MFS or EDS undergoing open or endovascular aortic aneurysm repair from 2000 to 2014. RESULTS: Of 3487 patients (MFS = 3375, EDS = 112), 2974 (85%) had repair at a teaching hospital. Patients who underwent repair at a teaching hospital were slightly younger than those who underwent repair at a nonteaching hospital (38 vs. 43 years, P < 0.01) but otherwise were similar in gender (29% vs. 28% female), race (70% vs. 78% white), and connective tissue disorder diagnosis (97% vs. 97% MFS, all P >= 0.1). There were no differences in anatomy (17% vs. 19% abdominal, 67% vs. 66% thoracic, and 15% vs. 15% thoracoabdominal, all P >= 0.1) or type of repair (5% vs. 5% endovascular), but patients at nonteaching hospitals were more likely to have a dissection (49% vs. 38%, P = 0.02). There was no difference in perioperative mortality (4% vs. 6%, P = 0.5) or length of stay (median 8 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.3) between teaching and nonteaching hospitals. There was also no difference in hemorrhagic (47% vs. 43%), pulmonary (9% vs. 16%), renal (12% vs. 14%), or neurologic (5% vs. 6%) complications between teaching and nonteaching hospitals, respectively (all P >= 0.05). In analysis stratified by anatomic extent of repair, there was a lower prevalence of pulmonary complications in thoracic aorta repairs at teaching hospitals (8.1% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.01) but a higher prevalence of hemorrhage in abdominal aortic repairs at teaching hospitals (45.6% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.04) as compared with nonteaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MFS and EDS who undergo aortic aneurysm repair have their operations predominantly at teaching hospitals, but those patients who undergo repair at nonteaching hospitals do not have worse mortality or morbidity despite a higher incidence of dissection.
27898546	Lateral Position for Cesarean Delivery Because of Severe Aortocaval Compression in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome: A Case Report. Prompt recognition and management of hypotension resulting from aortocaval compression syndrome are essential to optimize the maternal and fetal outcomes. Management involves increasing leftward uterine displacement and sometimes full lateral positioning, although lateral position during cesarean delivery is typically considered to be impractical. We report an obstetric patient case of severe aortocaval compression syndrome resulting in hypotension and loss of consciousness that ultimately underwent cesarean delivery under general anesthesia in the lateral position. Performing cesarean delivery in the lateral position is virtually unreported, and this unique strategy prevented further symptoms of aortocaval compression and enabled safe delivery.

28838101	Valve-sparing David I procedure in acute aortic type A dissection: a 20-year experience with more than 100 patients. OBJECTIVES: The aortic valve-sparing David procedure has been applied to the elective treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms with excellent results. The use of this technique in patients with acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is still a matter of debate. We present our long-term experience with 109 patients with AADA who had the valve-sparing David I procedure. METHODS: Between July 1993 and October 2015, 109 patients with AADA had the valve-sparing David I procedure at our centre. We conducted a retrospective review with follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age was 54 +- 12 years; 78 (72%) patients were men. Marfan syndrome was present in 6 (5%) patients and bicuspid aortic valve in 3 (3%). Only 4 (4%) patients received the isolated David procedure; 50 (46%) underwent additional proximal, 13 (12%) subtotal and 42 (39%) total aortic arch replacement. The in-hospital mortality rate was 11% ( n  = 12). Intraoperative/discharge echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency <= I  in 93 of 97 patients (96%). Mean follow-up time was 8.3 +- 5.7 years. The survival rate after discharge at 1, 5 and 10 years was 94%, 90% and 78%, respectively. Thirteen percent ( n  = 13) of patients underwent valve-related reoperation. Freedom from valve-related reoperation at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 88% and 85%, respectively. Compared to patients who underwent the David I procedure for any reason other than AADA, there were no significant differences in long-term survival rates ( P  = 0.29) and freedom from a valve-related reoperation ( P  = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: The valve-sparing David I procedure has acceptable long-term results even in emergent operations for AADA and is not inferior when performed in elective settings.

32650901	Meta-analysis Examining the Usefulness of Angiotensin Receptor blockers for the Prevention of Aortic Root Dilation in Patients With the Marfan Syndrome. The Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients are highly predisposed to thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection, with virtually every patient having evidence of aortic disease at some point during their lifetime. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in slowing down the progression of aortic dilatation in MFS patients. PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were searched for relevant articles published from inception to February 1, 2020. We included randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of ARBs on aortic root size in patients with MFS with a follow-up period of at least 2.5 years. Seven studies were included with a total of 1,510 patients. Our analysis demonstrated a significantly smaller change in aortic root and ascending aorta dilation in the ARBs treated group when compared with placebo (mean difference 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.31 to -0.04; p = 0.04, I2 = 94%, and mean difference -0.13, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.09; p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, respectively). ARBs as an add-on therapy to beta-blockers resulted in a significantly smaller change in aortic root dilation when compared with the arm without ARBs (mean difference -2.06, 95% CI -2.54 to -1.58; p < 0.00001, I2 = 91%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of clinical events (aortic complications/surgery) observed in the ARBs arm when compared with placebo (Risk ratio of 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.38; p = 0.94, I2 = 0%). In conclusion, ARBs therapy is associated with a slower progression of aortic root dilation when compared with placebo and as an addition to beta-blocker therapy.
31478365	Chylous Ascites Developing after Open Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome. Chylous ascites is the pathologic accumulation of chylous fluid in the peritoneal cavity, caused by lymphomas, metastatic malignancies, and abdominal surgeries, rarely due to surgical trauma of the cisterna chyli or its major branches. A 24-year-old man with history of Marfan syndrome presented to our hospital with abdominal distention, abdominal pain, fluid in the incision region, and weakness. He had underwent an elective open aneurysm repair surgery nine days before for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Computed tomography revealed massive fluid collection in the abdominal cavity, which was drained surgically. He was diagnosed with chylous ascites and was discharged after conservative treatment.
27825688	"Aortic Dissection in Pregnancy: Management Strategy and Outcomes. BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection in pregnancy is a rare but lethal catastrophe. Clinical experiences are limited. We report our experience in 25 patients focusing on etiology, management strategies, and outcomes. METHODS: Between June 1998 and February 2015, we treated 25 pregnant women (mean age, 31.6 +- 4.7 years) in whom aortic dissection developed at a mean of 28 +- 10 gestational weeks (GWs). Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) was present in 20 (80%) and type B (TBAD) in 5 (20%). Marfan syndrome was seen in 17 (68%). Management strategy was based on dissection type and GWs. RESULTS: TAADs were managed surgically in 19 (95.0%) and medically in 1 (5.0%). Maternal and fetal mortalities were, respectively, 14.3% (1 of 7) and 0 (0 of 7) in the ""delivery first"" group (7 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 33.3% (2 of 6) in ""single-stage delivery and aortic repair"" group (6 of 20), 16.7% (1 of 6) and 66.7% (4 of 6) in ""aortic repair first"" group (6 of 20), and 100% (1 of 1) and 100% (1 of 1) in the ""medical management"" group (1 of 20). TBADs were managed surgically in 60% (3 of 5) and endovascularly and medically in 20% each (1 of 5). No maternal deaths occurred. Fetal mortality was 100% in the surgical group and 0% in the other groups. During late follow-up, which was complete in 95.2% (20 of 21), 3 maternal and 2 fetal deaths occurred in the TAAD group. Overall maternal survival was 68.6% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Marfan syndrome predominates among women with aortic dissection in pregnancy. For TAADs, after 28 GWs, delivery followed by surgical repair can achieve maternal and fetal survival adequately; before 28 GWs, maternal survival should be prioritized given the high risk of fetal death. For TBADs in pregnancy, nonsurgical management is preferred."
29934004	Stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome: Midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to assess the midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome with complicated acute type B aortic dissection treated with stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination. METHODS: We reviewed all patients treated with stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome according to the revised Ghent criteria. RESULTS: Between 2015 and November 2017, 7 patients with Marfan syndrome underwent stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection. The median age of patients was 47 years (range, 23-70). Four patients had a history of aortic root replacement. Technical success was achieved in 100%. Three patients required an adjunctive procedure for renal artery stenting (n = 2) and iliac artery stenting (n = 1). There was no in-hospital death, 30-day postoperative stroke, spinal cord ischemia, ischemic colitis, or renal failure requiring dialysis. At a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 7-28), 1 patient required aortic arch replacement for aneurysmal degeneration associated with a type Ia endoleak at 2 years, giving a late reintervention rate of 14%. There was no other secondary endoleak. The primary visceral patency rate was 100%. There were no all-cause deaths reported. At last computed tomography scan, all patients had complete aortic remodeling of the treated thoracoabdominal aorta. Distally, at the nonstented infrarenal aortoiliac level, 6 patients had persistent false lumen flow with stable aorto-iliac diameter in 5. One patient had iliac diameter growth (27 mm diameter at last computed tomography scan). CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted, balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome is feasible, safe, and associated with an immediate and midterm persisting thoracoabdominal aortic remodeling.
25085319	Acute aortic dissection in pregnant women. Acute aortic dissection occurring during pregnancy represents a lethal risk to both the mother and fetus. Management of parturient with acute aortic dissection is complex. We report our experience of two pregnancies with type A acute aortic dissection. One patient is a 31-year-old pregnant woman (33rd gestational week) with a bicuspid aortic valve and the other is a 32-year-old pregnant woman (30th gestational week) with the Marfan syndrome. In both cases, a combined emergency operation consisting of Cesarean section, total hysterectomy prior to corrective surgery for aortic dissection was successfully performed within a relatively short period of time after the onset. Both patients' postoperative recovery was uneventful, and we achieved a favorable maternal and fetal outcome. 
31530070	An Endoscopic Solution to Mitral Regurgitation in a Complex Patient With Marfan Syndrome. Cardiac presentations of Marfan syndrome are not uncommon. Patients with Marfan syndrome can present with aortic pathology, valvular pathology, or both. Hence, Marfan syndrome patients can undergo more than one cardiac surgery in their lifetime. Endoscopic mitral valve surgery can be a good alternative to redo sternotomy. We present a case of a 77-year-old woman who had an aortic root replacement and replacement of the ascending aorta. She presented to our center 13 years later with severe mitral regurgitation. Femoral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass was not possible due to the presence of a type B aortic dissection that occurred sometime after the initial procedure. Mitral valve replacement was performed with an empty beating heart using axillary artery inflow with an excellent result.
25974974	Femtosecond Laser-assisted Cataract Surgery in Patients With Marfan Syndrome and Subluxated Lens. PURPOSE: To report femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgeries in patients with Marfan syndrome with mild, moderate, and severe lens subluxation. METHODS: Case reports. RESULTS: Two patients with Marfan syndrome underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (Alcon LenSx Lasers Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA). One patient had a mild lens subluxation in one eye and a moderate lens subluxation in the fellow eye. The other patient had a severe lens subluxation in one eye. In all eyes, the laser was able to perform a circular and free-floating anterior capsulotomy and lens fragmentation. In two of the eyes it was also helpful in decreasing corneal astigmatism by making corneal intrastromal relaxing incisions. There were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is an effective approach for cataract surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome with mild, moderate, and even severe lens subluxation, with the benefits of causing minimal further zonular damage and being able to treat corneal astigmatism with relaxing incisions.
25520047	Mid-term outcomes of cardiovascular surgery for patients with Marfan syndrome. OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular manifestations determine the prognosis and survival of patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). We assessed the early and mid-term outcomes of cardiovascular surgery for this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients with MFS who underwent surgery in our department. The endpoint was the requirement for a second cardiovascular surgery, and death from any cause. RESULTS: From February 2002 to March 2013, we performed 24 surgeries on 13 patients with MFS. At the time of initial surgery, the patients' aged ranged from 19 to 64 years of age (mean 34.7 +- 11.3 years) and included 5 men (38.5 %). Five of 13 initial surgeries (38.5 %) were emergencies. Seven patients (53.8 %) presented with aortic dissection at initial surgery, and one of the remaining six patients suffered from new aortic dissection during follow-up. Eight patients (61.5 %) underwent a second surgery, and a second surgery was not required for 100, 75.0, and 53.6 % of patients at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The mean time interval between the first and the second surgeries was 52.8 +- 28.2 months. No patient died while hospitalized, and three subsequently died from unknown causes. Survival rates were 100, 90.9 and 64.9 % at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although we obtained satisfactory early outcomes for patients with MFS, there were three late deaths from unknown causes. Therefore, we recommend that patients with MFS should remain under close surveillance.
33370003	Growth-friendly Spinal Instrumentation in Marfan Syndrome Achieves Sustained Gains in Thoracic Height Amidst High Rates of Implant Failure. BACKGROUND: There are few reports on the surgical management of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Affected patients tend to have more rapid curve progression than those with idiopathic EOS, and their course is further complicated by medical comorbidities. As surgical techniques and implants for growing spines become more widely applied, this study seeks to better delineate the safety and efficacy of growth-friendly spinal instrumentation in treating this population. METHODS: A prospective registry of children treated for EOS was queried for MFS patients treated between 1996 and 2016. Forty-two patients underwent rib-based or spine-based growing instrumentation and were assessed on preoperative, surgical, and postoperative clinical and radiographic parameters including complications and reoperations. Subgroup analysis was performed based on spine-based versus rib-based fixation. RESULTS: Patients underwent their index surgery at a mean age of 5.5 years, when the major coronal curve and kyphosis measured 77 and 50 degrees, respectively. Over half were treated with traditional growing rods. Patients underwent 7.2 total surgical procedures-4.7 lengthening and 1.9 revision surgeries not including conversion to fusion-over a follow-up of 6.5 (+-4.1) years. Radiographic correction was greatest at index surgery but maintained over time, with a final thoracic height measuring 23.8 cm. Patients experienced a mean of 2.6 complications over the course of the study period; however, a small group of 6 patients experienced >=6 complications while over half of patients experienced 0 or 1. Implant failures represented 42% of all complications with infection and pulmonary complications following. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest report on patients with EOS and MFS. All subtypes of growth-friendly constructs reduced curve progression in this cohort, but complications and reoperations were nearly universal; patients were particularly plagued by implant failure and migration. Further collaborations are needed to enhance understanding of optimal timing and fixation constructs for those with MFS and other connective tissue diseases.
28606654	Management of Marfan Syndrome during pregnancy: A real world experience from a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service. BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is associated with increased maternal risk of cardiovascular events. Given the maternal and genetic risks, pre-conception counselling is essential to facilitate informed choices. Multidisciplinary antenatal care with regular imaging is mandatory and best delivered through a Joint Cardiac Obstetric Service (JCOS). The aim of this study was to compare the care delivered in a JCOS against recognised international standards (European Society of Cardiology (ESC)). METHODS: Pregnancies in women with MFS from 2005 to 2015 were identified from our institutional database. Patient records were reviewed and practice assessed against pre-determined standards based on ESC guidelines. RESULTS: There were 23 pregnancies in 15 women with MFS. 13/23 (57%) occurred in women with aortic dilatation at baseline. There were 3 important maternal cardiac events (type A dissection; deterioration in left ventricular function; significant left ventricular and progressive aortic dilatation). Four women did not have access to expert pre-conception counselling. These women were all referred to the JCOS late in established pregnancy. Imaging was often delayed and only 7/23 cases (30%) met the standard for minimum frequency of echocardiographic surveillance. Only 12/23 (52%) had pre-conception imaging of the whole aorta with CT/MRI. Distal aortic dilatation was identified in 7/23 cases but none of these underwent further MRI evaluation during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Despite having a dedicated JCOS, our data show that facilitating complete obstetric and cardiac care for this group remains challenging. Education of local care providers and timely referral for expert pre-conception counselling in a JCOS are key.
29631308	[S2-Guideline: Pediatric Flat Foot]. In pediatric flat foot a differentiation has to be made between the flexible and the rigid form. The diagnosis is based on the history, clinical examination as well as pedobarography, gait analysis and imaging techniques. It is important to rule out neuropediatric conditions such as muscular dystrophies, Ehlers-Danlos- or Marfan syndrome. In children six years of age and younger a flexible flat foot is nearly always physiological (97% of all 19 months old children). Up to the age of ten years the medial column of the foot is developing. Only a minority of children (4% in ten year olds) has a persistent or progressive deformity. Beyond to age of ten there is a danger of deformity decompensation as well as an increased rigidity. Only a minority of children develops some pain (< 2%). A clear risk factor for persistent pediatric flat foot is obesity (62% of six year old children with flat foot are obese). Pathogenetic factors include muscular, bony or soft tissue conditions. However, there specific rule is still unclear. Prevention consists in a thorough parent information about the normal development as well as encouragement of regular sportive activities. Soft and large enough shoes should be carried as a protection. Barfoot walking has to be encouraged on uneven grounds. If physiotherapy is needed different methods can be applied. Orthosis treatment should include a proprioceptive approach. Surgical interventions in children are rare. If surgical treatment is planned a detailed algorhythm should be used before utilizing one of the many different surgical methods.
31981144	Progressive double major scoliotic curve with concurrent lumbosacral spondylolisthesis in a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome treated with anterior scoliosis correction. STUDY DESIGN: Case report (review of patient records, imaging, and pulmonary function tests) and literature review. OBJECTIVES: To describe the case of a skeletally immature patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent anterior scoliosis correction (ASC) and muscle-sparing posterior far lateral interbody fusion (FLIF) in a two-stage procedure to correct progressive severe double major scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Patients with Marfan syndrome suffer from rapidly progressive scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Operative treatment has typically been limited to PSF, but newer techniques may be less invasive and provide more spine motion. METHODS: A 12-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome, spondylolisthesis, and severe progressive scoliosis underwent a two-stage procedure to achieve correction. Muscle-sparing posterior FLIF of the spondylolisthesis from L4-S1 was initially performed, followed 1 week later by ASC from right T4-T11 and left T11-L3 using an anterior screw/cord construct. RESULTS: Follow-up from the index procedures for the spondylolisthesis and scoliosis is 35 months. No significant complications occurred in perioperative and postoperative follow-up periods. At the 13-month follow-up, the double major scoliosis showed continued curve correction via growth modulation and overcorrection of the lumbar to - 13 . A revision lengthening procedure of the anterior cord from T11-L3 was performed. An asymptomatic elevated hemidiaphragm was discovered at 6 weeks postoperation, which was believed to be secondary to retraction neuropraxia and subsequently improved. At 21 months postlengthening and 35 months postindex procedure, she is skeletally mature and the curves have maintained correction in both the coronal and sagittal planes without any further complications. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior scoliosis correction of both a thoracic and lumbar curve combined with an L4-S1 PSF was effective for this patient and may be promising for patients with Marfan syndrome, progressive scoliosis, and spondylolisthesis. Overcorrection can be planned for and easily corrected by inserting a new cord of a different length.
32079842	Novel double-flanged technique for managing Marfan syndrome and microspherophakia. A new technique for fixating the capsular bag in patients with ectopia lentis is presented. In this technique, the capsulorhexis is performed using a femtosecond laser, followed by the insertion of a standard capsular tension ring to redistribute capsular forces. The nucleus is hydroprolapsed into the anterior chamber and nuclear disassembly is performed above the iris plane to reduce zonular stress. Finally, a 5-0 polypropylene monofilament is used to fixate a capsular tension segment and subluxated capsular bag. This novel double-flanged method, achieved with cautery, does not require direct suturing of the monofilament on the sclera. This article describes the use of this new technique in 3 eyes, 2 in patients with Marfan syndrome and 1 in a patient with microspherophakia.

31546497	Bimanual irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis and use of a small incision for 4-point scleral-sutured foldable intraocular lens and anterior vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Purpose: This study evaluated bimanual intracapsular irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis with use of a small incision for 4-point scleral fixation of a foldable posterior-chamber intraocular lens (IOL) and anterior vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 18 eyes from 10 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent surgical intervention for ectopia lentis at our clinic between July 2012 and September 2018. In this study, intraoperative and postoperative complications, uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell density were evaluated. Results: No intraoperative complications were reported. In all cases, early postoperative evaluation revealed a clear cornea, round pupil, and well-centered IOL. Mean logMAR uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.09 preoperatively to 0.56 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.45 preoperatively to 0.17 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Aside from transient ocular hypertension, no postoperative complications were reported. Conclusion: The combined surgical technique presented above yields excellent visual outcomes with an extremely low incidence of complications. This approach is simple, safe, and effective in the treatment of ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan syndrome.
33078267	Spinal fusion in pediatric patients with marfan syndrome: a nationwide assessment on short-term outcomes and readmission risk. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to utilize the National Readmission Database (NRD) to determine estimates for complication rates, 90-day readmission rates, and hospital costs associated with spinal fusion in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: The 2012-2015 NRD databases were queried for all pediatric (< 19 years old) patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion surgery. The primary outcome variables in this study were index admission complications and 90-day readmissions. RESULTS: A total of 249 patients with Marfan syndrome underwent spinal fusion surgery between 2012 and 2015 (mean age +- standard deviation at the time of surgery: 14 +- 2.0, 132 (53%) female). 25 (10.1%) were readmitted within 90 days of the index hospital discharge date. Overall, 59.7% of patients experienced at least one complication during the index admission. Unplanned 90-day readmission could be predicted by older age (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.2, p = 0.006), Medicaid insurance status (56.0, 3.8-820.0, p = 0.003), and experiencing an inpatient medical complication (42.9, 4.6-398.7, p = 0.001). Patients were readmitted for wound dehiscence (8 patients, 3.2%), nervous system related complications (3 patients, 1.2%), and postoperative infectious related complications (4 patients, 1.6%). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate on a national level the complications and potential risk factors for 90-day hospital readmission for patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion. Patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing spinal fusion often present with multiple medical comorbidities that must be managed carefully perioperatively to reduce inpatient complications and early hospital readmissions.
31129614	Maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by Marfan syndrome. OBJECTIVES: Information to guide counselling and management for pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is limited. We therefore conducted a UK multicentre study. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of women with MFS delivering between January 1998 and March 2018 in 12 UK centres reporting data on maternal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: In total, there were 258 pregnancies in 151 women with MFS (19 women had prior aortic root replacements), including 226 pregnancies >=24 weeks (two sets of twins), 20 miscarriages and 12 pregnancy terminations. Excluding miscarriages and terminations, there were 221 live births in 139 women. Only 50% of women received preconception counselling. There were no deaths, but five women experienced aortic dissection (1.9%; one type A and four type B-one had a type B dissection at 12 weeks and subsequent termination of pregnancy). Five women required cardiac surgery postpartum. No predictors for aortic dissection could be identified. The babies of the 131 (65.8%) women taking beta-blockers were on average 316 g lighter (p<0.001). Caesarean section rates were high (50%), particularly in women with dilated aortic roots. In 55 women, echocardiographic aortic imaging was available prepregnancy and postpregnancy; there was a small but significant average increase in AoR size of 0.84 mm (Median follow-up 2.3 months) CONCLUSION: There were no maternal deaths, and the aortic dissection rate was 1.9% (mainly type B). There with no identifiable factors associated with aortic dissection in our cohort. Preconception counselling rates were low and need improvement. Aortic size measurements increased marginally following pregnancy.
31003918	The effects of losartan versus beta-blockers on cardiovascular protection in marfan syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Variable effects of beta-blockers (BB) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were reported to retard aortic root growth in Marfan syndrome (MFS). This study aimed to compare the effects of BB therapy and ARB-related therapies on cardiovascular protection in MFS. METHODS: Studies of randomized control trials comparing the efficacy of only-BB and ARB-related (only-ARB or ARB-plus-BB) therapies for MFS published before July 31, 2018 in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were selected. The outcomes included changes in aortic growth and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Eight trials involving 1381 patients were included. Patients received only-BB and ARB-related therapies did not differ significantly in changes in aortic growth (aortic root diameter: standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11-0.19, p = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (aortic dissection: Peto odds ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% CI: 0.42-6.72, p = 0.47; aortic surgery: risk ratio = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.66-1.41, p = 0.86; death: Peto OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 0.39-19.82, p = 0.31). Subgroup analysis revealed that ARB-plus-BB therapy exhibited nonsignificantly better outcomes than only-BB therapy (aortic root diameter: SMD = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.22-0.45, p = 0.52; ascending aorta diameter: SMD = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.07-0.27, p = 0.26; aortic surgery: Peto OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.75-1.61, p = 0.62). CONCLUSION: For cardiovascular protection in MFS, only-ARB therapy is not inferior to only-BB therapy. Moreover, the outcomes of ARB-plus-BB therapy seemed to be favourable to those of only-BB therapy.
35152942	Assessment of pleural pressure during sleep in Marfan syndrome. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have a high risk for aortic aneurysms. They are also susceptible to sleep-disordered breathing that may expose them to highly negative intrathoracic pressures known to increase aortic transmural pressure, which may accelerate aortic dilatation. Our objective was to quantify overnight intrathoracic pressure changes during sleep in snoring patients with MFS and the therapeutic effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: We used a questionnaire to identify self-reported snoring patients with MFS. In these patients, we monitored intrathoracic pressure using esophageal pressure (Pes) during overnight baseline and CPAP sleep studies. We defined a peak-inspiratory Pes (Pespeak-insp) < - 5 cm H2O as greater than normal and examined the distribution of Pespeak-insp during baseline and CPAP studies. RESULTS: In our sample of 23 snorers with MFS, we found that 70% of sleep breaths exhibited Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O, with apnea/hypopneass accounting for only 12%, suggesting prevalent stable flow-limited breathing and snoring. In a subset (n = 12) with Pes monitoring during a CPAP night, CPAP lowered the mean proportion of breaths with Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O from 83.7% +- 14.9% to 3.6% +- 3.0% (P < .001). In addition, contemporaneous aortic root diameter was associated with the mean Pespeak-insp during inspiratory flow-limited breathing and apneas/hypopneas (beta = -0.05, r = .675, P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: The sleep state in MFS revealed prolonged exposure to exaggerated negative inspiratory Pes, which was reversible with CPAP. Since negative intrathoracic pressure can contribute to thoracic aortic stress and aortic dilatation, snoring may be a reversible risk factor for progression of aortic pathology in MFS.

28304197	Endovascular treatment of a dural arteriovenous fistula in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: A case report. Background Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. The manifestations of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.
35275761	D-dimer in Marfan syndrome: effect of obstructive sleep apnea induced blood pressure surges. Aortic dissection and rupture are the major causes of premature death in persons with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a rare genetic disorder featuring cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular impairments. We and others have found that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) confers significant vascular stress in this population and may accelerate aortic disease progression. We hypothesized that D-dimer, a diagnostic biomarker for several types of vascular injury that is also elevated in persons with MFS with aortic enlargement, may be sensitive to cardiovascular stresses caused by OSA. To test this concept, we recruited 16 persons with MFS without aortic dissection and randomized them to two nights of polysomnography, without (baseline) and with OSA treatment: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In addition to scoring OSA by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), beat-by-beat systolic BP (SBP) and pulse-pressure (PP) fluctuations were quantified. Morning blood samples were also assayed for D-dimer levels. In this cohort (male:female, 10:6; age, 36 +- 13 yr; aortic diameter, 4 +- 1 cm), CPAP eliminated OSA (AHI: 20 +- 17 vs. 3 +- 2 events/h, P = 0.001) and decreased fluctuations in SBP (13 +- 4 vs. 9 +- 3 mmHg, P = 0.011) and PP (7 +- 2 vs. 5 +- 2 mmHg, P = 0.013). CPAP also reduced D-dimer levels from 1,108 +- 656 to 882 +- 532 ng/mL (P = 0.023). Linear regression revealed a positive association between the maximum PP during OSA and D-dimer in both the unadjusted (r = 0.523, P = 0.038) and a model adjusted for contemporaneous aortic root diameter (r = 0.733, P = 0.028). Our study revealed that overnight CPAP reduces D-dimer levels commensurate with the elimination of OSA and concomitant hemodynamic fluctuations. Morning D-dimer measurements together with OSA screening might serve as predictors of vascular injury in MFS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY What is New? Surges in blood pressure caused by obstructive sleep apnea during sleep increase vascular stress and D-dimer levels in Marfan syndrome. Elevations in D-dimer can be lowered with CPAP. What is Noteworthy? D-dimer levels might serve as a marker for determining the significance of obstructive sleep apnea in persons with Marfan syndrome. D-dimer or obstructive sleep apnea screening is a potential method to identify persons with Marfan syndrome at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.
31513900	Pigment dispersion syndrome and response to laser peripheral iridotomies in a child with Marfan syndrome. Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma have rarely been reported in Marfan syndrome and have never been reported in a child with Marfan syndrome. We report the clinical and ultrasound biomicroscopic findings of PDS in a 14-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome and its favorable response to bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy.
27483660	[Safe and Effective Analgesia with Bilateral Continuous TAP Block for a Patient with Marfan Syndrome after Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair]. A patient with Marfan syndrome underwent emergency open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She was referred to our department for postoperative analgesia. Taking the risk of possible dural ectasia into consideration, we avoided epidural block. Alternatively, we performed bilateral continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with sufficient analgesia. Lumbosacral dural ectasia is frequently observed in patients with Marfan syndrome. A few reports described that their fragile dura may contribute to an increased risk of dural puncture and postdural puncture headache (PDPH). Thus, in planning neuraxial block for a patient with Marfan syndrome, the possible consequences of lumbosacral dural ectasia should be considered. A case we herein present shows bilateral continuous TAP block could be a safe and effective alternative to epidural block.
25662437	"Early and medium term results of the sleeve valve-sparing procedure for aortic root ectasia. BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate our experience of using a simplified aortic valve sleeve procedure to treat aortic root ectasia and aneurysms with or without aortic regurgitation. In experienced hands, 2 aortic valve-sparing procedures, ie, Yacoub and David, have yielded excellent long-term results in the treatment of aortic root aneurysms, with or without aortic regurgitation. However, these techniques are demanding and not widely used. Recently, a new and simplified valve-sparing technique, named ""sleeve procedure,"" has been proposed, and has yielded encouraging early results. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with aortic root aneurysms underwent sleeve procedures from October 2006 to October 2012. Follow-up data (clinical 100% complete and echocardiographic 93% complete) were acquired from our outpatient clinic or from the referring cardiologist. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.5 +- 12.5 years, 79% were male, 16 (18%) had a bicuspid valve, 3 had Marfan syndrome, and 2 had aortic dissection. Over a mean clinical follow-up of 34 +- 19 months, 2 patients died from noncardiac causes and 1 was reoperated on for the recurrence of aortic regurgitation. On follow-up echocardiography after a mean of 18 +- 9 months, aortic regurgitation was absent/negligible, mild or moderate in 62%, 37%, and 1% of patients, respectively, and the diameters of the annulus, Valsalva sinuses, and sinotubular junction were 27.3 + 2.2, 37.0 + 3.4, and 30.6 + 3.1 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our encouraging early and medium term results suggest that the sleeve procedure is a safe and effective aortic valve-sparing technique for the treatment of aortic root ectasia and aneurysm. However, longer follow-up is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions."

A Marfan syndrome child with contractural arachnodactyly deformity of both hands was admitted to our unit in June 2015. The left and right middle fingers and ring fingers of the child received the continuous "" Z"" skin flap and "" V-Y"" plasty to reduce the palmar tension on the skin and release the contracture. Due to the improper therapeutic strategy and the underestimation of effect of underlying lesions of Marfan syndrome on the therapeutic strategy, the right middle finger of child was with ischemic necrosis and amputated, and the finger tip was accompanied with distension and paroxysmal neuropathic pain at a specified future date. The skin flaps of the other three surgical fingers were with local necrosis and scar healing. The child was complicated by distal interphalangeal joints stiffness and some serious complications post-discharge. Combined with this case, the similar disorders are not recommended to carry out one-stage operation."

Valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the reimplantation technique (T. David-V operation) has become the gold standard in patients with annuloaortic ectasia, given that the aortic valve is morphologically intact or repairable. The benefits of preserving the native aortic valve extend beyond avoiding the inconvenience and complications of prolonged exposure to anticoagulants. This video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to the T. David-V procedure in a male patient with Marfan syndrome, annuloaortic ectasia, and moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation.
28371942	Physical Activity Self-Management and Coaching Compared to Social Interaction in Huntington Disease: Results From the ENGAGE-HD Randomized, Controlled Pilot Feasibility Trial. BACKGROUND: Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established. RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined intervention logic model. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures may have introduced bias. CONCLUSIONS: An HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation.
18590443	"Long-term follow-up of Huntington disease treated by bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus. Deep brain stimulation is now accepted as a safe and efficient treatment for movement disorders including selected types of dystonia and dyskinesia. Very little, however, is known about its effect on other movement disorders, particularly for ""choreic"" movements. Huntington disease is a fatal autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement disorders, progressive cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. Bilateral chronic stimulation of the internal globus pallidus was performed to control choreic movements in a 60-year-old man with a 10-year history of Huntington disease. Chronic deep brain stimulation resulted in remarkable improvement of choreic movements. Postoperative improvement was sustained after 4 years of follow-up with a marked improvement in daily quality of life."
21960468	Adherence to use of a home-based exercise DVD in people with Huntington disease: participants' perspectives. BACKGROUND: Individualized exercise instruction on a regular basis may be desirable for people with Huntington disease (HD). Sustained interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management. It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD, developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program. Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable. Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy sessions or upon completion of a therapy program.
23108692	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of latrepirdine in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. BACKGROUND Latrepirdine is an orally administered experimental small molecule that was initially developed as an antihistamine and subsequently was shown to stabilize mitochondrial membranes and function, which might be impaired in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920946.
28947114	The role of rehabilitation therapy in Huntington disease. The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.
156313	Isoniazid therapy of Huntington disease. We describe clinical and biochemical changes in seven patients with Huntington disease given isoniazid (INH) in dosages three to five greater than normally used in tuberculosis. Because INH inhibits the enzyme gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-T), and increases GABA content in the brains of experimental animals, it might correct the brain GABA deficiency characteristic of Huntington disease. Of six patients treated long enough to be clinically evaluated, one showed marked and two others showed signifciant improvement. High-dose INH therapy carries serious toxic risks, which are influenced by patients' acetylator phenotypes. Nevertheless, results are sufficiently promising to warrant further controlled trials of INH or other GABA-T inhibitors in Huntington disease.
34291654	Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Hospitalized People With Huntington Disease: A National Cross-Sectional Study. BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition. These findings have implications for the adaptation of inpatient PC models to meet the needs of persons with HD.
35698434	Does physical activity improve motor function and gait in huntington disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.
31907286	Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.
27747393	Exercise effects in Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms across a wide range of neurological domains, including cognitive and motor dysfunction. There is still no causative treatment for HD but environmental factors such as passive lifestyle may modulate disease onset and progression. In humans, multidisciplinary rehabilitation has a positive impact on cognitive functions. However, a specific role for exercise as a component of an environmental enrichment effect has been difficult to demonstrate. We aimed at investigating whether endurance training (ET) stabilizes the progression of motor and cognitive dysfunction and ameliorates cardiovascular function in HD patients. Twelve male HD patients (mean +- SD, 54.8 +- 7.1 years) and twelve male controls (49.1 +- 6.8 years) completed 26 weeks of endurance training. Before and after the training intervention, clinical assessments, exercise physiological tests, and a body composition measurement were conducted and a muscle biopsy was taken from M. vastus lateralis. To examine the natural course of the disease, HD patients were additionally assessed 6 months prior to ET. During the ET period, there was a motor deficit stabilization as indicated by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor section score in HD patients (baseline: 18.6 +- 9.2, pre-training: 26.0 +- 13.7, post-training: 26.8 +- 16.4). Peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) significantly increased in HD patients ( [Formula: see text] = +0.33 +- 0.28 l) and controls ( [Formula: see text] = +0.29 +- 0.41 l). No adverse effects of the training intervention were reported. Our results confirm that HD patients are amenable to a specific exercise-induced therapeutic strategy indicated by an increased cardiovascular function and a stabilization of motor function.
36429634	Home-Based Exercise to Improve Motor Functions, Cognitive Functions, and Quality of Life in People with Huntington's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Exercise in different settings has become a fundamental part of Huntington's disease (HD) management. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of home-based exercises (HBE) in HD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HBE on motor, cognitive, or health-related quality of life (QoL) outcomes in HD were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD), the 95% confidence interval, and p-values were calculated by comparing the outcomes change between HBE and control groups. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The included RCTs prescribed different types of HBEs, i.e., aerobic strengthening, walking, balance, and fine motor exercises. The HBE protocol length was between 6 and 36 weeks. The meta-analyses showed a significant effect of HBE intervention on motor function measure by Unified Huntington Disease Rating and overall QoL measure by Short Form-36 post-treatment respectively, [SMD = 0.481, p = 0.048], [SMD = 0.378, p = 0.003]. The pooled analysis did not detect significant changes in cognition, gait characteristics, or functional balance scales. The current study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL. No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients. However, these results should be taken with caution due to the limited available evidence. Well-designed clinical studies that consider the disease severity and stages are required in the future.
28628549	A Classification System to Guide Physical Therapy Management in Huntington Disease: A Case Series. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).
18394562	Symptomatic treatment of Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive heredoneurodegenerative disease manifested by chorea and other hyperkinetic (dystonia, myoclonus, tics) and hypokinetic (parkinsonism) movement disorders. In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.
29143208	"A new measure for end of life planning, preparation, and preferences in Huntington disease: HDQLIFE end of life planning. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (""HDQLIFE"") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care."
29089255	Huntington disease care: From the past to the present, to the future. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.
18467429	Physical therapy intervention for people with Huntington disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical symptoms of Huntington disease (HD) include progressive movement disorders, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes, all of which affect an individual's ability to participate in activities of daily living. To date, very few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical therapy trials.

8866495	"Characteristics of individuals with Huntington disease in long-term care. This is a retrospective review of 97 Huntington disease (HD) patients living in long-term care facilities in the Twin Cities. The purpose of the study was to describe the demographic features, patterns of behavior, weight change, nursing issues, medication use, and hospitalization in this population. On admission to the nursing home, the ""average"" HD patient was of either sex, 45 years old, previously employed, a high school graduate, and not married. One third had severe behavior problems. Half gained and half lost weight; weight loss was not a predictor of death. Almost all used central nervous system-active drugs, most commonly neuroleptics. Eighty-four percent were ambulatory on admission, but 88% of those who died were nonambulatory at the time of death. We concluded that (a) HD patients are demographically different from other residents of long-term care facilities, (b) weight gain can occur in some late-stage patients, (c) negative behavior is a significant problem but is restricted to a subset of patients, and (d) adapting creatively to increasing multifaceted disability is the greatest challenge to the staff in facilities caring for HD patients."
36513779	Cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise on cognitive function in Huntington's disease: a systematic review. Cognitive impairment is prevalent in Huntington's disease (HD), with no treatments currently available. While cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise have shown efficacy in improving cognition in other populations, they have not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review aims to examine the effects of cognitive and exercise interventions on cognition in HD, along with effects on psychosocial function, functional independence, and neuroimaging outcomes. Seventeen studies (three cognitive, seven exercise, seven combining cognitive and physical exercise) were included. While there was generally low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function. Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive. Larger studies should seek to confirm the benefits of cognitive and physical interventions, and further explore changes in functional independence and neural outcomes.
11176966	"Progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) ""don't know."" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living."
36706436	Factors Associated with the Place of Death in Huntington Disease: Analysis of Enroll-HD. Background: Most people prefer to die at home. Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.
26863152	Development and Delivery of a Physical Activity Intervention for People With Huntington Disease: Facilitating Translation to Clinical Practice. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).
21796039	Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care: lessons learned from a cohort of nursing home residents with advanced Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that progresses over decades and is ultimately terminal. As HD advances, patients are frequently placed in institutional care settings, including nursing homes and hospices where family, nursing staff, and interdisciplinary team members are challenged to help patients live to their highest potential and die with dignity. Edgemoor, a distinct part of the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, is a regional referral facility for patients with HD. Over the past 8 years, we have cared for 53 patients with advanced HD and describe our experiences by presenting their demographic characteristics and the lessons we have learned in caring for them. Ultimately, we found that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care Initiative provided a meaningful framework for setting clinical priorities. This framework is used to summarize the clinical lessons that nursing staff and interdisciplinary team members learned about caring well for institutionalized individuals with advanced HD.
24375941	Results of the citalopram to enhance cognition in Huntington disease trial. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate citalopram for executive functioning in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Thirty-three adults with HD, cognitive complaints, and no depression (Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] rating scale <= 12) were administered citalopram 20 mg or placebo (7 visits, 20 weeks), with practice and placebo run-ins. The primary outcome was change in executive functioning. RESULTS: The intent to treat analysis was controlled for practice effects, comparing visits 1 and 2 to visits 5 and 6 for citalopram versus placebo. There were no significant benefits on the executive function composite (treatment-placebo mean difference -0.167; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.361 to 0.028; P = .092). Citalopram participants showed improved clinician-rated depression symptoms on the HAM-D (t = -2.02; P = 0.05). There were no group differences on motor ratings, self-reported executive functions, psychiatric symptoms, or functional status. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that short-term treatment with citalopram improved executive functions in HD. Despite excluding patients with active depression, participants on citalopram showed improved mood, raising the possibility of efficacy for subsyndromal depression in HD.

24699718	Quadruple deep brain stimulation in Huntington's disease, targeting pallidum and subthalamic nucleus: case report and review of the literature. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents an established treatment option in a growing number of movement disorders. Recent case reports suggest beneficial effect of globus pallidus internus (GPi)-DBS in selected patients suffering from Huntington's disease with marked disabling chorea. We present a 41-year-old man with genetically confirmed HD following quadruple GPi- and subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS. Motor function was assessed by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) presurgery and postsurgery for up to 4 years. Furthermore, cognitive, neuropsychiatric state and quality of life (QoL) including life satisfaction (QLS) were annually evaluated. Chorea assessed by AIMS and UHDRS subscores improved by 52 and 55 %, 45 and 60 %, 35 and 45 % and 55-66 % at 1-4 years, respectively, compared to presurgical state following GPi-STN-DBS. During these time periods bradykinesia did not increase following separate STN- and combined GPi-STN-DBS compared to presurgical state. Mood, QoL and QLS were ameliorated. However, dysexecutive symptoms increased at 4 years postsurgery. The present case report suggests that bilateral GPi- and STN-DBS may represent a new treatment avenue in selected HD patients. Clinically, GPi-DBS attenuated chorea and was associated with a larger effect-adverse effect window compared to STN-DBS. However, GPi-DBS-induced bradykinesia may emerge as one main limitation of GPi-DBS in HD. Thus, quadruple GPi-STN-DBS may be indicated, if separate GPi-DBS does not result in sufficient control of motor symptoms. Future controlled studies need to confirm if the present anecdotal observation of additive beneficial effects of GPi- and STN-DBS in a HD patient with severe generalized chorea and relatively intact cognitive and affective functions indeed represents a new therapeutic option.
28531758	Factors associated with Mediterranean diet adherence in Huntington's disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the importance of the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) and dietary intake as environmental neuroprotective factors in Huntington's disease (HD); so, we evaluated and analyzed the prevalence and factors associated with MeDi adherence, and dietary intake in HD. METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.
28947117	Making a measurable difference in advanced Huntington disease care. Neurologists' role in the care of people with advanced Huntington disease (HD) (total functional capacity <7), often limited by a lack of clinical research to support good practice, includes the following: (1) provide comprehensive health records to an interdisciplinary care staff before admission to a more intense care setting (home health services, day program, assisted living, group home, long-term skilled nursing facility, palliative care); (2) consult with and refer to rehabilitation (occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language pathology), behavioral and psychiatric professionals for problem-solving strategies, which must be reviewed with direct care staff before implementation; (3) encourage and support qualitative and quantitative interdisciplinary research studies, and randomized controlled studies of nonpharmacologic interventions; and (4) assist in the development of meaningful measures to further document what works to provide a good quality of life for the patient and family and a comfortable thoughtful approach to a good death. Collaborative models of care depend on: (1) clear communication; (2) ongoing education and support programs; with (3) pharmacologic and rehabilitation interventions, always in the context of respect for the person with HD, a preservation of the individuals' dignity, autonomy, and individual preferences.
33852093	[Which interventions are recommended in the last phase of Huntington disease?] Huntington Disease is a chronically progressive and neurodegenerative disease, which leads to death after 10 to 30 years of suffering and worsening. When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.

29383957	"Physician perceptions of pharmacologic treatment options for chorea associated with Huntington disease in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients ""often"" or ""almost always"". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice."
27380342	Effect of Deutetrabenazine on Chorea Among Patients With Huntington Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.
16340384	Efficacy of levetiracetam in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug characterized by a wide spectrum of action; no pharmacologic interaction and poor adverse events are reported. In animal models, effects of LEV are observed in basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LEV in reducing involuntary movements in subjects affected by Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: This was a single-center, short-term, open-label, controlled study. Patients had LEV as add-on therapy for 6 months. In the first visit patients were rated according to the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Every 2 months they were submitted to all these tests. LEV was added at the dose of 500 mg twice daily for the first 2 months and then the dosage was increased until 1000 mg twice daily for the next 4 more months. The authors enrolled 22 patients: 15 were assigned to the LEV group and 7 were enrolled as control subjects. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were experienced by the treated patients. After 6 months of treatment patients on LEV showed a significant reduction of involuntary movements, with a slight improvement of functional capacity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results of this short-term, prospective, controlled study indicates that in HD patients, LEV is effective in reducing involuntary movements, thus improving the quality of life.
153484	Long term treatment of Huntington disease with L-glutamate and pyridoxine. Decreased levels of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, have been found in the brains of patients with Huntington disease. In an attempt to augment GABA-mediated neurotransmission, daily doses of 25 gm of L-glutamate (the substrate for glutamic acid decarboxylase) and 500 mg of pyridoxine, its cofactor, were given to five patients with Huntington disease. This regimen was continued for 2 years. Assessment of motor and behavioral function indicated no improvement on this regimen.
25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management. Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative brain disease clinically manifested by the characteristic triad: physical symptoms including involuntary movements and poor coordination, cognitive changes with less ability to organize routine tasks, and some emotional and behavioral disturbances. For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome. 
25929771	Correction of Brachymetatarsia and Medial Angulation of the Great Toe of Apert Foot By Distraction Osteogenesis: A Review of 7 Years of Experience. BACKGROUND: Apert foot anomalies may cause severe problems such as pain and development of callus formation related to weight redistribution, problems with footwear, and gait disturbances that may limit their daily activities. The main purpose of this study was to review our experience with distraction osteogenesis for the correction of brachymetatarsia and the great toe angulation of the patients with Apert syndrome. METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 7 patients (14 extremities) followed up for Apert syndrome who underwent distraction for the correction of bilateral congenital brachymetatarsia and angulation of the great toe between 2004 and 2008. Correction of the metatarsal inclination angle, the medial angulation of the great toe, the percentage of lengthening, and lengthening rates of distracted bones were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 4 to 8 years at the distraction operation, with a mean age of 5.4+-1.3 years, and the average length of follow-up was 86.6+-21.0 months. The length of the first metatarsal bone increased significantly from the average length of 32.6+-5.7 mm to an average of 46.7+-6.5 mm (P<0.001). The mean lengthening rate and lengthening percentages of distracted bones were 0.4%+-0.1%/month and 30.2%+-6.4%/month, respectively. Preoperative and postoperative metatarsal inclination angles were at a mean of 43.8+-5.12 and 32.6+-3.8, respectively, and the correction of metatarsal inclination was considered as statistically significant (P<0.001). The mean angulation of the great toe reduced significantly from 49.8+-11.76 to 13.2+-8.5 degrees after distraction (P<0.001). Minor complications such as pin loosening, pin-tract infection, and early union that required reoperation were observed in 5 extremities (35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic features of Apert foot may lead to complaints that may limit patients' daily activities and require as much attention as associated hand and craniofacial anomalies. Distraction appears to be an effective and safe approach for the simultaneous correction of the shortness of the first ray and medial angulation of the great toe. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
29891270	Central Coalition Osteotomy of Phalangeal Synostoses in the Management of the Type III Apert Hand. PURPOSE: We report a technique in the management of the type III Apert hand. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of a 5-fingered hand in 3 stages. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with Apert syndrome and type III hands surgically treated at our institution from 1995 through 2014. In all cases, syndactyly release was performed in 3 stages with prioritization of the border digits. In addition, limited retrograde, axial osteotomies between the phalangeal segments of the conjoined index, middle, and ring fingers were performed during the first stage. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical presentation, operative findings, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve pediatric patients with type III hands underwent syndactyly release. Median patient age was 10.0, 15.8, and 29.6 months at operative stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A thumb and 4 fingers were achieved for all but 1 hand. The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days for each stage. No infections or major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate this method as a safe and effective means of creating 5 digits in the Apert patient with type III hands. Our opinion is that the additional aesthetic and functional gains offset the requirement of a 3-stage approach. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
24709088	Assessing the corrective effects of facial bipartition distraction in Apert syndrome using geometric morphometrics. UNLABELLED: Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia. This study looks to identify to what extent bipartition distraction corrects the morphological abnormalities of this condition. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) scans of 10 patients with Apert syndrome (12-21 years) were identified from the Great Ormond Street Hospital database. To analyse preoperative and postoperative scans, 98 landmarks and 13 normal skulls were used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyse patterns in the datasets. Within each group, eigenvectors were identified that demonstrated the aspects of the skull where most variations were found. The analysis allowed both global shape measurement and local proportions. Postoperative and normal scans both showed the same first three principal components. Warping from preoperative to postoperative illustrates midface advancement and inward rotation of the orbits. Postoperative to normal warps demonstrate some remaining differences. The reliability of the used land marks varied between 77% and 95% for the highly reproducible landmarks between the two observers. 95% versus 100% were at least acceptable reproducible landmarks. This study allows us to understand the way bipartition distraction corrects the abnormalities of the Apert skull. Analysing the surgical outcome of facial bipartition with geometric morphometrics shows that some major Apert characteristics are corrected. Using the data and the output of further studies, surgical procedures can be adapted in order to achieve a postoperative result closer to the normal population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic clinical question Level IV.

25313108	Visual surveillance in craniosynostoses. Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures that may be isolated or syndromic. These children can have multiple developmental issues including speech, hearing, and vision, in addition to the aesthetic issue of an abnormally shaped skull and midfacial hypoplasia. As the aesthetic outcomes of craniofacial surgery have improved, attention has turned on the functional outcomes and visual loss is a well-known problem with these patients. In the past 15 years, a greater understanding of the causes of visual loss has developed. Factors such as amblyopia, corneal exposure, and optic neuropathy are all now looked for to prevent or reduce visual loss. Optic neuropathy is caused by craniocerebral disproportion (though to a lesser extent than originally thought), cerebral hypo perfusion, hydrocephalus, and obstructive sleep apnea. Amblyopia is due to increased incidence of strabismus, anisometropia, astigmatism, and ametropia in these cases. A comprehensive approach to managing these children's visual function allows the clinician to reduce potential visual loss in children with craniosynostoses especially the syndromic variety. 
33136789	Apert Hand Reconstruction: Do Partial-Thickness Skin Grafts Result in Flexion Scar Contracture? BACKGROUND: Hand reconstruction for patients with Apert syndrome is a critical step in comprehensive care and enables this population to gain significant hand function. Digit separation for Apert syndrome, as described in most algorithms, is finalized using local flaps and full-thickness skin grafts. The objective of this study is to report our experience using local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts after digit separation for Apert hand reconstruction. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed with Apert patients whose hands were reconstructed between January 2007 and July 2019 using local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts after digit separation. Demographic data and outcome data were verified and recorded. RESULTS: Out of a total of 75 Apert patients who underwent hand reconstruction, 12 underwent hand reconstruction utilizing local flaps and partial-thickness skin grafts. The average patient age at the time of the first procedure was 1.9 years. These 12 patients were stratified according to Upton hand severity, 3 being type I (25%), 3 being type II (25%) and 6 being type III (50%). Mean follow up provided to all patients in this study was 1.8 years and donor site-related complications were seen in 2 patients (16.6%). No flexion scar contracture was observed in any of the patients who received partial-thickness skin grafts. CONCLUSIONS: The use of local flaps along with partial-thickness skin grafts to finalize digit separation for patients with Apert syndrome is an effective technique that reduces donor site morbidity and does not result in flexion scar contracture.
28906337	A Three-Dimensional Study of Midfacial Changes Following Le Fort II Distraction With Zygomatic Repositioning in Syndromic Patients. Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning introduced the ability to restore central midfacial height and convexity independent of changes in orbital morphology. This study analyzes midfacial and orbital morphology before and after Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning.All patients who underwent Le Fort II Distraction with zygomatic repositioning between 2013 and 2015 were included. Two- and 3-dimensional measurements were made using 3dMD Vultus software to assess canthal tilt, nasolabial angle, ratio of midfacial to lower facial height, and absolute change in nasal length. Presence of an open bite and Angle classification were assessed before and after surgery.Four patients underwent segmental midface advancement using Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning. Associated diagnoses included Apert syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, and achondroplasia. Changes in facial dimensions included: 3.19  improvement in canthal tilt (range -4.7  to 8.4 ), 9  change in nasolabial angle (range -1.0  to 19 ), and 0.69 cm increase in absolute nasal length (range 0.2-0.94 cm). Mean ratio of midfacial to lower facial height was 0.79 preoperatively and 0.89 postoperatively. Preoperatively, all patients demonstrated Angle class III with 3 of 4 patients demonstrating anterior open bite. All achieved closure of open bite and demonstrated class I or II occlusion. No complications were observed.Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning resulted in normalization of midfacial soft tissue landmarks. This form of advancement demonstrates the ability to selectively improve midfacial height and canthal tilt while restoring normal occlusion.
31895846	Apert Syndrome Management: Changing Treatment Algorithm. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to review 10 years of surgical experience in the management of Apert syndrome, focusing on an updated algorithm which includes hand reconstruction and posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO). Additionally, the authors compare PVDO, which is currently used, with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA), which was utilized in a previous algorithm. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients with Apert syndrome who underwent upper and lower limb reconstruction and craniofacial surgery between 2007 and 2017. A modified Clavien-Dindo surgical complication scale was used to stratify complications between PVDO and FOA. Demographic, surgical, and outcome data was also recorded. The blood transfusion rate between PVDO and FOA was also assessed and compared utilizing the Student t test. RESULTS: The present study included 69 patients with Apert syndrome (34 males and 35 females). Craniofacial surgeries were performed on a total of 38 patients. A total of 210 operations were performed on the respective upper and lower limbs of patients included in this study. A total of 18 patients underwent PVDO (n = 9) and FOA (n = 9). Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis required significantly less transfused blood volume than FOA (P < 0.05). Complication rate and length of hospital stay were similar for each procedure. CONCLUSION: An updated algorithm to treat Apert patients was implemented. Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis incorporated into an updated algorithm results in a lower blood transfusion rate.
22901909	The role of bronchoscopy in the management of patients with severe craniofacial syndromes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of airway anomalies in children with severe craniofacial syndromes and to establish the role of bronchoscopy in the care of these patients. METHODS: Consecutive children with craniofacial syndromes, including both bony deformities of the skull and face, in which a bronchoscopy was performed between 1995 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22 boys, 14 girls; mean age, 39 months) were studied. Craniofacial synostosis was present in 21 patients (Crouzen syndrome, 11; Apert syndrome, 7, Pfeiffer syndrome, 3) and craniofacial dysostosis in 15 (Goldenhart syndrome, 8; Treacher Collins syndrome, 7). In 30 patients (83.3%), bronchoscopy was performed because of respiratory symptoms (apneic episodes, 22; respiratory distress, 13; stridor, 6; cyanosis, 1) and, in the remaining 6 (asymptomatic children), during guided tracheal intubation before a surgical procedure. Airway anomalies were found in 69.4% of patients (70% in symptomatic patients). Management consisted of tracheotomy in 13 patients, adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy in 13, glossopexy in 5, antireflux surgery in 3, and supraglottoplasty in 2. CONCLUSIONS: Airway anomalies occurred in 70% of children with severe craniofacial syndromes and respiratory symptoms. Bronchoscopy should be performed routinely in this selected group of patients, and the entire airway must be examined. Treatment should be tailored to each individual patient.
31137453	Apert Syndrome: Intraoperative and Postoperative Hyponatremia. Apert syndrome is one of the acrocephalosyndactilia syndromes that is characterized with calvarial an extremity deformities. Anesthesia management of this syndrome is commonly related with difficult airway. However, hyponatremia is another insistent complication that can occur during craniosynostosis surgeries. Hyponatremia is a common complication during calvarial remodeling surgeries and it can result in serious neurologic damage. Development of mild hyponatremia in a patient with Apert syndrome that went under craniosynostosis surgery was presented in this study.
28820838	Five-Year Follow-Up of Midface Distraction in Growing Children with Syndromic Craniosynostosis. BACKGROUND: Maxillary position in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis after midface distraction has been shown to be stable 1 year postoperatively. The purpose of this study is to assess midfacial position in the growing child with craniosynostosis 5 years after Le Fort III advancement with a rigid external device. METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients were identified to have the diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis and had undergone midface advancement [corrected]. There were 10 boys and seven girls, seven patients had Crouzon syndrome, five had Apert syndrome, and five had Pfeiffer syndrome. A standard subcranial Le Fort III osteotomy was performed. Cephalometric analysis was performed to assess the position of the maxilla. RESULTS: After device removal, orbitale advanced 13.67 mm along the x axis and downward 1.70 mm along the y axis. The A point advanced 15.97 mm along the x axis and downward 1.14 mm along the y axis. At 1 year after distraction, both orbitale and A point had advanced an additional 0.47 mm and 0.24 mm along the x axis and downward 0.58 mm and 1.78 mm along the y axis, respectively. At 5 years after distraction, the orbitale moved posterior 0.58 mm and the A point advanced an additional 2.08 mm along the x axis. Orbitale and A point descended 3.23 mm and 5.2 mm along the y axis, respectively. CONCLUSION: After Le Fort III advancement with distraction, the maxillary position remains stable and continues to advance minimally along the x axis and demonstrates more growth along the y axis over the long term. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.
23170942	Reconstruction of the hand in Apert syndrome: two case reports and a literature review of updated strategies for diagnosis and management. BACKGROUND: Apert syndrome is a set of complex malformations of the first brachial arch, with manifestations on the skull, face, hands and feet. At the level of the hand, the following signs are always present: complex syndactyly of the second, third and fourth digits with distal bone fusion; simple syndactyly of the fifth digit; foreshortened thumb with radial clinodactily; and symphalangism excluding the fifth digit. METHODS: The digital separation of an Apert hand should begin at 9 months of age and should be completed by 2 to 4 years of age. Our simplified approach consists of early bilateral surgery on border digits followed by unilateral separation of middle syndactily combined with thumb and digit osteotomies and bone grafting as required. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2010 seven patients with Apert syndrome underwent reconstructive surgery of the complex hand syndactyly. The main target in our surgical strategy involved early bilateral separation of border digits, which started between 1 and 2 years of age. The unilateral middle syndactyly mass division with osteotomy of the thumb and other digits and bone grafting (as required) was carried out in later surgeries, which are usually completed by 4 years of age. The evaluation of the results was performed based on the functional results of the hand, morbidity, flap necrosis, skin graft lysis, postoperative range of motion in the small joints, gross grasp, pincer grasp, scar appearance, contractures of digits, and aesthetic outcome. CONCLUSION: As intended, this study proves the need for a complex surgical approach as early as possible with low revision rate, and acceptable functional and aesthetic outcome.
26365357	Perifascial areolar tissue grafting for treating syndactyly with bone fusion in patients with Apert syndrome. Complete syndactyly with bone fusion in patients with Apert syndrome was treated using perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) grafts via a two-stage surgery (i.e. bone separation using inter-bone PAT graft insertion followed by web separation and reconstruction with full-thickness skin grafts). This technique is easy and created nail folds for fingertips.
32398550	Management of Paronychia in Patients With Apert Syndrome. Apert syndrome is a complex congenital syndrome that includes bicoronal craniosynostosis, craniofacial dysmorphologies, cleft palate, hearing loss, spina bifida occulta, cardiac anomalies, and affects the upper and lower extremities-producing complex syndactyly in these patients. Management of the hands yields several challenges and mandates close follow-up to balance repair of complex polysyndactyly with other pressing interventions, such as posterior cranial vault distraction and surgical management of the airway. Our goals of therapy for the hands are to preserve 10 digits, provide sufficient soft tissue coverage, optimize hand function, and minimize the number of surgical interventions. Ideally, surgical management of the hand differences occurs between the ages of 9 months and 2 years, to optimize neurocognitive development. In complex syndactyly observed in patients with Apert syndrome, there are broad, conjoined nail plates that overlie the fused digits, and paronychia occurs frequently. Suppurative infections can delay definitive surgical intervention for the patient's complex syndactyly, and resolution of paronychia is critical. This study aims to propose an effective and safe technique to manage paronychia when it occurs in patients with Apert complex syndactyly and to mitigate the length of delay to definitive polysyndactyly reconstruction. In the context of these patients' need for multiple surgical interventions within the first few years of life, this strategy for preventing or mitigating paronychia can play an important role in streamlining their complex surgical management while avoiding multiple cancellations.
26674912	Management of the Airway in Apert Syndrome. The management of the airway in Apert syndrome is complex and multidisciplinary. This rare syndrome, occurring in up to approximately 1 in 65,000 live births, results in airway compromise at various anatomic levels, in addition to abnormal central respiratory drive. Obstructive apneas arise because of decreased airway caliber, which may occur in the form of congenital bony nasal stenosis, choanal atresia, a deviated nasal septum, a narrowed nasopharynx, a thick long soft palate, lateral palatal swellings, and a tracheal cartilage sleeve. Central apneas in Apert syndrome arise because of raised intracranial pressure and/or Chiari malformations. The purpose of this study was to investigate our treatment methods and outcomes in optimizing the airway in this complex, rare and interesting cohort of patients who present with airway compromise. Patients with Apert syndrome were retrospectively evaluated during a period from 1990 to 2013. Treatments for obstructive apnea were dilatation of nasal airways and choanal atresia repair, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, early midface advancement, and noninvasive ventilation. The insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts, fronto-orbital advancement, and Chiari decompression aid in managing central apneas. The authors present our experience at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, one of the 4 Supraregional Craniofacial Units in the United Kingdom. 
22196295	The Apert hand--angiographic planning of a single-stage, 5-digit release for all classes of deformity. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of computed tomography angiographic planning of a single-stage, complete release of syndactyly in Apert syndrome. METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms were performed as a preoperative planning tool in 6 patients. Five came to surgery. All had a single-stage operation for complete release of their syndactyly. RESULTS: Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The preoperative imaging identified noteworthy abnormalities in vascular anatomy that were incorporated into surgical planning. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.
28570459	Alar Pinning in Rigid External Distraction for Midfacial Hypoplasia. BACKGROUND: Distraction osteogenesis with a rigid external distractor is a widely accepted treatment for midfacial hypoplasia. In this study, the authors introduce the utilization of alar pinning with the external halo distractor for maxillary advancement, in place of an oral splint. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 7 patients who successfully underwent distraction osteogenesis using the alar pinning technique. Midfacial hypoplasia was secondary to Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Apert syndrome (n = 1), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 1), or bacterial meningitis (n = 1). Three patients were managed with monobloc osteotomies, 2 with Le Fort III osteotomies, 1 with Le Fort III osteotomy and frontoorbital advancement, and 1 with Le Fort I osteotomy alone. Patient charts were analyzed for postoperative course and complications relating to the alar pins. RESULTS: Two patients had minor complications specifically related to the alar pins. One patient had concern for a mild skin infection at a pin site that resolved with oral antibiotics. The other patient had loosening of an alar pin, which did not require operative management. Retrospective chart review indicated that all patients were pleased with their results from the distraction, and no patients opted for further advancement. DISCUSSION: Utilization of alar pin sites for external distraction is a feasible and reasonable option for treatment of midfacial hypoplasia involving a Le Fort osteotomy or monobloc procedure. Fixation sites within the alar crease minimize the visibility of pin site scars and eliminate the need for a custom-made oral splint, which prevents usage of the upper dentition and frequently requires consulting a dentist or orthodontist for fabrication. CONCLUSIONS: Alar pinning with an external halo distraction system for management of midfacial hypoplasia has minimal complications and is an alternative to using a custom-made oral splint.
34133757	Complex Airway Management in Patients with Tracheal Cartilaginous Sleeves. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare anomaly characterized by anterior fusion of tracheal cartilages. TCS is associated with syndromic craniosynostoses including Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes and FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1 variants. This study presents a 30-year review of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS and describes diagnostic methods, genetic variants, surgical interventions, and long-term outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution review. METHODS: This review included patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS treated at Seattle Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2020. Tracheostomy, genetic variants, and additional surgery were primary measures. Fisher's exact test compared need for tracheostomy in patients with proposed high-risk (FGFR2 p.W290 or FGFR2 p.C342) versus low-risk genetic variants. RESULTS: Thirty patients with TCS were identified. Average age at diagnosis was 12 months (range 2-weeks to 7.9-years; standard deviation 19.8 months). Syndromes included Pfeiffer (37%), Apert (37%), and Crouzon (26%). Severe obstructive sleep apnea was present in 76% of patients. Tracheostomy was performed in 17 patients (57%); five were successfully decannulated. Additional interventions included adenotonsillectomy (57%), nasal (20%), laryngeal (17%), and craniofacial skeletal surgery (87%). All patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and FGFR2 p.W290C variants and 83% of patients with FGFR2 p.C342 variants required tracheostomy, differing from other variants (P = .02, odds ratio 33, 95% confidence interval 1.56-697.96). One patient (3%) died. CONCLUSION: TCS contributes to multilevel airway obstruction in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. Genetic testing in patients with FGFR2-related syndromic craniosynostoses may identify those at risk of TCS and facilitate early intervention. A better understanding of this patient population may foster individualized airway management strategies and improve outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 132:215-221, 2022.
23702195	Early midfacial distraction for syndromic craniosynostotic patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Syndromic craniosynostosis is known to be associated with various obstructive respiratory disorders, including sleep apnoea. We performed early midfacial distraction in 11 syndromic craniosynostotic patients with obstructive respiratory apnoea and obtained good results. There were four patients with Crouzon syndrome, three patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and four patients with Apert syndrome. Their ages ranged from 7 months to 3 years, 9 months (mean: 2 years, 5 months). Midfacial distraction was performed using an internal or external device to improve obstructive respiratory disorders, such as sleep apnoea, and to avoid tracheostomy. Evaluation was performed by comparison of the pre- and postoperative polysomnograms (PSGs) and cephalograms. All patients had markedly improved respiratory disorders during sleep and avoided tracheostomy. Preoperative PSGs and cephalograms were compared with those from 1 year to 1 year, 6 months postoperatively. The postoperative PSGs and cephalograms showed marked improvements compared with preoperative PSGs and cephalograms. Syndromic craniosynostotic patients have facial bone hypoplasia, particularly of the maxilla. The tongue and parapharyngeal soft tissue become enlarged, and the enlarged tissues can cause airway obstruction. In this study, marked improvements were observed in physical evaluation using PSGs and morphological evaluation using cephalograms. Early midfacial distraction is thought to be a very useful method to reconstruct a large pharyngeal cavity, enlarge the airway, improve obstructive respiratory disorders and to avoid tracheostomy. It is important to select a device suitable for each case when surgery and distraction are performed. 
24820706	Airway statuses and nasopharyngeal airway use for airway obstruction in syndromic craniosynostosis. Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with a high rate of respiratory difficulty, due mainly to midfacial hypoplasia. Nasopharyngeal airway establishment has been reported as the first-line approach to airway obstruction and may obviate the need for a highly invasive tracheotomy. No previous studies have compared airway obstruction status in syndromic craniosynostosis between cases requiring and not requiring airway managements. We focus on nasopharyngeal airway use and airway status outcomes to assess respiratory difficulty in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. A retrospective data analysis of 51 cases with syndromic craniosynostosis was carried out. We divided 30 of the 51 cases with lateral pharyngeal x-rays taken before operations affecting airway diameters into 2 groups, one with neither nasopharyngeal airway insertion nor tracheotomy and the other with one or both of these interventions, and the mean diameters for 8 indices related to the pharyngeal space were compared. Cases with respiratory difficulty due to nasopharyngeal stenosis and requiring airway managements comprised a significantly higher proportion of those with Pfeiffer syndrome than patients with Crouzon or Apert syndrome. Comparative examination of lateral x-ray cephalometry between cases with neither nasopharyngeal airway insertion nor tracheotomy and cases with one or both revealed oropharyngeal diameters tended to be smaller in those with interventions. Cases requiring nasopharyngeal airway insertion were able to continue nasopharyngeal airway use for more than 1 year and a considerable number avoided tracheotomy. It may be worth considering an oropharyngeal-bypass nasopharyngeal airway before performing a tracheotomy. 
26398130	Alternative Methods for Nasotracheal Intubation and Extubation in a Patient With Apert Syndrome. Apert syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, craniosynostosis and syndactyly. Nasotracheal intubation for a patient with Apert syndrome can be a challenge because of abnormal facial anatomy. We experienced the anesthetic management of a patient with Apert syndrome who underwent partial resection of mandible and cleft palate repair with nasotracheal intubation. Nasotracheal intubation using a gastric tube and extubation using an airway exchange catheter proved useful in this case of airway compromise. 
17354380	"[Adult-onset citrullinemia]. Adult-onset citrullinemia (CTLN2) is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by highly increased concentration of citrulline and ammonia in the plasma, which is ascribed to a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), one of the urea cycle enzymes mainly located in the liver. Neurological manifestation in CTLN2 patients closely resemble those of hepatic encephalopathy and in the past, most patients usually followed rapidly deteriorating clinical courses and died of severe brain edema within a few years after onset. However, in 1995 the first CTLN2 patient who was successfully treated by living-related liver transplantation was reported and since then more than 30 patients had underwent this operation in our country, showing good outcomes. No primary defect had not been found within ASS gene locus, but the causative gene of this disorder is now identified as the ""citrin gene"", which might act as a aspartate/glutamate transporter in mitochondria. Different phenotypes are seen in the individuals with a citrin deficiency: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis, juvenile-onset chronic pancreatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis can precede the appearance of CTLN2. The precise pathogenesis of this disease that includes the relationship between the mutations of citrin gene and a deficiency of hepatic ASS activity remains unclear."
19260507	Living donor liver transplantation for type II citrullinemia from a heterozygous donor. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) is a rare disorder of the urea cycle resulting in hyperammonemia, with a poor prognosis. Here we report a 48-year-old Japanese man who showed abnormal nocturnal behavior. Laboratory data indicated raised plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline, and a definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was made by DNA analysis. Hyperammonemia was not improved by oral intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), whereas venous infusion of BCAA was effective. Western blotting revealed heterozygotic expression of citrin protein in a liver biopsy specimen from the patient's brother. However, as symptomatic CTLN2 is very unusual in a heterozygotic carrier, we considered the brother suitable as a living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) donor. The recipient's entire liver was removed, and replaced with the left liver graft. The plasma ammonia level remained low without infusion of BCAA after liver transplantation. From this case we conclude that venous infusion, rather than oral administration, of BCAA is useful for conservative treatment of CTLN2. However, liver transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option for CTLN2, and should be performed before irreversible encephalopathy occurs. Use of a graft from heterozygotic donors is permissible treatment for CTLN2.
20118603	Conventional diet therapy for hyperammonemia is risky in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy associated with citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency caused by SLC25A13 gene mutations develops into adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) presenting with hepatic encephalopathy. Recent studies have suggested that excessive loading of carbohydrates is harmful in citrin-deficient individuals. Here we report a CTLN2 patient who showed further deterioration of encephalopathy after the employment of conventional low-protein diet therapy for chronic liver failure. Owing to the high carbohydrate content, the conventional low-protein diet therapy should be avoided in patients with hepatic encephalopathy associated with citrin deficiency. In addition, our observation may suggest that carbohydrate-restricted diet in which the content of carbohydrate is below 50% of daily energy intake can have therapeutic efficacy in CTLN2 patients.
19285691	A case of adult onset type II citrullinemia with portal-systemic shunt. A 48-year-old woman who had conscious disturbance and abnormal behaviors had been misdiagnosed as having hepatic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia and portal-systemic shunt, and retrograde transvenous obliteration of the shunt did not improve her symptoms. Thereafter, analyses of plasma amino acids and citrin gene revealed a diagnosis of adult onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). She underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) using a left lobe graft from her brother, and her symptoms as well as hyperammonemia improved. Our case demonstrates the importance of CTLN2 as a differential diagnosis in patients with hyperammonemia and consciousness disturbance, even if they present with a portal-systemic shunt.
31898207	Successful treatment of adult-onset type II citrullinemia with a low-carbohydrate diet and L-arginine after DNA analysis produced a definitive diagnosis. A 60-year-old male, who exhibited finger tremors, obnubilation, and hyperammonemia (409 mug/dL), was admitted to our hospital. Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.
27555199	General anesthesia in a patient with citrullinemia using Precedex as an adjunct to prevent delayed emergence. Citrullinemia type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that causes reduced activity of the enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase, which is needed for proper urea metabolism. The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence. 
24182831	Liver transplantation versus conservative treatment for adult-onset type II citrullinemia: our experience and a review of the literature. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, is characterized by increased serum citrulline and ammonia levels. Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression. Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy. The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5% to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver transplantation in the near future.
29651749	Medium-chain triglycerides supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply energy and enhance ammonia detoxification in the hepatocytes of patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia. Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, constitutes the malate-aspartate shuttle, the main NADH-shuttle in the liver. Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.

21204812	A case of adult-onset type II citrullinemia with comorbid epilepsy even after liver transplantation. The current study using single case voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS) explores the neural background of unexplained seizure attacks and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities persisting even after liver transplantation in a patient with adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration. These results are similar to those of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although CTLN2-complicated mesial TLE has rarely been reported. In contrast to TLE, periictal asterixis and interictal slow activities on EEG support another possibility that the patient might have slight metabolic encephalopathy even after the liver transplantation.
25283831	[A case of adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) triggered by an overseas travel]. A 43-year-old male presented with abnormal behavior and consciousness disturbance on the day after traveling abroad and was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed hyperammonemia and hypercitrullinemia. The electro-encephalogram showed frontal dominant bilateral slow delta burst. He had a peculiar taste for nuts. But he didn't take nuts during the overseas travel for 3 days. The family history revealed that his younger brother died of a status epilepticus of unknown cause at the age of 29. These findings were compatible with hepatic encephalopathy due to adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Gene analysis provided a definite diagnosis of CTLN2. Diet and drug therapy have improved his condition. He is due to have liver transplantation which is the only established radical treatment for CTLN2 if his condition becomes worse. The present case shows that cessation of the habitual intake of nuts only for 3 days could lead to onset of CTLN2. 
21921468	[Therapeutic approaches for patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2): effectiveness of treatment with low-carbohydrate diet and sodium pyruvate]. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by highly elevated plasma levels of citrulline and ammonia due to the urea cycle dysfunction associated with citrin deficiency. Patients with CTLN2 show various neurological symptoms with hyperammonemia closely resembling those of hepatic encephalopathy. Since 1990, 26 CTLN2 patients (17 males and 9 females) have been admitted and treated at Shinshu University Hospital. Twelve of the 26 patients received living related partial liver transplantation (LRLT). After LRLT, neurological symptoms soon disappeared, and all patients returned to their previous social lives. Among the 14 patients that did not undergo LRLT, 6 died of intractable encephalopathy or the development of hepatic cancer, but 8 patients have had relatively good clinical courses (follow-up range 0.5-8 years) with oral intake of L-arginine and low-carbohydrate and relatively protein-rich diet. Six patients have been also given sodium pyruvate and the frequency of attacks of encephalopathy markedly decreased in 5 of 6 patients. Our observations indicated that liver transplantation is a very promising type of therapy but that other therapeutic approaches, including low-carbohydrate diet and pyruvate, are being established.
34444641	Impact of Dietary Factors on Brugada Syndrome and Long QT Syndrome. A healthy regime is fundamental for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In inherited channelopathies, such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Long QT syndrome (LQTS), unfortunately, sudden cardiac death could be the first sign for patients affected by these syndromes. Several known factors are used to stratify the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, although none are determinative. The risk factors can be affected by adjusting lifestyle habits, such as a particular diet, impacting the risk of arrhythmogenic events and mortality. To date, the importance of understanding the relationship between diet and inherited channelopathies has been underrated. Therefore, we describe herein the effects of dietary factors on the development of arrhythmia in patients affected by BrS and LQTS. Modifying the diet might not be enough to fully prevent arrhythmias, but it can help lower the risk.
34751355	[Sudden cardiac death during exercise due to Brugada syndrome. Report of one case]. We report a 20-year-old male athlete who while running, presented a sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully rescued by cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers and an automatic external defibrillator. Without evidence of structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed as the cause, after which a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was indicated. We discuss the subject of sudden cardiac death in athletes and its unusual relationship with exercise in this channelopathy.
34182174	Role of endocardial ablation in eliminating an epicardial arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with Brugada syndrome. BACKGROUND: Epicardial ablation is occasionally limited by coronary artery (CA) injuries or epicardial fat (EF). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic obstacles that prevent ablation of epicardial abnormal potentials (EAPs) in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and to investigate the feasibility of EAP elimination by endocardial right ventricular (RV) ablation. METHODS: This study included 16 BrS patients with previous ventricular fibrillation (VF), including 10 with an electrical storm. Data from multidetector computed tomography were assessed, and the proximity of the CA and EF was correlated with EAPs. RESULTS: EAPs were present in the epicardial RV outflow tract and RV inferior wall in all patients and 12 patients (75%), respectively. These EAPs were present within 5 mm of the main body and branches of the right CA in 14 patients (87.5%). However, only 1.4% +- 2.9% of the EAP area was covered with thick EF (>=8 mm). Partial EAP elimination by endocardial RV ablation was feasible in all 10 patients, with 53.3% successful endocardial RV radiofrequency applications for eliminating EAPs. After the procedure, VF remained inducible in 37.5% of the patients. During the 25.1 +- 29.1 months of follow-up, no patients experienced an electrical storm, and VF burden significantly decreased (median VF episodes before and after ablation: 7 and 0, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAPs are near the CA in most BrS patients, thereby requiring caution during epicardial ablation, whereas EF is less of an issue. Endocardial ablation is feasible to eliminate some EAPs and may be combined with epicardial ablation.
34152392	Epicardial origin of cardiac arrhythmias: clinical evidences and pathophysiology. Recent developments in imaging, mapping, and ablation techniques have shown that the epicardial region of the heart is a key player in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmic events in several cardiac diseases, such as Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathy. At the atrial level as well, the epicardial region has emerged as an important determinant of the substrate of atrial fibrillation, pointing to common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Alteration in the gradient of repolarization between myocardial layers favouring the occurrence of re-entry circuits has largely been described. The fibro-fatty infiltration of the subepicardium is another shared substrate between ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Recent data have emphasized the role of the epicardial reactivation in the formation of this arrhythmogenic substrate. There are new evidences supporting this structural remodelling process to be regulated by the recruitment of epicardial progenitor cells that can differentiate into adipocytes or fibroblasts under various stimuli. In addition, immune-inflammatory processes can also contribute to fibrosis of the subepicardial layer. A better understanding of such 'electrical fragility' of the epicardial area will open perspectives for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In this review article, a pathophysiological scheme of epicardial-driven arrhythmias will be proposed.
36960730	Long-Term Outcomes of Brugada Substrate Ablation: A Report from BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Multicenter Registry). BACKGROUND: Treatment options for high-risk Brugada syndrome (BrS) with recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF) are limited. Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. METHODS: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. RESULTS: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2+-0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48+-29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1+-2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003+-0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether it can be an alternative treatment to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation for selected patients with BrS.

34387130	Comparative Effectiveness of Implantable Defibrillators for Asymptomatic Brugada Syndrome: A Decision-Analytic Model. Background Optimal management of asymptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS) with spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern is uncertain. Methods and Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to patient characteristics.
34446272	Ablation in Brugada Syndrome: A Review of Two Cases. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias in patients without structural cardiac alteration. Some patients present repeated episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Epicardial catheter ablation makes it possible to decrease arrhythmic recurrence in these patients.
36396185	Advances in Ventricular Arrhythmia Ablation for Brugada Syndrome. Three decades have passed since the Brugada syndrome (BrS) clinical entity was introduced in the early 1990s. During the first 2 decades, treatment of patients with BrS was challenging because there were limited treatment options, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was the only choice for high-risk patients with BrS, that is, those who had aborted sudden cardiac death or had previous ventricular fibrillation episodes. In this article, the authors focus on these advances and how to treat patients with BrS with catheter ablation.
23289267	[Wilson disease as the significant risk factor of surgical treatment--clinical case report]. Wilson Disease (W ) is a rare inborn disorder of cooper metabolism. In approximately 40% of cases signs and symptoms of abnormal liver functions are observed due to hepatic inflammation, cirrhosis or insufficiency. The mainstay treatment is the conservative treatment with zinc (eg Zincteral) or penicillamine. The Authors present a patient with WD who underwent surgery because of an advanced rectal prolapse (laparotomy, rectal mobilization, rectopexy, the partial sigmoid colon resection with the primary anastomosis). The postoperative course was complicated by anastomotic leakage and a subsequent diffuse peritonitis. The patient required relaparotomy and three weeks treatment in the intensive therapy unit. The Authors consider the WD as a significant risk factor for surgical patients. Surgical treatment of patients with WD should be least invasive.
28433106	Novel perspectives on Wilson disease treatment. Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive copper overload disorder causing hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results with regard to hepatic disease but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years several new therapy options have been developed, showing promising results that might improve the management of Wilson disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens depending on biochemical response pattern seems worthwhile, especially in the decoppering phase of therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option, currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator and appears to be associated with early neurologic deterioration after initiation of therapy to a lower extent than the drugs currently used. Treatment with nonchelating drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is under investigation, but restricted to animal or in vitro studies to date. This includes basic research studies demonstrating proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson disease in order to restore sufficient biliary copper excretion, even before the onset of disease.
32520831	Pediatric Wilson Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) presenting as acute liver failure (ALF) is rare and typically fatal without liver transplantation (LT). Its rarity has hindered comprehensive studies. We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis to characterize a cohort of pediatric patients presenting with ALF whose final diagnosis was WD to examine outcomes and identify predictors of poor outcomes. METHODS: Database searches were conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, restricted to English-language articles published between January 1984 and May 2018. Articles were excluded if pediatric (<18 years old) data were not extractable or if LT was not readily available at reporting institutions. Extracted data included clinical and biochemical characteristics, genotype, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Data were available on 249 subjects from 52 articles, plus 7 additional subjects identified from our institution's WD database (N = 256). Females represented 69% (n = 170/245). Median age at presentation was 13.4 years (n = 204, range 4.0-17.9). Of the total 256 subjects, 87% underwent LT, 11% achieved spontaneous recovery and 2% died before LT. International normalized ratio >2.0 at presentation was a predictor of LT/death (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5-28), with a trend observed for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (odds ratio 4.18, 95% confidence interval 0.99-18). Arithmetic diagnostic scores proved inferior in the pediatric age-bracket compared to adults. CONCLUSIONS: This large international pediatric cohort has permitted an individual patient data analysis of WD presenting as ALF. Notably, 11% of subjects achieved spontaneous survival; the rest required LT. Coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >2:0) and HE at presentation heralded poor outcomes. Further prospective studies may identify additional early predictors of outcomes.
32008504	Effect of Liver Transplant on Neurologic Manifestations and Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Wilson Disease. OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation in various organs (liver, eye, brain) and deteriorates their functions. Symptoms usually appear in the second and third decades of life. Neurologic symptoms and manifestations may appear 2 to 5 years after liver involvement, and neurologic symptoms are usually movement disorders. The main treatment objective is to decrease accumulation of copper by increasing urinary copper excretion. With early diagnosis and treatment, the quality of life of patients with Wilson disease evolves. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of liver transplant on neurologic manifestations and radiologic findings in patients with Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 1988, our center has performed 642 liver transplant procedures. Fifty-three patients with Wilson disease received a liver transplant during this period, with 15 adults patients included in our study. All study patients were evaluated by the same neurologist and radiologist. Tremor was scored by the glass scale test. Radiologic evaluations were made by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Before liver transplant, 4/15 study patients had tremor. In 1 patient, tremor was accompanied by dystonia; the patient's imaging findings and neurologic manifestations had regressed posttransplant. In the other 3 study patients with tremor, tremor decreased without any change in imaging findings. New-onset tremor was seen in 1 patient after liver transplant, but this patient had no observed imaging changes. This situation was correlated with immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic recovery can be achieved in patients with Wilson disease with early diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic findings can be improved after therapy.
26720766	Controversies and Variation in Diagnosing and Treating Children With Wilson Disease: Results of an International Survey. OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.
15915361	[Wilson disease]. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of human copper metabolism that leads to neurological symptoms and hepatic damage of variable degree. The affected gene ATP7B encodes a hepatic copper transport protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are complex with neurologic symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders etc., predominant hepatic disease or mixed forms. Copper deposition in the liver results in acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. Early recognition by means of clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and early initiation of therapy with chelators or zinc-salts are essential for outcome and prognosis. Liver transplantation is an alternative in cases with acute and chronic liver failure and cures the hepatic disease. Frequent monitoring of drug therapy, adverse effects, and compliance is critical for the prognosis of the disease.
27915967	Liver Transplant Can Resolve Severe Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Wilson Disease: A Case Report. Although liver transplant for decompensated cirrhosis secondary to Wilson disease is well accepted, the use of transplant for patients with severe neurologic manifestations of this condition remains controversial, and these can be perceived as a contraindication. Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.
20958917	Long-term follow-up of Wilson disease: natural history, treatment, mutations analysis and phenotypic correlation. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although the long-term survival has yet to be well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WD and to assess those factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence of mutations to the ATP7B gene, the clinical manifestations, treatments and the long-term outcomes were analysed retrospectively in 117 patients with WD (59 men and 58 women, aged at evaluation 38.5 +- 11, range 16-63 years). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a neurological presentation, 51 patients with a hepatic presentation and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for an average of 15.1 +- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with either the hepatic or the neurological presentation (P = 0.099). d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17% respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic, or improved, during the follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the great majority of adequately treated patients with WD and survival coincides with that of the general population.
12760731	D-penicillamine and plasmapheresis in acute liver failure secondary to Wilson's disease. We report a case of a 19-year-old woman with acute liver failure, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, and renal failure as initial manifestations of Wilson disease with recovery following medical treatment. The clinical picture and low serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels gave us a clue to suspect Wilson disease and to initiate plasmapheresis and D-penicillamine soon after admission. The serum and urinary copper levels were elevated with low serum ceruloplasmin. We proceeded to ambulatory follow-up with medical treatment with D-penicillamine. A few months later, during the course of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of symptomatic gallstone disease, a liver biopsy sample was obtained that showed histological liver fibrosis and strongly elevated levels of liver tissue copper.
31113589	Acute Liver Failure due to Wilson Disease: Eight Years of the National Liver Transplant Program in Uruguay. INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Wilson's disease (WD) is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our aim was to describe clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective medical record reviews of all patients with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. RESULTS: WD was the cause of six (15%) of thirty-nine ALF cases. All patients were females, with a mean age of 18 years. Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two with acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 lU/l, 156 IU/L, and 51 IU/L, respectively. Ceruloplasmin levels were low in four patients, urinary cooper was high in four, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemical identifiable copper, and advanced fibrosis on liver histology. The average MELD score was 36. All patients were treated with d-penicillamine and listed for urgent liver transplantation (LT). Prometheus  was performed in one patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after LT. Three patients survived: one without LT (New Wilson Index<11) and two with LT. The referral time to the program and the total time (referral plus waiting list time) were longer for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs. 8 respectively). CONCLUSION: All cases had typical clinical, analytical and histopathology characteristics. Early referral was determinant of prognosis.
28987261	Wilson Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up. Consideration of a diagnosis of Wilson disease is still the critical factor in testing for and establishing disease diagnosis. In association with other clinical and biochemical tests, liver biopsy results and molecular genetic testing can also be used to generate a score for diagnosing Wilson disease. Medical therapy is effective for most patients; liver transplant can rescue those with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver disease who fail to respond to or discontinue medical therapy. Treatment monitoring must be done at regular intervals and includes clinical evaluation, liver tests and blood counts, and copper metabolic parameters.
29449431	Wilson disease: more than meets the eye. Wilson disease is a rare but important disorder of copper metabolism, with a failure to excrete copper appropriately into bile. It is a multisystem condition with presentations across all branches of medicine. Diagnosis can be difficult and requires a high index of suspicion. It should be considered in unexplained liver disease particularly where neuropsychiatric features are also present. Treatments are available for all stages of disease. A particularly important presentation not to overlook is acute liver failure which carries a high mortality risk and may require urgent liver transplantation. Here, we provide an overview of this complex condition.
32291276	Wilson Disease With Novel Compound Heterozygote Mutations in the ATP7B Gene Presenting With Severe Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between ATP7B mutations and diabetes in Wilson disease (WD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 21 exons and exon-intron boundaries of ATP7B were identified by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.525 dupA/ Val176Serfs*28 and c.2930 C>T/ p.Thr977Met) were detected in ATP7B. After d-penicillamine (D-PCA) therapy, serum aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels in this patient were normalized and levels of HbA1c decreased. However, when the patient ceased to use D-PCA due to an itchy skin, serum levels of fasting blood glucose increased. Dimercaptosuccinic acid capsules were prescribed and memory recovered to some extent, which was accompanied by decreased insulin dosage for glucose control by 5 units. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of diabetes caused by WD.
31878905	The study of Wilson disease in pregnancy management. INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy management in women with Wilson disease (WD) remains an important clinical problem. This research was conducted to investigate how to avoid worsening of WD symptoms during pregnancy and increase pregnancy success in women with WD by identifying the best pregnancy management approaches in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 117 pregnancies among 75 women with WD were retrospectively analyzed. Related information of the fetus was also recorded and analyzed. At the same time, regression analysis was performed for data of 22 pregnant women without WD, as normal controls. RESULTS: Of a total of 117 pregnancies among the 75 women with WD and 31 pregnancies among the 22 control womenincluded in this study, there were 108 successful pregnancies and 9 spontaneous abortions. Among the 108 successful pregnancies, 97 women a history of copper chelation therapy before pregnancy; all 97 women stopped anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. The nine women with spontaneous abortion had no pre-pregnancy history of copper displacement therapy. The incidence of lower limb edema was higher in the WD group than in normal controls (P = 0.036). Compared with the control group, there was a higher proportion in the WD group of male infants (P = 0.022) and lower average infant birth weight (t = 3.514, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It is relatively safe for women with WD patients to become pregnant. The best management method for pregnancy in women with WD may be intensive pre-pregnancy copper chelation therapy and no anti-copper treatment during pregnancy.
24118554	Outcome and development of symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation for Wilson disease. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease resulting in hepatic and neurologic dysfunction. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases for patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. AIM: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson disease METHODS: Nineteen patients with Wilson disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five yr after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to the time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. CONCLUSION: Survival after OLT for Wilson disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, substantiating arguments for widening of the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurologic Wilson disease patients with stable liver function.
27350316	Pregnancy outcome after chelation therapy in Wilson disease. Evaluation of the German Embryotox Database. Continuation of treatment is recommended for pregnant women with Wilson disease. Therapy options include the copper chelating agents d-penicillamine and trientine. However, there are still uncertainties concerning a possible teratogenic risk. In this case series, we report on the outcome of 20 pregnancies with maternal chelator exposure at least during the first trimester. Of these 20 pregnancies documented by the German Embryotox Project, 14 were prospectively ascertained and 6 were retrospective. No major birth defects were observed. Three of the 14 prospective cases resulted in a spontaneous abortion, and one pregnancy was electively terminated. Our results do not support the hypothesis of teratogenicity based on earlier case reports of congenital anomalies. Therefore our study may contribute to reassure women needing chelation therapy during pregnancy. However, it must be taken into account that the sample size of this case series is too limited to make final conclusions on teratogenic effects.
33541028	[Advances in the treatment of Wilson Disease]. Wilson Disease is kind of an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are very important for prognosis. This article reviews the treatment of Wilson Disease, focusing on penicillamine, sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and zinc, liver transplantation and gene therapy. At the same time, the problems of medication adherence and follow-up evaluation in patients with Wilson Disease are also discussed.

33369596	Long-Term Urinary Copper Excretion on Chelation Therapy in Children with Wilson Disease. OBJECTIVES: In Wilson disease (WD), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) is recommended to be used for diagnosis. It may be a useful tool to assess the efficacy of treatment during follow-up; however, there are limited data regarding the cutoff value of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the clinical use of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with WD at Kings' College Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The UCE, serum copper, and ceruloplasmin levels, tested during follow-up, were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Over the median duration of 7 years (range 1.4-14.4), 28 patients (age ranged 3.8-17.3 years) had UCE tests during follow-up. Of those, 21 patients had at least one 24-hour UCE test and 7 children had only spot UCE tests. In comparison with the level of 24-hour UCE collected at the first visit after penicillamine challenge test, the median excretion rate was significantly reduced over the follow-up period (P < 0.001), from 26.2 to 8.9 mumol/day following 1-2 years of therapy (P = 0.15), then reduced significantly to 2.2 mumol/day after 3-4 years (P = 0.009), and 5.6 mumol/day at >5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that within 1 year of treatment, the level of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (NCC) drops to <0.8 mumol/L. In the absence of progressive liver disease or signs of copper deficiency, 24-hour UCE decreases to <=8 mumol/day and <6 mumol/day after 1 and 5 years of treatment, respectively.
16996405	Psychological presentations without hepatic involvement in Wilson disease. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of copper metabolism that leads to neurologic symptoms and variable degrees of hepatic damage. The most common characteristic signs clinically are liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurologic disease, or a combination of these. Early recognition by means of clinical signs and an early initiation of therapy using chelators or zinc-salts are essential for a good outcome and prognosis. This report describes a male suffering from Wilson disease who exhibited an unusual presentation that included psychological manifestations without hepatic involvement. He was initially treated for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a seizure disorder until brain imaging established the diagnosis of Wilson disease.
8723326	Wilson disease: genetic basis of copper toxicity and natural history. The discovery that the gene for Wilson disease encodes a copper-transporting ATPase has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and of copper metabolism in humans. The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their location at multiple sites across the genome have limited molecular genetic diagnosis to kindred of known patients, and confirm the necessity for de novo screening by well-proven clinical and biochemical means. It is uncertain whether the variety of specific mutations will account for the wide range of presenting clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely to be important contributing factors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remain effective treatment for most symptomatic hepatic and neurologic Wilson disease. Zinc salts may be used for some asymptomatic patients, and OLT for fulminant hepatitis and patients for whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation for the treatment of neurologic Wilson disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon for treatment of Wilson disease. However, the ability to treat this disorder effectively by this means awaits further characterization of the gene product and more efficient methods for gene delivery to all hepatocytes in the liver.
10378366	[Therapy of Wilson disease]. Wilson disease is a copper storage disease with autosomal-recessive trait that is predominantly a disorder of the adolescent and young adult. Clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of total serum copper, free serum copper and serum ceruloplamin concentrations as well as urinary copper excretion. Confirmation of diagnosis may be achieved by liver biopsy and histological determination of copper content. The aim of treatment is reduction of tissue copper concentration and detoxification of copper. Drugs applied are the chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine, or zinc. The chelating agents induce renal and biliary copper excretion and increased synthesis of metallothionein, which attaches and detoxifies intracellular copper, leading to impaired absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Treatment with zinc results in induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. Regular examinations of the parameters of copper metabolism are necessary in order to control the therapeutic effect. Free copper serum concentrations and urinary copper excretion should reach values below 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. A significant improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of parameters of copper metabolism can be expected earliest six months after onset of therapy. Anti-copper treatment may be accompanied by copper-reduced diet. Lifelong therapy is required and provides life-expectancy near to normal. Interruption of treatment leads to reaccumulation of copper, often resulting in fulminant hepatic failure. This can also be observed as initial presentation in 5% of cases (predominant age 12 to 25 years). End stage liver disease and fulminant hepatic failure are indications for liver transplantation by which the genetic defect is phenotypically cured. Here decoppering treatment is no longer required. Whether severe neurological disorders may also be improved is not clear until today.
19066958	Triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) in children with Wilson disease: experience at King's College Hospital and review of the literature. Our aim was to review our experience of trientine as chelation therapy in children with Wilson disease (WD) and compare to that reported in the literature. We made a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 of 96 (17%) children diagnosed with WD between 1981 and 2006. Children were 6.6 to 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during the penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 were converted from penicillamine to trientine because of reactions to penicillamine: haematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia in three. Trientine was discontinued in three due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five per cent of children presented with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were noticed in eight of 16, Wilson Ferenci score range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. In line with previous reports, trientine was used mainly as secondary treatment when there were severe side effects with penicillamine. Whilst the current evidence is low quality, it appears that trientine is as efficacious as penicillamine and small population studies show a lower side effect profile.
17382611	Wilson disease--a practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Wilson disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive, copper accumulation and toxicity disorder that affects about 30 individuals per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion into bile, leading to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, haemolytic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, reduced levels of serum ceruloplasmin, high concentrations of copper in liver tissues and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson disease can be treated, and early diagnosis is essential: the goal of therapy is to reduce copper accumulation either by enhancing its urinary excretion or by decreasing its intestinal absorption. Medical therapies include penicillamine, trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolibdate. Liver transplantation is a relatively successful treatment option when medical therapy fails or in case of acute liver failure, even though it is also characterized by short- and long-term complications.
36343759	Botulinum toxin type A treatment of four cases of Wilson disease with lower limb dystonia: A prospective study. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been recommended in various neurological disorders as a useful tool for alleviating dystonia. In Wilson disease (WD) patients with dystonia, BoNT-A injection can be used as a treatment modality when conventional treatment is ineffective for alleviating symptoms. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of BoNT-A injection in treating WD complicated by lower extremity dystonia. The efficacy of these injections was assessed by clinical scales, surface electromyography (EMG), and gait analysis. A comparative analysis of all gait parameters, EMG parameters, and clinical scales revealed a significant increase in velocity, decrease in integrated EMG (iEMG), and improvement in modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Burke Fahn Marsden (BFM), and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (all P < 0.05). Overall, our findings indicated that BoNT-A injection led to marked relief of symptoms in patients with WD with lower extremity dystonia.
20946468	Liver transplantation for children with Wilson disease: comparison of outcomes between children and adults. UNLABELLED: Liver transplantation (LT) is lifesaving for patients with Wilson disease (WD) presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (CLD) unresponsive to treatment. AIM: To determine the outcome of LT in pediatric and adult patients with WD. METHODS: United Network for Organ Sharing data on LT from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared for patients requiring LT for FHF and CLD after 2002. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for death and graft loss. RESULTS: Of 90,867 patients transplanted between 1987 and 2008, 170 children and 400 adults had WD. The one- and five-yr patient survival of children was 90.1% and 89% compared to 88.3% and 86% for adults, p = 0.53, 0.34. After 2002, 103 (41 children) were transplanted for FHF and 67 (10 children) for CLD. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in children transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 100%, 100% vs. 90%, 87.5% respectively, p = 0.30, 0.32. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in adults transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 94.7%, 90.1% vs. 90.3%, 89.7%, respectively, p = 0.36, 0.88. Encephalopathy, partial graft, and ventilator use were risk factors for death by logistic regression. CONCLUSION: LT is an excellent treatment option for patients with WD. Patients transplanted for CLD had higher patient survival rates than patients with FHF.
30359967	Plasmapheresis Combined with Continuous Plasma Filtration Adsorption Rescues Severe Acute Liver Failure in Wilson's Disease before Liver Transplantation. Wilsonian crisis (hemolytic crisis and acute liver failure [ALF] in Wilson's disease) is fatal and almost all patients ultimately need a timely liver transplantation to save their lives. How to safely pass the critical period to liver transplantation is still a big challenge to doctors especially to pediatricians facing more difficult situations in blood purification. Here, we report about a 7-year-old child (weight 21 kg) presenting with severe hemolysis and impending ALF that made a rapid recovery with prompt initiation of plasmapheresis combined with continuous plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA) and chelation therapy. Rapidly efficient removal of copper, bilirubin, and albumin-binding toxins by hybrid blood purification alleviated hemolysis and liver injury and successfully bridged the patient over the critical period to late liver transplantation. Moreover, a review of the literature was performed examining the use of plasmapheresis, molecular adsorbent recirculation system, single-pass albumin dialysis, and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration in Wilson disease. The experience of our case points to that plasmapheresis combined with CPFA treatment can improve clinical symptoms and bridge children over through Wilsonian crisis to late live transplantation, and CPFA treatment is feasible and safe in children weighing more than 20 kg.
28433103	Liver transplantation for Wilson disease. Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving and curative treatment for Wilson disease (WD), providing restoration of function of the liver and mitigation of portal hypertension. Indications for LT in patients with WD include acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease not treatable by medical therapy. LT is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma when it develops in patients with WD when tumor resection is not feasible. LT solely for neurologic or psychiatric WD remains controversial. Living liver donation as well as cadaveric orthotopic and auxiliary LT are options for transplantation for WD. Outcomes for LT for WD are excellent, and supportive measures while awaiting transplantation help bridge the patient to a more successful outcome. Future hepatocyte or stem cell transplantation may augment or supplant current LT for WD.
19595231	[Probing into indication of living-related liver transplantation for Wilson's disease]. OBJECTIVE: To probe into indication of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) for Wilson's Disease. METHODS: From January 2001 to February 2007, thirty-seven living-related liver transplants were performed. A retrospective analysis was carried on outcome of those patients. The indications for LRLT were acute hepatic failure in 3 patients and chronic advanced liver disease in 32 patients including 13 patients with Wilsonian neurological manifestations. Two patients presented with severe Wilsonian neurological manifestations even though their liver functions were stable. According to the scoring system for evaluation of the neurological impairment in Wilson disease based on neurological signs and functions (total score was 30), the pre-transplantation score of those patients with neurological manifestations was 15.9 +/- 4.3 (n = 15). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were followed up for 20 - 93 months. The survival rates of post-transplant patients and grafts at 1, 3, and 5 year were 91.9%, 83.8%, 75.7%, and 86.5%, 78.4%, 75.7%, respectively. Postoperative surgical complications occurred in 2 donors with bile leakage required drainage, in 2 recipients with hepatic thrombosis underwent retransplantation of cadaveric liver and in 1 recipient with hepatic stenosis required balloon dilatation. Neurological function was improved in all recipients and the score of posttransplantation at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 month was 17.5 +/- 3.7 (n = 13); 21.0 +/- 4.3 (n = 12); 23.9 +/- 3.9 (n = 10); 26.6 +/- 2.2 (n = 10) and 28.1 +/- 1.9 (n = 7) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute hepatic failure or patients with severe liver disease unresponsive to chelation treatment should be treated with LRLT. Early transplantation in patients with an unsatisfactory response medical treatment may prevent irreversible neurological deterioration even though their liver function is stable.
23109455	Response to different therapeutic approaches in Wilson disease. A long-term follow up study. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are certain areas of uncertainty regarding the best therapeutic approach in patients diagnosed with Wilson Disease (WD). Our aim was to assess treatment response to different therapies in a cohort of WD patients followed in a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study in which clinical, laboratory and imaging data are reviewed in a series of 20 WD patients with a median follow-up of 14 years. Type of presentation, treatment used, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were elicited. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). The initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at diagnosis was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients who were maintained on d-penicillamine for the whole period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; last follow up 38 IU/l). In contrast, patients in whom d-penicillamine was switched to Zn, irrespective of the cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l vs. 66 IU/l at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was found to be effective in most cases regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents, and required switching to zinc. Therapy with zinc was well tolerated and appeared to have a good efficacy. However, in 33%, a complete normalization of liver enzymes was never reached.
15701295	Wilson disease: new insights into pathogenesis, diagnosis, and future therapy. Wilson disease is caused by disease-specific mutations of the copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B. The diagnosis is established by clinical and biochemical means, though advances in molecular diagnostics will someday permit de novo diagnosis. The patient may present with hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms, or a combination of these. Both environmental and extragenic effects contribute to the varied phenotypic presentations of this disease. Patients can be treated effectively with chelating agents or zinc salts, or with liver transplantation. Liver cell transplant and gene therapy offer potential cures for this disorder, but at present only data from preclinical studies on animal models are available. Future advances in immunotolerization and gene therapy will likely enable human trials for treatment of this disorder and other genetic disorders of hepatic metabolism.
32398357	Liver transplantation as a rescue therapy for severe neurologic forms of Wilson disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with Wilson disease (WD) with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active chelation. METHODS: French patients with WD who underwent LT for pure neurologic indication were retrospectively studied. Before LT and at the last follow-up, neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) score, disability with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and hepatic function with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, together with the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring (KFR), brain MRI scores, and copper balance. The survival rate and disability at the last follow-up were the coprimary outcomes; evolution of KFR and brain MRI were the secondary outcomes. Prognosis factors were further assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had LT. All were highly dependent before LT (median mRS score 5). Neurologic symptoms were severe (median UWDRS score 105), dominated by dystonia and parkinsonism. The cumulated survival rate was 88.8% at 1 year and 72.2% at 3 and 5 years. At the last follow-up, 14 patients were alive. Their mRS and UWDRS scores improved (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). Eight patients had a major improvement (78% decrease of the UWDRS score), 4 a moderate one (41% decrease), and 2 a stable status. KFR and brain MRI scores improved (p = 0.0007). Severe sepsis (p = 0.011) and intensive care unit admission (p = 0.001) before LT were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: LT is a rescue therapeutic option that should be carefully discussed in selected patients with neurologic WD resistant to anticopper therapies (chelators or zinc salts) as it might allow patients to gain physical independency with a reasonable risk. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with WD with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active pharmacologic therapy, LT might decrease neurologic impairment.
20955957	Wilson disease. Wilson disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper balance leading to hepatic damage and neurological disturbance of variable degree. The defective gene, ATP7B, encodes a hepatic copper-transporting protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Our knowledge of the genetic basis of Wilson disease has increased dramatically; however, understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and multifarious effects of copper toxicity as basis for targeted and individualised therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations are related to copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain and include hepatic disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disturbances. Mixed presentations occur frequently. Early recognition by means of clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and initiation of therapy with copper chelators, zinc salts or even liver transplantation in cases of acute and chronic liver failure are essential for favourable outcome.
24166573	Acute focal dystonia induced by a tricyclic antidepressant in a patient with Wilson disease: a case report. The authors present the case of a 19-year-old patient with Wilson disease (WD) who developed symptoms of acute focal dystonia of the left hand (a 'starfish' hand presentation) shortly after treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. 
28433104	Wilson disease: symptomatic liver therapy. Wilson disease leads to symptomatic impairment of liver function or liver cirrhosis. Strict adherence to decoppering agents is essential in these patients. Secondary prevention of additional hepatic damage by avoidance of other toxic substances (e.g., alcohol, drugs) and sufficient calorie intake is recommended. Routine examinations in cirrhotic patients include screening for signs of portal hypertension (esophagus varices), development of ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Where varices are present, primary or secondary preventive interventions may include treatment with nonselective beta-blockers or variceal ligation, similar to the approach in patients with liver cirrhosis due to other etiologies. For patients presenting with ascites, diuretics are the treatment of choice. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be diagnosed by paracentesis and should be treated with antibiotics. Liver cirrhosis can also lead to accumulation of neurotoxins causing hepatic encephalopathy. It is characterized by unspecific neuropsychiatric impairment and is treated with laxatives and nonresorbable antibiotics. The best prophylaxis is regular defecation. Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible for bacterial infections of any cause and sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in these patients. In advanced stages of cirrhosis renal function impairment is a common feature. The hepatorenal syndrome shows a high mortality. Where Wilson disease patients have decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation should be evaluated.
17285615	Therapeutic plasmapheresis as a bridge to liver transplantation in fulminant Wilson disease. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to the accumulation of copper mainly in the liver, cornea, brain, and kidney. Rarely, Wilson disease can present as fulminant hepatic failure with direct antiglobulin test-negative hemolytic anemia and renal failure. In the absence of liver transplantation, this disease is uniformly fatal because medical therapy is ineffective. This report describes the successful use of plasmapheresis for a patient with fulminant Wilson disease as a bridge to transplantation. Five daily therapeutic plasmapheresis procedures using fresh frozen plasma as a replacement fluid were performed over 6 days. Serum copper, urinary copper excretion, and hemolysis were significantly reduced and renal function improved. The patient's clinical status improved and she remained clinically stable until a liver transplant was possible. Plasmapheresis can be a successful medical treatment in fulminant Wilson disease and should be considered as a therapeutic measure to stabilize a patient by decreasing serum copper, reducing hemolysis, and helping to prevent renal tubular injury from copper and copper complexes until liver transplantation is possible.
22261259	[Diagnosis and care of Wilson disease with neurological revelation]. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disease that produces a copper accumulation in many organs, initially in the liver, progressing to liver cirrhosis, and in the brain, with different neurologic symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. Different treatments based on chelating agents may help reduce the disease's spontaneous morbidity and mortality. We describe three patients who presented Wilson disease before 18 years of age, with initial neurologic symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparison with literature reports, their clinical symptoms, progression, and care allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm. Neurologic symptoms are present in 35% of the patients with Wilson disease such as dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms. The time to diagnosis remains too long and may account for the increased severity of the illness encountered and problems treating these patients. The first treatment choice must be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. Zinc therapy is the first treatment for asymptomatic patients or those on maintenance treatment. Finally, liver transplantation is a potential treatment even if the patient presents severe neurological disability because it may improve clinical symptoms. However, further research is warranted on this matter.
38695602	Relapse following withdrawal of D-penicillamine from combination (D-penicillamine + zinc) therapy in hepatic Wilson disease. OBJECTIVES: Long-term D-penicillamine (D-pen) therapy in Wilson disease (WD) has numerous adverse effects which advocates its withdrawal, but with an inherent risk of relapse. This prospective observational study was conducted with the objective of evaluating incidence of relapse following withdrawal of D-pen from combination (D-pen + zinc) therapy in maintenance phase of previously symptomatic hepatic WD. METHODS: Hepatic WD patients <18 years of age and on combination therapy for >2 years with 6 months of biochemical remission were included. Biochemical remission was defined as achievement of (i) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), (ii) serum albumin >3.5 g/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) <1.5 and (iii) 24-h urinary copper excretion (UCE) <500 mcg/day, nonceruloplasmin-bound-copper (NCC) <15 mcg/dL. After D-pen withdrawal, monthly liver function test (LFT) and INR and 3 monthly UCE and NCC were done till 1 year or relapse (elevation of AST/ALT/both >2 times ULN or total bilirubin >2 mg/dL), whichever occurred earlier. RESULTS: Forty-five patients enrolled with median combination therapy duration of 36 months. Sixty percent of them had their index presentation as decompensated cirrhosis. Fourteen patients (31.8%) relapsed (cumulative incidence: 4 at 3 months, 11 at 6 months, and 14 at 12 months after D-pen discontinuation). All relapsers had index presentation as decompensated cirrhosis. On Cox-regression, ALT at D-pen withdrawal was an independent predictor of relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.077, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.014-1.145, p = 0.017) with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.860. ALT >=40 U/L predicted risk of relapse with 85.7% sensitivity, 70.9% specificity. CONCLUSION: Incidence of relapse after withdrawal of D-pen from combination therapy is 31.8% in hepatic WD. ALT >=40 U/L, at the time of D-pen stoppage, predicts future relapse.
9544415	Liver transplantation for neuropsychiatric Wilson disease. Although neuropsychiatric manifestations are prominent in some patients with Wilson disease, there is little published information regarding the efficacy of liver transplantation for these patients. A 22-year-old male with advanced neurological impairment and prominent psychiatric manifestations due to Wilson disease who underwent liver transplantation is presented. After transplantation, the ceruloplasmin and copper studies normalized and eventually the Kayser-Fleischer rings disappeared. Neurological recovery was very slow and incomplete, and his behavioural and personality disorder was entirely unaffected. He committed suicide 43 months post-transplantation. A review of the small number of related published cases in the English language literature shows variable neurological recovery post-transplantation, but the course of psychiatric manifestations is virtually never described. This case suggests that one must be cautious regarding liver transplantation for Wilson disease in patients with prior psychiatric manifestations. Aggressive medical management is likely to be preferable in most cases.
28260463	Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Living Liver Transplant for Wilson Disease. Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.
30384011	Chelating principles in Menkes and Wilson diseases: Choosing the right compounds in the right combinations at the right time. Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is primarily found in two genetic diseases of copper transport, Menkes and Wilson diseases, which show symptoms of copper deficiency or overload, respectively. However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency secondary to poor loading of copper-requiring enzymes although sufficient body copper. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, but is deficient in blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to accumulation of copper in several organs most notably brain and liver, and a saturated blood copper pool. It is a challenge to correct copper dyshomeostasis in either disease though copper depletion in Menkes disease is most challenging. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from distinct cells, and we seek to give new angles and guidelines to improve treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson disease combination of a hydrophilic chelator e.g. trientine or dimercaptosuccinate with a brain shuttle e.g. thiomolybdate or lipoate, is discussed. New chelating principles for copper removal or delivery are outlined.
35042319	Wilson disease in children and young adults - State of the art. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the ATP7B gene, with a reported prevalence of 1:30,000-50,000. ATP7B encodes an enzyme called transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, which is essential for copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin and for copper excretion into the bile. A lack or dysfunction of this enzyme results in a progressive accumulation of copper in several organs, especially in the liver, the nervous system, corneas, kidneys, and heart. Children with WD can present with asymptomatic liver disease, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure, with or without neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Approximately 20%-30% of WD patients present with ALF, while most of the other patients have chronic progressive hepatitis or cirrhosis if untreated. Although genetic testing has become a more important diagnostic tool for WD, the diagnosis remains based on both clinical features and laboratory investigations. The aims of treatment are to reduce copper levels and prevent its accumulation in the liver and other organs, especially in the central nervous system. Liver transplantation in WD is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy. For WD patients treated with chelating agents, adherence to the therapy is essential for long-term success. In this review, we also address specific issues in young adults as compared to children.
17461475	Diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure due to Wilson disease. AIM: To describe the diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure due to Wilson disease (WD), which is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: We compared findings of patients presenting with ALF due to WD to those with ALF of other etiologies. RESULTS: Previously described criteria, such as low alkaline phosphatase activity, ratio of low alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin or ratio of high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT), failed to identify patients with ALF due to WD. There were significant differences in low ALT and AST activities (53 +/- 43 vs 1982 +/- 938, P < 0.0001 and 87 +/- 44 vs 2756 +/- 2941, P = 0.037, respectively), low choline esterase activity (1.79 +/- 1.2 vs 4.30 +/- 1.2, P = 0.009), high urine copper concentrations (93.4 +/- 144.0 vs 3.5 +/- 1.8, P = 0.001) and low hemoglobin (7.0 +/- 2.2 vs 12.6 +/- 1.8, P < 0.0001) in patients with ALF caused by WD as compared with other etiologies. Interestingly, 4 of 7 patients with ALF due to WD survived without liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: In ALF, these criteria can help establish a diagnosis of WD. Where applicable, slit-lamp examination for presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and liver biopsy for determination of hepatic copper concentration still remain important for the diagnosis of ALF due to WD. The need for liver transplantation should be evaluated carefully as the prognosis is not necessarily fatal.
22720274	Wilson disease: Canadian perspectives on presentation and outcomes from an adult ambulatory setting. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of WD was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine charts were identified and 11 were excluded on further review. At diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological and six mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (<0.20 g/L) in 94%, and 24 h urinary copper levels high (>0.60 micromol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc the most common at review (65%). Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension, defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reversed portal venous flow on ultrasound or varices/gastropathy on endoscopy was seen in 63%. At last review, 39% had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase levels (>40 U/L). One death and one transplant occurred, while three patients had encephalopathy, two became jaundiced, two developed ascites and one experienced variceal bleed. Of 21 neurological presenting patients, 14 improved compared with baseline, with four making almost complete recovery. Eleven patients experienced documented episodes of neurological decline, including four with non-neurological presentation. Diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging showed basal ganglia (64%), brainstem (64%) abnormalities and atrophy (36%); follow-up showed basal ganglia lesions (50%) and atrophy (55%). CONCLUSION: WD is a diverse chronic disease with generally favourable outcomes for patients who respond to initial therapy, which can be managed predominantly in an ambulatory setting.
33541020	[Research progress in gene therapy for Wilson's disease]. Wilson's disease (WD) is a kind of inherited single-gene autosomal recessive disorder in which mutations in the ATP7B gene cause copper excretion disorders. Drug therapy is currently the main treatment method for WD. Liver transplantation should be considered for poor drug response or acute liver failure. However, it faces problems such as medication adherence, adverse reactions and shortage of liver source. Gene therapy in WD may permanently correct abnormal copper metabolism, which is why it is the focus of current research. This article summarizes the research progress of WD around gene therapy vectors and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.
10604583	Albumin dialysis: effective removal of copper in a patient with fulminant Wilson disease and successful bridging to liver transplantation: a new possibility for the elimination of protein-bound toxins. BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure may be the first manifestation of Wilson disease. If copper elimination fails, liver transplantation is the only remaining therapeutic option. Albumin dialysis, a new method for the removal of protein-bound toxins, was performed in a patient with fulminant Wilson disease. METHODS: An 18-year-old man with Wilson disease presented with hyperacute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy III, oligo-anuric renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis and thrombocytopenia. He was treated with albumin dialysis using a 44 g/l albumin-containing dialysate and a slow dialysate flow rate (1-2 l/h). The other details of the technique used are similar to routine continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration. RESULTS: One hundred and five milligrams of copper were removed by albumin dialysis within the first six treatments, resulting in normalisation of blood-copper levels. Successful treatment of the multiorgan failure was achieved. Hepatic encephalopathy improved within 2 days. The patient initially refused liver transplantation. Therefore 35 additional albumin dialysis treatments were performed. Forty-three grams of bilirubin (an indicator of detoxified substances in the liver) and 196 mg of copper were removed. Multiorgan failure, in particular hepatic encephalopathy, did not recur during 59 days of treatment. Eventually, the patient agreed to liver transplantation and that was successful. CONCLUSION: Albumin dialysis is a new method for the effective treatment of fulminant Wilson disease, resulting in the removal of protein-bound toxins copper and bilirubin. It may serve as a new treatment option in hyperacute liver failure of other origin, acting as an extracorporeal detoxifier.
7878329	[Dermatomyositis and Wilson disease]. A 15 year-old girl developed both a dermatomyositis and a Wilson's disease. A clinical remission was obtained with steroids and D-penicillamine. The potential role of cupric intoxication in the pathogeny of the muscular syndrome is discussed.
32745371	Effect of chelation therapy in pediatric Wilson's disease: Liver and endoscopic outcome. BACKGROUND: As there is paucity of exclusive literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson's disease (WD), this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of chelation on hepatocellular function and portal hypertension in WD. METHODS: Wilson's disease patients with >=9 months of follow-up were evaluated for response to chelation therapy in the following categories: (a) complete remission, (b) partial remission (c) progression of disease; (d) drug toxicity. Pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD), Nazar and New Wilson Index scores were compared. Hemodynamically stable patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (baseline and surveillance) and received prophylaxis (primary or secondary). Endoscopic outcome was assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 111 WD children (aged 9 [3-15] years; PELD score 16 [-11 to 60]), 65 with follow-up of 3.6 (0.8-12) years on chelation (83% D-penicillamine monotherapy, 17% D-penicillamine and zinc) were analyzed. 81% had severe disease at presentation. Favorable outcome (complete and or partial remission), progression of disease and drug toxicity were seen in 71%, 29% and 10.8%, respectively. Two-thirds had esophageal varices which did not show progression. Large esophageal varices (16%) were effectively downgraded in 3 (2-6) therapeutic endoscopic sessions. Nazar score and PELD score at baseline were independent predictors of outcome with favorable correlation with each other (r = .864, P < .001). PELD cutoff 9.45 (AUC: 71%, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 50%; P = .009) and Nazar score cut off 3.5 (AUC: 68%, sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 50%; P = .02) were associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite severe liver disease, the majority of hepatic WD can be managed on D-penicillamine monotherapy. PELD score and Nazar score effectively determine the outcome.
16138673	Botulinum toxin as a novel treatment for self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of the metabolic enzyme hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). This syndrome presents with abnormal metabolic and neurological manifestations including hyperuricemia, mental retardation*, spastic cerebral palsy (CP), dystonia, and self-mutilation. The mechanism behind the severe self-mutilating behavior exhibited by patients with LNS is unknown and remains one of the greatest obstacles in providing care to these patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male child with confirmed LNS who was treated for self-mutilation of his hands, tongue, and lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseters. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in reduced self-abusive behavior in this patient.
9051548	Use of propofol anesthesia during outpatient radiographic imaging studies in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare, x-linked, recessive disorder of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia, spasticity, choreoathetosis, dystonia, self-injurious behavior, and aggression, without significant cognitive impairment. Anesthetic management of inpatients who demonstrate classic manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and require surgical interventions have been described. There are no guidelines in the literature addressing the anesthetic management of the outpatient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Specifically, sudden, unexplained death, abnormalities in respiration, apnea, severe bradycardia, and an increased incidence of vomiting and chronic pulmonary aspiration may preclude this patient population from receiving anesthesia for outpatient procedures. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation was performed for diagnostic, radiographic imaging in 11 outpatients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome using intravenous propofol. A bolus dose of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg propofol was followed by maintenance doses of 60 to 160 mcg/kg/min. Results during and following sedation indicated end-tidal carbon dioxide ranges between 34 mmHg and 59 mmHg. Respiratory rates were never below 10 breaths/min and no partial/complete airway obstruction or labored breathing was clinically evident. Hemodynamics were within 30% of presedation values. No patient demonstrated nausea, vomiting, or pulmonary aspiration. Baseline neuropsychologic status was achieved following sedation, and patients were discharged from the hospital 35 to 90 minutes after sedation was completed. Potential risks and benefits of using propofol in this patient population are discussed.
16530134	Electrophysiological characteristics of limbic and motor globus pallidus internus (GPI) neurons in two cases of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare and debilitating condition characterized by dystonia and self-mutilating behavior. In order to shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia, we report the pallidal electrophysiological activity recorded in two patients during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). METHODS: Microrecordings were performed on 162 neurons along four tracks aimed at the right and left anterior (limbic) and posterior (motor) globus pallidus internus (GPI). RESULTS: Regardless of the anesthetic agent used (propofol or sevoflurane), both patients showed similar neurons firing rates in the four regions studied, namely the limbic and motor portions of the globus pallidus externus (GPE) or GPI. In both patients, firing rates were similar in the GPE (12.2+/-1.8 Hz, N=38) and GPI (13.2+/-1.0 Hz, N=83) portions of the limbic track, while the motor GPE fired at a higher frequency (23.8+/-2.7 Hz, N=18) than the motor GPI (12.5+/-1.4 Hz, N=23). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that light propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia influences pallidal activity in a similar way. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might be characterized by analogous firing frequencies in the limbic GPE and GPI while motor GPE would tend to fire at higher rate than the motor GPI. It is therefore tempting to suggest that the symptoms that are observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might result from motor GPI inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: This observation may confirm the Albin and Delong's model of the basal nuclei in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders.

32573906	Deep Brain Stimulation of the Internal Pallidum in Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome: Clinical Outcomes and Connectivity Analysis. BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. It manifests during infancy with compulsive self-mutilation behavior associated with disabling generalized dystonia and dyskinesia. Clinical management of these patients poses an enormous challenge for medical teams and carers. OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the management of this complex disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team, including imaging, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology evaluations were analyzed with regards to motor and behavioral control, goal achievement, and patient and caregivers' expectations. RESULTS: Four male patients (mean age 13 years) underwent DBS implantation between 2011 and 2018. Three patients received double bilateral DBS electrodes within the posteroventral GPi and the anteromedial GPi, whereas one patient had bilateral electrodes placed in the posteroventral GPi only. Median follow-up was 47.5 months (range 22-98 months). Functional improvement was observed in all patients and discussed in relation to previous reports. Analysis of structural connectivity revealed significant correlation between the involvement of specific cortical regions and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Combined bilateral stimulation of the anteromedial and posteroventral GPi may be considered as an option for managing refractory dystonia and self-harm behavior in LNS patients. A multidisciplinary team-based approach is essential for patient selection and management, to support children and families, to achieve functional improvement and alleviate the overall disease burden for patients and caregivers.
21331772	Urine alkalinization may be enough for the treatment of bilateral renal pelvis stones associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare sex-linked disorder of purine metabolism that is caused by a mutation in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene which causes marked hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, with signs of gouty arthritis and uric acid stone disease in early childhood. We report a case of renal pelvis calculi which was dissolved within 10 days of urine alkalinization and hydration.
36694014	Deep brain stimulation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a systematic review. Given the good results of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of movement disorders, DBS was initially tried to treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) with the aim to alleviate LNS-related dystonia. Some cases have reported clinical results of DBS in LNS thus far. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively summarize cases of LNS treated with DBS and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in LNS. Eight publications covering 12 LNS patients were included in this review. DBS improved dystonia of the LNS to varying degrees. All the included cases achieved partial or complete control of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Overall, DBS is a promising treatment for both motor and behavior disorders of LNS patients, but the results reported thus far have varied widely, especially for motor outcomes. The ultimate clinical benefits in LNS patients were still unpredictable. DBS-related complications were rather common, which raised questions about the safety of the procedure in LNS. More research is needed to further clarify the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.
12593632	Disappearance of self-mutilating behavior in a patient with lesch-nyhan syndrome after bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. Case report. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked hereditary disorder caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Patients with this syndrome are characterized by hyperuricemia, self-mutilation, developmental retardation, and movement disorders such as spasticity and dystonia. The authors performed bilateral chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for control of dystonic movements in a 19-year-old man with LNS. His self-mutilating behavior unexpectedly disappeared after chronic stimulation. This is the first case of LNS that has been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation. The findings indicate that neurobehavioral features of this syndrome are either mediated in the basal ganglia pathways or secondary to the dystonia.
32846834	Delayed emergence from propofol anesthesia in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: A case report. RATIONALE: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder presenting with uric acid overproduction, neurocognitive disability, and behavioral disturbances. Inhalational anesthesia has been frequently used in LNS patients undergoing surgery. Characteristic compulsive self-injurious behavior and high risk of emesis may hinder inhalational induction. Propofol may be beneficial for these patients because of its easy and rapid titration for anesthetic depth during induction, early recovery from anesthesia, and antiemetic effect as well as uricosuric effect. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old male adolescent was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He exhibited poorly controlled muscle, self-injurious behaviors and intellectual disability. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with neurodevelopmental delay in the first year of life, and was diagnosed with LNS, with a substitution of phenylalanine to leucine in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 1 gene on the X-chromosome at 3 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion. OUTCOMES: Time to recovery of consciousness was prolonged after uneventful surgery. Serum uric acid levels gradually increased during postoperative period. LESSONS: Propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion does not provide significant clinical advantages in rapid emergence from anesthesia and management of hyperuricemia in LNS patients undergoing urological surgery.
1523062	Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and xanthine calculi in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. We report a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) with urinary xanthine calculi. At eight years of age calculi in the renal pelvis were successfully disintegrated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) without any complications. Follow-up sonography is very useful for management of patients with LNS, particularly when they are on allopurinol therapy.
29227296	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its variants: examining the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (LNS) is a metabolic disorder involving mutations in the HGPRT1 gene that result in hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, a dystonic movement disorder, and compulsive self-injury with self-mutilation. The aim of this review is to summarize recent research that documents the extended behavioral, neurologic, and neurocognitive phenotype in classic LNS, to describe milder variants of HGprt deficiency that do not self-injure and have less severe neurological and cognitive deficits, and to provide an update on treatment for associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Psychiatric management utilizes combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment in conjunction with protective equipment and dental management to avert self-injury. Pharmacological management focuses on stabilization of mood and anxiety management. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a physiological intermediate in methylation and transsulfuration, has shown beneficial effects in carefully selected patients who can tolerate the drug. Deep brain stimulation is shown in several case reports and series to reduce or eliminate self-injury and aggression, and in some cases, modify dystonia. SUMMARY: This review highlights progress in our understanding of the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HGprt deficiency) and its variants, describes psychiatric and behavioral management, and discusses prospects for new therapies.
17853483	Antero-ventral internal pallidum stimulation improves behavioral disorders in Lesch-Nyhan disease. The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, a purine salvage enzyme. Affected individuals exhibit a characteristic neurobehavioral disorder with delayed acquisition of motor skills, dystonia, severe self-mutilations, and aggressive behavior. Deep brain stimulation has been previously proposed for controlling isolated involuntary movements and psychiatric disorders. We applied a double bilateral simultaneous stimulation to limbic and motor internal pallidum in one patient for controlling both behavioral and movement disorders, respectively. The injurious compulsions disappeared; dystonia and dyskinesia were decreased at 28 months follow-up.
21940691	Pallidal deep-brain stimulation associated with complete remission of self-injurious behaviors in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a case report. The purpose of this case report is to review the management of a boy with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with deep-brain stimulation who had remission of self-injurious behaviors as a result. This patient was treated with intrathecal baclofen and, later, with deep-brain stimulation to reduce hypertonia. Goals were to improve wheelchair positioning for school attendance and to reduce the use of restraints for comfort. Intrathecal baclofen was implanted twice and decreased the hypertonia, but both were explanted because of infection. Deep-brain stimulation was initiated 2.5 years ago, and since that time, comfort and function have improved and caregiver burden has decreased. Improvements in dystonia with deep-brain stimulation have also occurred, and self-injurious behaviors have resolved.
13677952	[A patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome complicated by tracheobronchomalacia and fatal bleeding from tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula]. A 19-year-old man with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), had dyspnea and an inspiratory wheeze, and underwent assisted mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia of the cresent moon type. He lost his weight, and his general condition gradually worsened. Four months post-tracheostomy, he died of massive hemoptysis from a tracheobrachicephalic artery fistula. Many patients with LNS have renal failure and pneumonitis, whereas occasional cases are complicated by convulsions, recurrent coma, abnormalities of respiration, and sudden death. The etiology of sudden death is not clear. Although tracheomalacia, to our knowledge, has not been described in the literature, it may be a clinical feature of LNS associated with abnormal respiration and sudden death. Tracheobrachiocephalic artery fistula is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders and a chronic tracheostomy tube. Caution is required in LNS patients with opisthotonic extensor spasms of the neck and trunk, chronic bronchitis, and malnutrition.
18520986	Botulinum toxin: treatment of self-mutilation in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder involving purine metabolism caused by the congenital absence of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. A characteristic feature of LNS is the appearance of intractable self-injurious behavior, usually in the form of severe lip and finger biting. The mechanism behind this severe self-mutilating behavior is unknown, and is one of the main challenges in the management of this condition. We here report the case of a 30-year-old man with a confirmed diagnosis of LNS who was successfully treated for self-mutilation of his lips with repeated botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the facial perioral muscles. Our findings suggest that treatment with BTX-A helped reduce self-abusive behavior in this patient. Our case illustrates that BTX-A injections can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with self-abusive behavior.
22350962	Successful unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a chronic, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder causing motor and behavioral dysfunction due to decreased synthesis of the enzyme hypoxantine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Affected boys have mental retardation, delayed development, extrapyramidal motor disturbances and self-injuring behavior. As hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be effective in several neurodevelopmental inborn errors, we hypothesized that it could be favorable in LNS as well. Following a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulphan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days with ATG Thymoglobin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days) an unrelated umbilical cord blood unit was transfused at the age of 2 years. The graft was a 6/6 HLA-matched at HLA-A, B loci by antigen level, and at DRB1 by allelic level typing. Infused total nucleated cell dose was 3.6 x 10e7 per kilogram body weight. Serum HPRT levels reached normal values by the end of the sixth month post transplant. Slow neurodevelopmental improvement seen during the three-year follow-up and the missing self-injuring behavior can be considered as a proof for the presence of enzyme-competent cells behind the blood-brain barrier.
31985336	Late diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan disease complicated with end-stage renal disease and tophi burst: a case report. Background: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of purine metabolism. Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia.Case report: A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment.Conclusion: In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.
17595035	Opposite effects of internal globus pallidus stimulation on pallidal neurones activity. Besides clinical efficacy, the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation (DBS) are still debated. To shed light on this complex issue, we have taken the opportunity to record the response of globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurones to 100 Hz stimulations in a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) where four pallidal electrodes were implanted. Three types of response were observed, 2/19 neurones were unaffected by DBS. About 7/19 neurones were inhibited during DBS stimulation and 10/19 neurones were excited during DBS stimulation. Both effects ceased when DBS was turned off. Inhibited neurones were situated lower that exited ones on the trajectory (1.25 and 4.65 mm above the center of GPi respectively). These observations suggest that locally DBS induces a reversible inhibition of neurone firing rate while at the same time distantly exciting the main afferents to and/or efferents from the GPi. Both actions would result in a strong GPi inhibition that does not preclude increased outflow from the GPi.
28330516	Treatment of severe refractory valvar pulmonary stenosis with primary transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation. Some patients with pulmonary valve stenosis do not respond to balloon valvuloplasty and must undergo surgical repair. We report the case of a 12-year-old child with pulmonary valve stenosis and Noonan syndrome in whom we performed transcatheter Melody pulmonary valve implantation after balloon dilation failed. The result was excellent. This technique can be proposed as an alternative to surgery in such cases.
29109363	Efficacy and safety of two doses of Norditropin  (somatropin) in short stature due to Noonan syndrome: a 2-year randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in Japanese patients. This randomized double-blind multicenter trial (NCT01927861) evaluated the growth-promoting effect and safety of Norditropin  (NN220; somatropin) in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome. Prepubertal children aged 3-<11 years (boys) or 3-<10 years (girls) with Noonan syndrome were randomized to receive GH 0.033 mg/kg/day (n = 25, mean age 6.57 years, 11 females) or 0.066 mg/kg/day (n = 26, mean age 6.06 years, eight females) for 104 weeks. Change in height standard deviation score (HSDS) from baseline was analyzed based on an ANCOVA model. Baseline HSDS was -3.24. Estimated change in HSDS [95% CI] after 104 weeks' treatment was 0.84 [0.66, 1.02] and 1.47 [1.29, 1.64] for the lower and higher doses, respectively; estimated mean difference 0.63 [0.38, 0.88], p < 0.0001. Rates and patterns of adverse events (AEs) were similar between groups. Most were mild and reported as unlikely to be related to Norditropin . There were no withdrawals due to AEs. Insulin-like growth factor-I SDS increased from -1.71 to -0.64 (0.033 mg/kg/day) and to 0.63 (0.066 mg/kg/day). HbA1c increased slightly (0.033 mg/kg/day: +0.14%; 0.066 mg/kg/day: +0.13%); glucose profiles were almost unchanged; insulin profiles increased in both groups in the oral glucose tolerance test. There were no clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiography findings. We conclude that Norditropin  at doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day or 0.066 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks increases height in Japanese children with short stature due to Noonan syndrome, with a favorable safety profile. The effect was greater with 0.066 mg/kg/day compared with 0.033 mg/kg/day.

10206464	Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of two cases. Two boys with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome in whom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed are described. Both patients demonstrated B-lineage leukemias with normal cytogenetics. They were treated with combination chemotherapy and remain in remission off therapy. Patients with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome may be at increased risk for ALL.
12147971	Combined catheter-based pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect closure in Noonan syndrome. A case report and literature review. The first case of combined procedure of catheter-based balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect closure using Amplatzer Septal Occluder, in a patient with Noonan syndrome, is reported. The literature regarding prevalence, genetics, pattern of involvement, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of this syndrome is reviewed.
28192847	[Gastroparesis in Noonan syndrome]. We present a case of a 26-year-old female patient with bloating, postprandial nausea and recurrent vomiting after solid food intake. A gastric emptying scintigraphy showed a delayed gastric emptying, defining gastroparesis. Because of her past medical history of short stature and pulmonary stenosis, we initiated genetic counseling where the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome was made. Dietary therapy and medication with domperidone quickly led to relief of the discomfort due to gastroparesis. However, prokinetics are not indicated for long-term therapy, as cardiac arrhythmia may occur. A risk-benefit assessment should be done. There are several novel approaches which need to be further investigated.
16078230	Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia in a child with Noonan syndrome and clonal duplication of the germline PTPN11 mutation. A 4-year-old girl with Noonan syndrome (NS) and constitutive PTPN11 mutation presented with stage 4 neuroblastoma and was treated by intensive chemotherapy. During the treatment, cytogenetic analysis revealed the development of a hyperdiploid clone with duplication of the germline PTPN11 mutation in a morphologically normal bone marrow. A few months later, the patient developed acute myelomonoblastic leukemia with an additional clonal deletion of 7q. Although, we cannot conclude whether there is an association between NS and neuroblastoma, this case suggests that duplication of germline PTPN11 mutations, potentially induced by chemotherapy, contributes to leukemogenesis in patients with NS.
30576779	Early Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery in Patients with Noonan Syndrome. There is a paucity of cardiac surgery outcomes data for patients with Noonan syndrome (NS). Our objective was to evaluate early results in these patients. Between January 1999 and December 2015, 29 patients (18 males, 62%) with NS underwent cardiac surgery at our institution. Mean age was 23 +- 17.9 years; 12 (41%) were under 18 years of age. Fourteen patients (48%) had prior sternotomies. The primary operations for the main diagnosis were pulmonary valve/conduit replacement/repair (n = 14, 48%), septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7, 24%), aortic valve replacement/repair (n = 4, 14%), atrial septal defect (ASD) repair (n = 2, 7%), and cardiac transplantation (n = 2, 7%). Concomitant procedures were performed in 24 patients (83%), most commonly right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (n = 13, 45%), mitral valve repair/replacement (n = 7, 24%), and ASD repair (n = 6, 21%). Mean bypass and cross-clamp times were 88.8 +- 51 minutes and 54.7 +- 67 minutes, respectively. There was 1 early death (3%). Postoperative morbidity occurred in 18 patients (62%), most commonly arrhythmias (n = 14, 48%) or respiratory insufficiency/pneumonia (n = 6, 21%). There were 2 early reoperations and 4 early readmissions. Univariate factors associated with morbidity included male gender (P = 0.03) and longer cross-clamp time (P = 0.02). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (interquartile range 5-10.5 days). Patients with NS frequently have multiple cardiac lesions requiring a broad spectrum of operations. Early mortality is low despite procedure complexity. Although early postoperative morbidity is common, patients overall do well with reasonable hospital lengths of stay. Additional studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes and quality of life.
16636503	Hemodynamic consequences of a swinging, infarcted ventricular septum. Noonan syndrome presents with dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and cardiac abnormalities (most commonly pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This report describes a rare case accompanied by a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal aneurysm causing right ventricular (RV) pressure gradient. A 29-year-old mentally retarded man was admitted to hospital with exertional dyspnea. His somatic features included short stature (148 cm), hypertelorism, a shield chest, and thoracic scoliosis. Echocardiogram showed a secundum ASD with bidirectional shunting and a ventricular septum bulging toward the left ventricle in diastole, and then toward the RV in systole causing obliteration of the RV. The peak pressure gradient measured across the RV outflow by continuous wave Doppler was 30 mmHg. Cardiac catheterization revealed an elevated RV pressure without pulmonary hypertension and confirmed the pressure gradient. Right ventriculography revealed the septal excursion toward the RV in systole, leaving only a small residual cavity in the inflow and outflow regions of the RV. The ASD was closed with an autologous pericardial patch. A thin, fibrous portion of the ventricular septum was resected and replaced with a Dacron patch. From the histological examination, the RV cavity obliteration turned out to be produced by the excursion of the infarcted ventricular septum.
20306897	Percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty and atrial septal defect closure in a 69-year-old patient with Noonan's syndrome. We present the case of a patient with Noonan syndrome who was seen for the first time at the age of 69 years with combined pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect. The patient was treated by a staged percutaneous approach. The treatment of these combined congenital heart defects remains challenging because their haemodynamics interact directly. In this case report we discuss both the underlying pathophysiology and haemodynamics.
15889278	A novel mutation in the PTPN11 gene in a patient with Noonan syndrome and rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. UNLABELLED: A male infant with clinical features of Noonan syndrome and rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is reported. He manifested severe heart failure and failure to thrive. Administration of propranolol and cibenzoline improved ventricular outflow tract obstruction, leading to catch-up growth. Genetic analysis of the patient revealed a novel missense mutation in the PTPN11 gene. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a patient with a Gln510Glu mutation in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 gene. This specific mutation may be associated with a rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
7500608	[Pulmonary lymphangiectasis with spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome]. We report a case of Noonan syndrome associated with pulmonary stenosis and major lymphedema of the lower extremities. At the age of 15 yr spontaneous chylothorax with increasing dyspnea occurred> Chest-x-ray demonstrated increased interstitial markings restricted to the right lower lobe representing pulmonary lymphangiectasia. The chylothorax did not respond to repeated thoracocentesis and medium-chain-triglyceride diet. When a chest tube was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was supplied, the chylous effusion decreased within 32 days. The patient is still on diet and asymptomatic effusion remained during 12 months follow up. In conclusion, pulmonary lympgangiectasia should be considered in patients with Noonan syndrome and an abnormal interstitial pulmonary pattern similar to pulmonary congestion (without any hemodynamic abnormalities). In case of pleural effusion, chylothorax should be considered.
1456257	Spontaneous chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. Treatment with prednisone. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of spontaneous chylothorax in a child with Noonan syndrome successfully treated with prednisone. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A pediatric cardiology referral center for the Rocky Mountain region. PATIENT: An 18-month-old girl with Noonan's syndrome, pulmonary stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who presented with spontaneous chylothorax. INTERVENTIONS: The child's chylothorax did not respond to thoracic duct ligation, tetracycline pleurodesis, and pleurectomy during a 2-month period. A low-fat diet was helpful but did not eliminate the problem. Prednisone was started orally at 1 mg/kg per dose twice daily and slowly tapered during 3 months. The chylothorax did not recur during 8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prednisone may be useful in the treatment of chylothorax in Noonan syndrome. A controlled clinical trial would be helpful but would be difficult in such a rare complication of an uncommon syndrome.
10668781	Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in a patient with Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease occurring with an incidence of 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 live births, is characterized by its particular cardiovascular abnormalities, including pulmonic valve stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, and, more rarely, septal defects and coarctation of the aorta. The case of a 20-year-old man admitted for inpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after pulmonic valve repair, left pulmonary artery angioplasty, and pectus excavatum repair is presented. His endurance was markedly decreased, thus limiting his ability to perform activities of daily living and reducing his exercise tolerance. With participation in a comprehensive cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program, he experienced marked improvement with independence in his activities of daily living and an increase in his metabolic equivalent levels from to 2.8 to 5.4. After inpatient rehabilitation, he underwent left pulmonary stent placement before being discharged home. Subsequent outpatient cardiopulmonary rehabilitation has continued to improve significantly his overall exercise tolerance. Given that Noonan syndrome is viewed as the most common syndrome associated with congenital heart disease after Down syndrome, physiatrists must be familiar with its presentation, its associated abnormalities, and the treatment approach to optimize the patient's cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and psychological status.
27565148	Impaired synaptic plasticity in RASopathies: a mini-review. Synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) is considered to be the neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory. Impairments are discussed to be one of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental disorders. In so-called RASopathies [e.g., neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)], neurocognitive impairments are frequent and are affected by components of the RAS pathway which lead to impairments in synaptic plasticity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive method to investigate synaptic plasticity in humans. Here, we review studies using TMS to evaluate synaptic plasticity in patients with RASopathies. Patients with NF1 and Noonan syndrome (NS) showed reduced cortical LTP-like synaptic plasticity. In contrast, increased LTP-like synaptic plasticity has been shown in Costello syndrome. Notably, lovastatin normalized impaired LTP-like plasticity and increased intracortical inhibition in patients with NF1. TMS has been shown to be a safe and efficient method to investigate synaptic plasticity and intracortical inhibition in patients with RASopathies. Deeper insights in impairments of synaptic plasticity in RASopathies could help to develop new options for the therapy of learning deficits in these patients.
11316696	Short stature in Noonan syndrome: response to growth hormone therapy. BACKGROUND: Growth hormone (GH) has been used to promote growth in both the short and long term in a number of dysmorphic syndromes, including Turner syndrome. As this condition shares many clinical features with Noonan syndrome, it would seem logical to treat the latter group with GH. AIMS: To assess the short and long term response to GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome. METHODS: Analysis of patients with Noonan syndrome in the Pharmacia & Upjohn International Growth Study (this post-marketing database contains data on the majority of patients currently treated with GH in the UK). A questionnaire was also sent to participating clinicians. RESULTS: Data on 66 patients (54 males) were available for study. At the start of GH therapy children were short, compared with both normal and Noonan children. During the first year of GH therapy height velocity increased from a mean of 4.9 to 7.2 cm per year. For patients treated long term with GH, mean height SDS increased from -2.9 pretreatment to -2.6 after one year and -2.3 after five years. Of the 10 patients at near final height, only one had a height above the 3rd centile for normal adults and above the mean for untreated Noonan patients. The mean increment in final height was 3.1 cm (range -1.1 to 6.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome will improve height velocity in the short term. Longer-term therapy results in a waning of effect; initial indications are that final height is not improved substantially in most patients.
34363648	Disseminated lymphangiomas as a cutaneous manifestation of Noonan syndrome. Lymphangioma is a known, but rare manifestation of Noonan syndrome. We present the case of disseminated and circumscribed cutaneous lymphangiomas in the context of Noonan syndrome. Oral rapamycin is a promising treatment in these extensive and morbidity-causing cases.
8992869	Cardiovascular abnormalities in Noonan syndrome: the clinical findings and treatments. The clinical findings and treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities in 33 patients with Noonan syndrome are reviewed. Major cardiovascular abnormalities were pulmonary valvular stenosis in 17 patients (51.1%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 11 (33.3%), and atrial septal defect in 9 (27.3%). Dysplastic pulmonary valve was seen in 6 (35.3%). Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed for 4 patients with dysplastic pulmonary valves. Two patients were successfully treated. Surgical treatment was performed in 13 patients, 11 alive and 2 died. Two patients with HCM and arrhythmia died suddenly. In conclusion, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty should be the initial palliation for dysplastic pulmonary valve in Noonan syndrome, and HCM is the risk factor for sudden death in Noonan syndrome.
34446079	Dietary treatment of congenital chylothorax with skimmed breast milk. BACKGROUND: Congenital chylothorax (CC) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in newborns. It is defined as an accumulation of chyle in the pleural cavity. The few publications regarding medical management and therapeutic dietary intervention motivated us to share our experience. METHODS: Neonates diagnosed with congenital chylothorax and treated at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital between 2013 and 2020 (n = 6, gestational age: 36 3/7, 32 5/7, 36 4/7, 35 0/7, 35 4/7, 37 3/7 weeks) were eligible for this report. The cornerstones of treatment for chylothorax conventionally consist of chest tube drainage (CTD), respiratory support, dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides (LCT) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). In further course the introduction of a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-based formula followed by an overlapping switch to a formula with low LCT and high MCT, containing the essential long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), is attempted. In three patients we used fat-modified (skimmed) breast milk to provide a high protein and low fat diet and to avoid the discontinuation of breast milk. RESULTS: The outcome of an early introduction of LCFA in the form of skimmed breast milk after resolution of chylothorax diverse. One patient had a favourable outcome, meaning no recurrence of pleural effusion, adequate weight gain and a content mother, while another patient had a relapse of pleural effusion after the administration of skimmed milk and was therefore transitioned back to Basic F  . The CC of patient 5 was difficult due to Noonan syndrome. Two weeks after the introduction of skimmed breast milk the mother wanted to stop to express breast milk, so nutrition was changed to Basic F . CONCLUSION: The first-line therapy of chylothorax is a combination of respiratory stabilization and dietary modification. The use of skimmed breast milk is advisable in CC and feasible by means of a simple milk defatting procedure. It offers benefits to mothers who wish to resume breast feeding after resolution of chylothorax and has proven positive effects, above all in preterm infants as optimal nutrition with protective components superior to formula feeding. However, the nutritional analysis of the skimmed milk and the correlation to a re-accumulation of pleural fluid remains a question to be answered.
17028394	[Clinical symptoms and molecular pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome--current concepts]. Noonan syndrome (NS; MIM 163950) is an autosomal dominant disorder. With incidence of 1/1000 to 1/2500 live births, NS belongs to the most common genetic disorders. Typical features of NS are: short stature, chest deformities, congenital heart defects, cryptorchidism and dysmorphic features. Mutations of PTPN11 gene (located on chromosome 12q24.1) are responsible for NS and are identified in 33-60% cases. Less than half of the cases are familial. This paper presents current opinion on clinical symptoms, molecular pathogenesis and possibilities of growth hormone therapy. The genotype--phenotype correlation is also discussed.
30382642	[General Anesthesia for Septal Myectomy in a Patient with Noonan Syndrome, Severe Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction]. We report a case of an 18-year-old man with Noonan syndrome, severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomy- opathy and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction who underwent septal myectomy under general anes- thesia. In our case, the ventricular outflow tract pres- sure gradients were 108 mmHg at left and 79 mmHg at right. General anesthesia was induced deliberately by fentanyl, midazolam and sevoflurane. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. For treatment of hypotension, we performed volume loading and admin- istration of phenylephrine. We did not use drugs that increase heart rate or contractility. Preload and after- load were well maintained, and the operation and gen- eral anesthesia were completed without serious prob- lem.
38309657	Congenital ectropion in Noonan syndrome. Ten-year-old female patient, with facial dysmorphia, scoliosis, short stature, muscular hypotonia, patent foramen ovale and maturational delay, presented for correction of bilateral congenital ectropion. Ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral lower eyelid ectropion, euryblepharon and lagophthalmos, with a positive Bell's phenomenon. She was treated with full-thickness autologous skin grafts on the lower eyelids with bilateral lateral canthoplasty, resolving the ectropion and improving eyelid occlusion. Subsequently, a genetic study was performed that revealed a mutation in the PTPN11 gene and allowed, together with the clinical picture, to make the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome is a multisystem genetic disorder with a wide variety of phenotypes, which usually presents with ocular and periocular disorders. Eyelid ectropion, a distinctive feature of this patient, is a rare ophthalmological manifestation of this syndrome that can be corrected with full-thickness skin graft and lateral canthoplasty.
12679651	Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma in Noonan syndrome. The incidence of various benign and malignant tumors is increased in patients with Noonan syndrome compared with the general population. We present a 9-year-old boy with the typical features of Noonan syndrome and an acute nonaxial proptosis of the right eye. An ultrasound scan, a computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging raised suspicion of rhabdomyosarcoma. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The tumor was consequently treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare but important differential diagnosis of tumor formation in children with Noonan syndrome and may arise in the orbit.
19927903	Genetic evaluation and management of fetal chylothorax: review and insights from a case of Noonan syndrome. Fetal chylothorax is one of a very few syndromes that can be treated in utero with thoracoamniotic shunting or pleurodesis by OK-432 as two major therapeutic modalities. We report on a fetus with Noonan syndrome and a missense mutation c.182A > C (p.Asp61Ala) of PTPN11 who responded poorly to antenatal pleurodesis by OK-432. Based on our previous publication and this case study, we propose that fetal chylothorax of a distinct genetic origin may respond poorly to OK-432 pleurodesis.
25480460	Congenital chylothorax: a prospective nationwide epidemiological study in Germany. BACKGROUND: Congenital chylothorax (CCT) is a rare disease of unknown aetiology. Treatment approaches vary; none has been evaluated prospectively. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine incidence, treatment and outcome of infants with CCT born in Germany in 2012. DESIGN: CCT was defined as non-traumatic chylous pleural effusion within 28 days after birth. As part of the Surveillance Unit for Rare Pediatric Conditions in Germany (Erhebungseinheit fur seltene padiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland), all paediatric departments (n=432) received monthly reporting cards to notify the study centre of CCT cases, which were analysed based on anonymised questionnaires and discharge summaries. Data are shown as median (range) or n/N. RESULTS: Of 37 cases reported, 28 met inclusion criteria. Questionnaires and/or discharge summaries were available for 27/28. Assuming complete reporting, the incidence of CCT was 1:24 000. Nine infants suffered from proven or suspected syndromal anomalies, most frequently Noonan syndrome (5/9). Postnatally, 23 required mechanical ventilation, 3 continuous positive airway pressure; only 1 had no respiratory support. 17 infants were treated with inotropes/vasopressors, 25 required pleural drainage for 11 (1-36) days. In 13 infants, enteral feeds were withheld initially; 25 received medium-chain triglyceride diet at some time, 9 were treated with octreotide or somatostatin. 18 infants survived without, 6 with sequelae attributable to the underlying disorder; 3 infants died (median age at death 37 (2-144) days). Duration of hospital stay in survivors was 51 (20-127) days. Infants treated with octreotide or somatostatin had similar outcomes compared with those not treated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this small observational study, CCT seems to have a favourable prognosis if not associated with genetic disorders.
25894171	Fatal outcome after renal transplant in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome is a congenital, common, hereditary disorder. Facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, and various heart defects are typical clinical features. In patients with minor cardiac pathology, life expectancy is normal. We report a case of renal transplant in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome that ended with death of the patient. Our patient presented with unexpected and refractory postoperative neurological complications that were unresponsive to intensive therapy, and the patient died because of secondary complications. 
35810017	Kidney Transplantation in a Patient With Noonan Syndrome: A Case Report. Noonan syndrome (NS) is a congenital genetic abnormality characterized by short stature, delayed onset of puberty, cardiac malformations, and characteristic external malformations. Congenital chromosomal or genetic abnormalities are sometimes associated with carcinomas. Furthermore, they are difficult to manage perioperatively because of multiple complications and mental retardation. The safety of kidney transplantation for patients with NS has not been established. We are reporting the case of a 31-year-old man with NS who received a kidney transplantation after a donor's brain death. He received kidney transplantation safely and was discharged without issues. Kidney transplantation for patients with congenital chromosomal or genetic abnormalities is feasible without serious complications, with a regular follow-up, and psychological support from patients and families.
29092974	Breast reconstruction in a patient with Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern affecting 1 in 1000-2500 births. Patients with this syndrome present with characteristic facial, musculoskeletal, cardiac and endocrine abnormalities. Lack of postpubertal breast development is a common manifestation of this syndrome and may result in severe hypomastia and a masculine appearance of the female chest. We report the first case of breast reconstruction in a 24-year-old woman with NS who lacked postpubertal breast development. Technical considerations for addressing the existing chest wall deformity, implant pocket selection as well as emphasis on the role of the plastic surgeon are presented.
12359141	Exacerbation of the ochronosis of alkaptonuria due to renal insufficiency and improvement after renal transplantation. In alkaptonuria, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase deficiency causes tissue accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA), followed by signs and symptoms of ochronosis. These include massive urinary excretion of HGA, arthritis and joint destruction, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissue, and cardiac valve deterioration. We describe a 46-year-old man with alkaptonuria and diabetic renal failure whose plasma HGA concentration was twice that of any other alkaptonuria patient, and whose ochronosis progressed much more rapidly than that of his two alkaptonuric siblings. After renal transplantation, the plasma HGA normalized, and the daily urinary excretion of HGA decreased by 2-3g. This case illustrates the critical role of renal tubular secretion in eliminating HGA from the body, and suggests that renal transplantation in a uremic patient not only restores HGA excretion, but may also provide homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity for the metabolism of HGA.
32822600	Efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for patients with alkaptonuria (SONIA 2): an international, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria is a rare, genetic, multisystem disease characterised by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. METHODS: SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99 7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0 003 [95% CI 0 003 to 0 004], p<0 0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference -8 6 points [-16 0 to -1 2], p=0 023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical signs, indicating a slower disease progression. FUNDING: European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.
25475116	Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1): an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study to investigate the effect of once daily nitisinone on 24-h urinary homogentisic acid excretion in patients with alkaptonuria after 4 weeks of treatment. BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a serious genetic disease characterised by premature spondyloarthropathy. Homogentisate-lowering therapy is being investigated for AKU. Nitisinone decreases homogentisic acid (HGA) in AKU but the dose-response relationship has not been previously studied. METHODS: Suitability Of Nitisinone In Alkaptonuria 1 (SONIA 1) was an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, no-treatment controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of different doses of nitisinone once daily on 24-h urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) in patients with AKU after 4 weeks of treatment. Forty patients were randomised into five groups of eight patients each, with groups receiving no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg of nitisinone. FINDINGS: A clear dose-response relationship was observed between nitisinone and the urinary excretion of HGA. At 4 weeks, the adjusted geometric mean u-HGA24 was 31.53 mmol, 3.26 mmol, 1.44 mmol, 0.57 mmol and 0.15 mmol for the no treatment or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg doses, respectively. For the most efficacious dose, 8 mg daily, this corresponds to a mean reduction of u-HGA24 of 98.8% compared with baseline. An increase in tyrosine levels was seen at all doses but the dose-response relationship was less clear than the effect on HGA. Despite tyrosinaemia, there were no safety concerns and no serious adverse events were reported over the 4 weeks of nitisinone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with AKU, nitisinone therapy decreased urinary HGA excretion to low levels in a dose-dependent manner and was well tolerated within the studied dose range. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EudraCT number: 2012-005340-24. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCTO1828463.
12546396	Alkaptonuria and lumbar disc herniation. Report of three cases. Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and characterized by bluish-black discoloration of cartilages and skin (ochronosis). The authors report the cases of three patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent discectomy and in whom the nucleus pulposus was discovered to be black. Alkaptonuria was diagnosed after discectomy. Discal herniation requiring surgery is unusual in alkaptonuria, with only a few reports. The symptoms in the three patients disappeared after surgery and no symptoms were demonstrated on follow-up examination.
19671401	[Intrahepatic gallstones in patient with alkaptonuria]. Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited disease with enzyme deficiency in the protein metabolism. The patients accumulate homogentisic acid which leads to symptoms from various body tissues. We describe a patient with recurrent intrahepatic gallstones probably due to such accumulation, and the successful treatment with removal of the stones and a low-protein diet.
10488288	Alkaptonuric aortic stenosis: a case report. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.
9870204	The success of dietary protein restriction in alkaptonuria patients is age-dependent. Alkaptonuria is characterized by an increased urinary excretion of homogentisic acid, pigmentation of cartilage and connective tissues, and ultimately the development of inflammatory arthropathy. Various diets low in protein have been designed to decrease homogentisic acid excretion and to prevent the ochronotic pigmentation and arthritic lesions. However, limited information is available on the long-term beneficial effects of these diets. We reviewed the medical records of 16 patients aged 3-27 years (4 > 18 years) to ascertain the age of diagnosis, growth, development, social behaviour, signs of complications and longitudinal dietary compliance. The diagnosis of alkaptonuria was made at an average age of 1.4 years (2 months-4 years); following the diagnosis all patients were prescribed a diet with a protein content of 1.5 g/kg per day. All patients showed normal growth and development, and no major complications of the disease. Behavioural problems associated with poor dietary compliance emerged as the main problem. Dietary compliance decreased progressively with age. The effect of dietary protein restriction in homogentisic acid excretion was studied by fixing the amounts of protein in the diet at 1 g/kg per day and 3.5-5 g/kg per day during 8 days. Twelve patients, aged 4-27 years, participated in the investigation. Protein restriction resulted in a significantly lower excretion of homogentisic acid in the urine of children younger than 12 years (p < 0.01), whereas this effect was less obvious for adolescent and adult patients. The results suggest that restriction of protein intake may have a beneficial effect on alkaptonuric children; but continuation of this regimen to older age seems questionable and not practical.
28081634	The effect of nitisinone on homogentisic acid and tyrosine: a two-year survey of patients attending the National Alkaptonuria Centre, Liverpool. Background Alkaptonuria is a rare, debilitating autosomal recessive disorder affecting tyrosine metabolism. Deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leads to increased homogentisic acid which is deposited as ochronotic pigment. Clinical sequelae include severe early onset osteoarthritis, increased renal and prostate stone formation and cardiac complications. Treatment has been largely based on analgaesia and arthroplasty. The National Alkaptonuria Centre in Liverpool has been using 2 mg nitisinone (NTBC) off-license for all patients in the United Kingdom with alkaptonuria and monitoring the tyrosine metabolite profiles. Methods Patients with confirmed alkaptonuria are commenced on 2 mg dose (alternative days) of NTBC for three months with daily dose thereafter. Metabolite measurement by LC-MS/MS is performed at baseline, day 4, three-months, six-months and one-year post-commencing NTBC. Thereafter, monitoring and clinical assessments are performed annually. Results Urine homogentisic acid concentration decreased from a mean baseline 20,557 micromol/24 h (95th percentile confidence interval 18,446-22,669 micromol/24 h) by on average 95.4% by six months, 94.8% at one year and 94.1% at two year monitoring. A concurrent reduction in serum homogentisic acid concentration of 83.2% compared to baseline was also measured. Serum tyrosine increased from normal adult reference interval to a mean +- SD of 594 +- 184 micromol /L at year-two monitoring with an increased urinary excretion from 103 +- 81 micromol /24 h at baseline to 1071 +- 726 micromol /24 h two years from therapy. Conclusions The data presented represent the first longitudinal survey of NTBC use in an NHS service setting and demonstrate the sustained effect of NTBC on the tyrosine metabolite profile.
22772574	T1 hyperintense disc in alkaptonuria. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of alkaptonuria presenting as a T1-hyperintense disc herniation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A 46-year-old man without previous diagnosis of alkaptonuria underwent evaluation for progressive back pain revealing a T1-hyperintense disc herniation at the L3-L4 level. Discectomy recovered a blackened disc that was pathologically confirmed to be nucleus pulposus with alkaptonuric involvement. The differential diagnosis of a T1-hyperintense, T2-hypointense disc on magnetic resonance imaging is discussed, with emphasis on the pathophysiology of alkaptonuria. METHODS: A single patient is reported. RESULTS: Pathologically proven patient presentation with radiological and pathological images. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of alkaptonuria presenting as a T1-hyperintense disc herniation.
19300282	Devastating ochronotic arthropathy with successful bilateral hip and knee arthroplasties. Ochronotic arthropathy is a manifestation of long-standing alkaptonuria, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by the absence of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. We describe a patient who developed rapidly progressive destructive ochronotic arthropathy in his knee and hip joints and underwent successful bilateral total knee and hip arthroplasties.
10494297	[A child with dark discoloration of urine]. In a 3-year-old boy alkaptonuria was diagnosed. From early age on gradual dark discoloration of his urine had been noticed in the diapers, but routine urinalysis had not revealed abnormalities. Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disease in which homogentisic acid cannot be metabolised, due to a lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The disease often manifests itself in childhood by darkening of urine on standing. The excretion of homogentisic acid in urine in these patients is increased. The disease leads to serious consequences, such as ochronosis of cartilage and connective tissues with arthritis. It is expected that treatment with ascorbic acid and a dietary restriction of protein (1 g/kg/day) can decrease the late and serious consequences by diminishing the serum concentration of the metabolite benzoquinone acetic acid.
16736091	Ochronosis and lumbar disc herniation. Alkaptonuria is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which the homogentisic acid oxidase activity is absent. Its incidence is as low as 0.001%. Ochronosis is the pigmentation of connective tissues and this pigmentation leads to degenerative changes in alkaptonuric patients. Alkaptonuria most prominently involves the lumbar region, but lumbar disc herniation as the presenting feature of alkaptonuria is not common. Only a few patients required surgical intervention. Herewith we report an alkaptonuric patient, who was operated on for lumbar disc herniation. His discectomy material was black and the metabolic disorder was diagnosed retrospectively. This metabolic disease is often recognized on physical re-examination after the black disc material was seen during the operation. Therefore urinalysis for homogentisic acid should be performed in all patients with degenerative changes of the vertebral column. The results of disc surgery in this patient group is successful.
22482092	Ochronotic arthropathy: diagnosis and management: a critical review. Alkaptonuria, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder, is characterized by accumulation of homogentisic acid in the connective tissues resulting from lack of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. Ochronosis, dark pigmentation of connective tissues, is the musculoskeletal manifestation of alkaptonuria. In this article, we report the case of a 53-year-old man who had ochronotic arthropathy and advanced degenerative changes in the shoulders managed with bilateral total shoulder arthroplasty. Three-year follow-up results were satisfactory: good range of motion, no pain, and no signs of prosthesis loosening. Shoulder function was significantly improved after surgery, as documented by Constant scores. This case suggests that shoulder prosthesis results are not affected by alkaptonuria.
24793526	Prevention of retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome: the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol. PURPOSE: The Stickler syndromes are the most common causes of inherited and childhood retinal detachment; however, no consensus exists regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic intervention. We evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol, a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected. Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a 10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type 1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.
32316871	Ocular complications and prophylactic strategies in Stickler syndrome: a systematic literature review. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagenopathy caused by mutations in the genes COL2A1 (STL1) or COL11A1 (STL2). Affected patients manifest ocular, auditory, articular, and craniofacial manifestations in varying degrees. Ocular symptoms include myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, and glaucoma. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of ocular manifestations and the outcome of prophylactic treatment on reducing the risk of retinal detachment. METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Information on the cross-study prevalence of myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma, visual impairment, severity and age of onset of myopia and retinal detachments. Studies that reported on the outcome of prophylactic treatment against a control group were explored. RESULTS: 37 articles with 2324 individual patients were included. Myopia was found in 83% of patients, mostly of a moderate to severe degree. Retinal detachments occurred in 45% of patients. Generally, the first detachment occurred in the second decade of life in STL1 patients and later in STL2. Cataracts were more common in STL2 patients, 59% versus 36% in STL1. Glaucoma (10%) and visual impairment (blind: 6%; vision loss in one eye: 10%) were rare. Three studies reported on the effect of prophylactic treatment being protective. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations are common in Stickler patients, but the comparison between studies was difficult because of inconsistencies in diagnostic and inclusion criteria by different studies. Sight-threatening complications such as retinal detachments are common but although prophylactic therapy is reported to be effective in retrospective studies, evidence from randomized trials is missing.
17138163	"Difficulties in anesthetic management of patients with micrognathia: report of a patient with Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder with characteristic midface hypoplasia, retromicrognathia, cleft palate and a ""moon-shaped"" appearance. Progressive myopia and retinal degeneration are frequent. It is estimated that one third of all Pierre Robin patients have Stickler syndrome. Patients with a mandibular hypoplasia like Stickler syndrome present the anesthesiologist considerable problems when mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation is attempted. In this case report the difficulties in anesthetic management of patients with micrognathia and repeated anesthetic courses of a child with Stickler syndrome are presented. It is vital to detect the syndrome in early stages so that adequate counseling and treatment may be given to avoid the potentially irreversible and disabling consequences."
8544588	Airway obstruction in the Pierre Robin sequence. Airway obstruction and feeding difficulties vary among patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). Treatment is challenging and the appropriate management may not be readily identified, leading to delay in securing the airway. A retrospective review of 90 children with PRS was done to identify subgroups at a higher risk of developing severe airway obstruction using oxygen and apnea monitoring, sleep studies, and response to treatment. Patients with isolated PRS (group I, 27 patients) and Stickler syndrome (group II, 32 patients) do not suffer from debilitating airway and feeding difficulties when compared to those with unique syndromes (group III, 16 patients) and recognized named syndromes (group IV, 15 patients). Feeding difficulties were universal with the severity proportional to airway obstruction. Aggressive intervention should be considered early in group III and IV patients.
21466760	The clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic retinal interventions to reduce the risk of retinal detachment and subsequent vision loss in adults and children with Stickler syndrome: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

31856005	Stickler Syndrome: Airway Complications in a Case Series of 502 Patients. BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.
20545219	[Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment]. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by various disorders of the eyes and the connective tissues throughout the body. It can arise from a mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.
32536504	Surgical management in a severe OSA patient diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder of connective tissue. One of the major symptoms associated with this disorder is an oro-facial malformation, which may cause a submucous cleft or a complete cleft of the hard palate. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Stickler syndrome and a submucosal cleft palate (SMCP) visited our hospital with a chief complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and administration of a polysomnography test revealed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.9 events/hour (h). Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure was initiated to control the OSA symptoms and subsequently the patient showed some improvement. However, due to continuous velopharyngeal insufficiency symptoms, intravelar veloplasty was performed. Three months after surgery, the AHI had decreased to 12.4 events/h. Recent studies have described a greater risk for OSA in individuals with cleft palate, than in the general population. The present case demonstrates surgical success in a patient with OSA and SMCP, suggesting that palatal surgery may be considered an optional surgical treatment for OSA patients with SMCP.
26540157	Use of External Distractors and the Role of Imaging Prior to Mandibular Distraction in Infants With Isolated Pierre Robin Sequence and Stickler Syndrome. IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
9091366	Prophylactic laser photocoagulation in Stickler syndrome. The ocular manifestations in a family with Stickler syndrome and the results of laser photocoagulation as preventive treatment for retinal detachment are described. Forty-two family members with Stickler syndrome were retrospectively reviewed; 22 had ocular abnormalities, 22 had myopia and 16 had high myopia. Ten patients had developed retinal detachment and 9 of them were blind in one or both eyes because of irreparable detachment. Only 2 eyes had been operated on successfully. Ten eyes were lasered prophylactically. In eyes with extensive vitreoretinopathy laser burns were applied 360 degrees around the peripheral retina at the border between the pathological and normal retina. Eyes with isolated lesions received focal treatment around the pathological areas. Four eyes received 360 degrees laser photocoagulation and 6 eyes received focal treatment. Of the treated cases, 9 retinas remained attached for a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 15 years. One patient was lost to follow-up, and 5 years later developed retinal detachment in one eye from a new non-lasered lesion. In conclusion, in this particular family the incidence of retinal detachment was significantly higher in non-lasered eyes than in lasered eyes (p < 0.025).
