A particularly severe subgroup first described in 1894, and subsequently called Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, is characterized by progressive pontobulbar palsy, sensorineural hearing loss and respiratory insufficiency. There has been no treatment for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which leads to respiratory failure and usually death during childhood. We recently reported the identification of SLC52A2, encoding riboflavin transporter RFVT2, as a new causative gene for Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. We used both exome and Sanger sequencing to identify SLC52A2 mutations in patients presenting with cranial neuropathies and sensorimotor neuropathy with or without respiratory insufficiency. We undertook clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical characterization of patients with mutations in SLC52A2, functionally analysed the most prevalent mutations and initiated a regimen of high-dose oral riboflavin. We identified 18 patients from 13 families with compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in SLC52A2. Affected individuals share a core phenotype of rapidly progressive axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (manifesting with sensory ataxia, severe weakness of the upper limbs and axial muscles with distinctly preserved strength of the lower limbs), hearing loss, optic atrophy and respiratory insufficiency. We demonstrate that SLC52A2 mutations cause reduced riboflavin uptake and reduced riboflavin transporter protein expression, and we report the response to high-dose oral riboflavin therapy in patients with SLC52A2 mutations, including significant and sustained clinical and biochemical improvements in two patients and preliminary clinical response data in 13 patients with associated biochemical improvements in 10 patients. The clinical and biochemical responses of this SLC52A2-specific cohort suggest that riboflavin supplementation can ameliorate the progression of this neurodegenerative condition, particularly when initiated soon after the onset of symptoms.

Our data suggest, however, that the clinical spectrum of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase deficiency is much broader than has been reported in the literature. Sequencing of the PNPO gene was undertaken for a cohort of 82 individuals who had shown a reduction in frequency and severity of seizures in response to pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Novel sequence changes were studied using a new cell-free expression system and a mass spectrometry-based assay for pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase. Three groups of patients with PNPO mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified: (i) patients with neonatal onset seizures responding to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (n = 6); (ii) a patient with infantile spasms (onset 5 months) responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (n = 1); and (iii) patients with seizures starting under 3 months of age responding to pyridoxine (n = 8). Data suggest that certain genotypes (R225H/C and D33V) are more likely to result in seizures that to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. Other mutations seem to be associated with infertility, miscarriage and prematurity. However, the situation is clearly complex with the same combination of mutations being seen in patients who responded and did not respond to pyridoxine. It is possible that pyridoxine responsiveness in PNPO deficiency is affected by prematurity and age at the time of the therapeutic trial. Other additional factors that are likely to influence treatment response and outcome include riboflavin status and how well the foetus has been supplied with vitamin B6 by the mother. For some patients there was a worsening of symptoms on changing from pyridoxine to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Many of the mutations in PNPO affected residues involved in binding flavin mononucleotide or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and many of them showed residual enzyme activity. One sequence change (R116Q), predicted to affect flavin mononucleotide binding and binding of the two PNPO dimers, and with high residual activity was found in Groups (ii) and (iii). This sequence change has been reported in the 1000 Genomes project suggesting it could be a polymorphism but alternatively it could be a common mutation, perhaps responsible for the susceptibility locus for genetic generalized epilepsy on 17q21.32 (close to rs72823592). We believe the reduction in PNPO activity and B6-responsive epilepsy in the patients reported here indicates that it contributes to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical related donor is the treatment of choice in patients with this disease. However, fewer than 20% of patients have a disease-free HLA-identical sibling. BMT from HLA-nonidentical related donors has previously met with poor results, with graft rejection a major obstacle in all cases. We describe BMTs from HLA-nonidentical related donors (n = 13) and from a matched unrelated donor (n = 1) performed in two centers in 14 consecutive cases of FHL. Remission of disease was achieved before BMT in 10 patients. Marrow was T-cell-depleted to minimize graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antiadhesion antibodies specific for the alpha chain of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, CD11a) and the CD2 molecules were infused pre-BMT and post-BMT to help prevent graft rejection, in addition to a conditioning regimen of busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide (CP), and etoposide (VP16) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Sustained engraftment was obtained in 11 of 17 transplants (3 patients had 2 transplants) and disease-free survival in 9 patients with a follow-up period of 8 to 69 months (mean, 33). Acute GVHD greater than stage I was not observed, and 1 patient had mild cutaneous chronic GVHD that resolved. Toxicity due to the BMT procedure was low. Results obtained using this protocol are promising in terms of engraftment and event-free survival within the limitations of the small sample. We conclude that an immunologic approach in terms of drugs used to obtain disease remission and a conditioning regimen that includes antiadhesion molecules in T-cell-depleted BMT from HLA genetically nonidentical donors is an alternative treatment that warrants further study in FHL patients who lack a suitable HLA genetically identical donor.

Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the beta-globin gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent beta-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, both affecting functional beta-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient's own HSPCs, broadening access to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for beta-thalassemia (Zynteglo ). This review illuminates the beta-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the beta-globin locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.

The patient was born at term of healthy consanguineous parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy. On the 2nd day of life she refused oral feeding, became tachydyspnoeic and showed excessive weight loss. Laboratory studies showed metabolic acidosis, marked lactic acidaemia, hyperammonaemia and increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 3-methylcrotonylglycine, 3-hydroxpropionic acid and methylcitric acid. Peritoneal dialysis combined with oral supplementation of biotin (10 mg/day) started on the 3rd day of life resulted in rapid clinical recovery and normalisation of biochemical parameters. HCS deficiency was established in lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. The activities of all biotin-dependent carboxylases were severely decreased in fibroblasts grown in medium with moderate biotin concentration (10(-8) mol/l) but normal in a high biotin medium (10(-5) mol/l). Mitochondrial carboxylase activities in lymphocytes were 23%-29% of mean normal during therapy with 20 mg of biotin/day, with the higher dose of 40 mg/day they were within (3-methylcrotoryl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase) or slightly below (propionyl-CoA carboxylase) the normal range. At the age of 3 years the patient's physical and psychomotor development are normal. Early biotin supplementation should be considered in newborns with lactic acidosis and organoaciduria until a final diagnosis has been established. Furthermore, the required individual dose of biotin has to be carefully evaluated biochemically for the individual patient.

However, after trauma or surgery, excessive fibrinolysis may contribute to coagulopathy, bleeding, and inflammatory responses. Antifibrinolytic agents are increasingly used to reduce bleeding, allogeneic blood administration, and adverse clinical outcomes. Tranexamic acid is the agent most extensively studied and used in most countries. This review will explore the role of fibrinolysis as a pathologic mechanism, review the different pharmacologic agents used to inhibit fibrinolysis, and focus on the role of tranexamic acid as a therapeutic agent to reduce bleeding in patients after surgery and trauma.

A distinctive clinical disorder.The disorder of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy has recently been identified, and is now delineated in detail. A phenotypically homogeneous group of five families from Australia, Britain and Canada, containing 47 affected individuals, was studied. The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning six generations. This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures, with hyperkinetic or tonic manifestations. Subjects often experienced an aura, and remained aware throughout the attacks. Seizures occurred in clusters (mean eight attacks/night) typically as the individual dozed, or shortly before awakening. The epilepsy usually began in childhood, and persisted through adult life, with considerable intra-family variation in severity. Seizures were often misdiagnosed as benign nocturnal parasomnias, psychiatric and medical disorders. Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful. Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks were partial seizures with frontal lobe seizure semiology. Neuro-imaging was normal. Carbamazepine monotherapy was frequently effective. This disorder showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis, appropriate therapy and genetic counselling. Moreover, this disorder now offers an opportunity to identify a gene for partial epilepsy.

15474813		Primary viscocanalostomy versus trabeculectomy for primary open-angle glaucoma: three-year prospective randomized clinical trial.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial, 50 eyes of 50 patients with medically uncontrolled POAG were randomized to have a trabeculectomy (25 eyes) or a viscocanalostomy (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively. RESULTS: At 3 years, the mean IOP was 16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07 (SD) in the trabeculectomy group and 17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (IOP 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and 55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Qualified success (IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients. However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.

Here, we present biochemical, functional, and natural history data from 50 individuals homozygous for a pathogenic ST3GAL5 c.862C>T founder allele (median age 8.1, range 0.7-30.5 years). GM3 and its derivatives were undetectable in plasma. Weight and head circumference were normal at birth and mean Apgar scores were 7.7 +- 2.0 (1 min) and 8.9 +- 0.5 (5 min). Somatic growth failure, progressive microcephaly, global developmental delay, visual inattentiveness, and dyskinetic movements developed within a few months of life. Infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy was characterized by a slow, disorganized, high-voltage background, poor state transitions, absent posterior rhythm, and spike trains from multiple independent cortical foci; >90% of electrographic seizures were clinically silent. Hearing loss affected cochlea and central auditory pathways and 76% of children tested failed the newborn hearing screen. Development stagnated early in life; only 13 (26%) patients sat independently (median age 30 months), three (6%) learned to crawl, and none achieved reciprocal communication. Incessant irritability, often accompanied by insomnia, began during infancy and contributed to high parental stress. Despite catastrophic neurological dysfunction, neuroimaging showed only subtle or no destructive changes into late childhood and hospitalizations were surprisingly rare (0.2 per patient per year). Median survival was 23.5 years. Our observations corroborate findings from transgenic mice which indicate that gangliosides might have a limited role in embryonic neurodevelopment but become vital for postnatal brain growth and function. These results have critical implications for the design and implementation of ganglioside restitution therapies.

Patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 utilizing supportive care, which focuses on symptom management, never sit unassisted, and 75% die or require permanent ventilation by age 13.6 months. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma, formerly AVXS-101) is a gene replacement therapy comprising an adeno-associated viral vector containing the human SMN gene under control of the chicken beta-actin promoter. This therapy addresses the genetic root cause of the disease by increasing functional SMN protein in motor neurons and preventing neuronal cell death, resulting in improved neuronal and muscular function as previously demonstrated in transgenic animal models. In an open-label, one-arm, dose-escalation phase 1 trial, systemic administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec via a one-time infusion over one hour demonstrated improved motor function and survival in all infants symptomatic for spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Of the 12 patients who received the proposed therapeutic dose, 11 achieved independent sitting, two achieved independent standing, and two are able to walk. Most of these 12 patients remained free of respiratory supportive care. The only treatment-related adverse event observed was transient asymptomatic transaminasemia that resolved with a short course of prednisolone treatment. This review discusses the biological rationale underlying gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, describes the onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trial experience, and provides expert recommendations as a reference for the real-world use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in clinical practice. As of May 24, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved onasemnogene abeparvovec, the first gene therapy approved to treat children younger than two years with spinal muscular atrophy.

METHODS: The coding region of GDAP1 was screened for the presence of mutations in seven families with AR CMT in which the patients were homozygous for markers of the CMT4A locus at chromosome 8q21.1. RESULTS: A nonsense mutation was detected in exon 5 (c.581C>G, S194X), a 1-bp deletion in exon 6 (c.786delG, G262fsX284), and a missense mutation in exon 6 (c.844C>T, R282C). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in GDAP1 are a frequent cause of AR CMT. They result in an early-onset, severe clinical phenotype. The range of nerve conduction velocities (NCV) is variable. Some patients have normal or near normal NCV, suggesting an axonal neuropathy, whereas others have severely slowed NCV compatible with demyelination. The peripheral nerve biopsy findings are equally variable and show features of demyelination and axonal degeneration.

Studies suggest that with regard to slowing aortic-root enlargement, losartan may be more effective than beta-blockers, the current standard therapy in most centers. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial comparing losartan with atenolol in children and young adults with Marfan's syndrome. The primary outcome was the rate of aortic-root enlargement, expressed as the change in the maximum aortic-root-diameter z score indexed to body-surface area (hereafter, aortic-root z score) over a 3-year period. Secondary outcomes included the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic root; the rate of change in aortic regurgitation; the time to aortic dissection, aortic-root surgery, or death; somatic growth; and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: From January 2007 through February 2011, a total of 21 clinical centers enrolled 608 participants, 6 months to 25 years of age (mean [+-SD] age, 11.5+-6.5 years in the atenolol group and 11.0+-6.2 years in the losartan group), who had an aortic-root z score greater than 3.0. The baseline-adjusted rate of change in the mean (+-SE) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the atenolol group and the losartan group (-0.139+-0.013 and -0.107+-0.013 standard-deviation units per year, respectively; P=0.08). Both slopes were significantly less than zero, indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface area with either treatment. The 3-year rates of aortic-root surgery, aortic dissection, death, and a composite of these events did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and young adults with Marfan's syndrome who were randomly assigned to losartan or atenolol, we found no significant difference in the rate of aortic-root dilatation between the two treatment groups over a 3-year period.

25292408		Peritoneal Dialysis Can Be an Option for Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: an Observational Study.BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) has been considered a relative contraindication for peritoneal dialysis (PD), although there are few specific studies available. METHODS: A multicenter historical prospective matched-cohort study was conducted to describe the outcome of ADPKD patients who have chosen PD. All ADPKD patients starting PD (n = 106) between January 2003 and December 2010 and a control group (2 consecutive patients without ADPKD) were studied. Mortality, PD-technique failure, peritonitis, abdominal wall leaks and cyst infections were compared. RESULTS: Patients with ADPKD had similar age but less comorbidity at PD inclusion: Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 4.3 (standard deviation [SD] 1.6) vs 5.3 (SD 2.5) p < 0.001, diabetes mellitus 5.7% vs 29.2%, p < 0.001 and previous cardiovascular events 10.4% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001. No differences were observed in clinical events that required transient transfer to hemodialysis, nor in peritoneal leakage episodes or delivered dialysis dose. The cyst infection rate was low (0.09 episodes per patient-year) and cyst infections were not associated to peritonitis episodes. Overall technique survival was similar in both groups. Permanent transfer to hemodialysis because of surgery or peritoneal leakage was more frequent in ADPKD. More ADPKD patients were included in the transplant waiting list (69.8 vs 58%, p = 0.04) but mean time to transplantation was similar (2.08 [1.69 - 2.47] years). The mortality rate was lower (2.5 vs 7.6 deaths/100 patient-year, p = 0.02) and the median patient survival was longer in ADPKD patients (6.04 [5.39 - 6.69] vs 5.57 [4.95 - 6.18] years, p = 0.024).

METHODS: Cross-modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype-phenotype correlations, 3D-protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, disease progression, and CoQ10 response data. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic COQ8A variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling and in vitro analysis of purified variants. COQ8A-ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early-onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss-of-function variants (82-93% vs 53%; p = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross-sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild-to-moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ10 treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8 of 11 patients (SARA: -0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that >=48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way toward large-scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A-ataxia.

Because of the patient's age, otherwise good health, and early stage of disease, he was enrolled in a research treatment protocol that involved an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). The BMT successfully put the patient in complete remission from his multiple myeloma and corrected his IgA deficiency. Class-specific IgG anti-IgA antibody that had been identified prior to BMT was no longer detectable in his plasma. Anaphylactic transfusion reactions were successfully avoided by using a combination of IgA-deficient and washed blood components including the marrow graft, and IgA-reduced intravenous immunoglobulin.

Within 5 months after BMT, the enzyme activity of the recipient's lymphocytes increased to normal range. No signs of acute or chronic GVHD were observed. For the successive 31 months post-BMT, beta-glucuronidase activity in her lymphocytes was maintained at almost normal levels and excretion of glycosaminoglycans in the urine was greatly diminished. Ultrastructural findings demonstrated no abnormal vacuoles and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of her rectal mucosal cells. Coincident with the restoration of the enzyme activity, clinical improvement was dramatic. Especially notable were improvements in motor function. The patient was able to walk alone for a long time without aid, and she even became able to ride a bicycle and take a bath. In addition, recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract and the middle ears decreased in frequency and severity, and dyspnea on exertion, severe snoring and vertigo have substantially improved. Thus, allogeneic BMT in this patient produced a better quality of life and provided a more promising outlook.
27192671	treat|@CHEMICAL_Danazol|@DISEASE_Telomeric_22q13_Monosomy_Syndrome ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Danazol|@DISEASE_Muscle_Cramp	Danazol Treatment for Telomere Diseases.BACKGROUND: Genetic defects in telomere maintenance and repair cause bone marrow failure, liver cirrhosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, and they increase susceptibility to cancer. Historically, androgens have been useful as treatment for marrow failure syndromes. In tissue culture and animal models, sex hormones regulate expression of the telomerase gene. METHODS: In a phase 1-2 prospective study involving patients with telomere diseases, we administered the synthetic sex hormone danazol orally at a dose of 800 mg per day for a total of 24 months. The goal of treatment was the attenuation of accelerated telomere attrition, and the primary efficacy end point was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured at 24 months. The occurrence of toxic effects of treatment was the primary safety end point. Hematologic response to treatment at various time points was the secondary efficacy end point. RESULTS: After 27 patients were enrolled, the study was halted early, because telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated for the primary end point; in the intention-to-treat analysis, 12 of 27 patients (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64) met the primary efficacy end point. Unexpectedly, almost all the patients (11 of 12, 92%) had a gain in telomere length at 24 months as compared with baseline (mean increase, 386 bp [95% CI, 178 to 593]); in exploratory analyses, similar increases were observed at 6 months (16 of 21 patients; mean increase, 175 bp [95% CI, 79 to 271]) and 12 months (16 of 18 patients; mean increase, 360 bp [95% CI, 209 to 512]). Hematologic responses occurred in 19 of 24 patients (79%) who could be evaluated at 3 months and in 10 of 12 patients (83%) who could be evaluated at 24 months. Known adverse effects of danazol--elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps--of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, treatment with danazol led to telomere elongation in patients with telomere diseases.

28400115		Thymus transplantation for complete DiGeorge syndrome: European experience.BACKGROUND: Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of athymic complete DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS). METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 x 106/L (range, 11-440 x 106/L) and 200 x 106/L (range, 5-310 x 106/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/106 T cells (range, 320-8,807/106 T cells) and 4,184/106 T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/106 T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and neutropenia (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with frequent autoimmune complications in survivors.
29478819		A novel Blind Start study design to investigate vestronidase alfa for mucopolysaccharidosis VII, an ultra-rare genetic disease.BACKGROUND: Drug development for ultra-rare diseases is challenging because small sample sizes and heterogeneous study populations hamper the ability of randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a single primary endpoint to demonstrate valid treatment effects. METHODS: To overcome these challenges, a novel Blind Start design was utilized in a study of vestronidase alfa in mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome), an ultra-rare lysosomal disease, that demonstrates the strengths of this approach in a challenging drug-development setting. Twelve subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 blinded groups, each crossing over to active treatment in a blinded fashion at different timepoints with efficacy analysis comparing the last assessment before cross over to after 24 weeks of treatment. Study assessments included: Percentage change from baseline in urinary GAG (uGAG); a Multi-Domain Responder Index (MDRI) using prespecified minimal important differences (6-Minute Walk Test, Forced Vital Capacity, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency); fatigue as assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  Multidimensional Fatigue Scale; and safety. RESULTS: Vestronidase alfa treatment for 24 weeks significantly reduced uGAG excretion (dermatan sulfate: 64.8%, p < 0.0001). Most subjects (10/12) had a clinically meaningful improvement in at least one MDRI domain with an overall mean change (+-SD) of +0.5 (+-0.8) at Treatment Week 24 (p = 0.0527). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Blind Start study and MDRI design improve statistical power that enhances detection of a positive treatment effect in this rare heterogeneous disease and could be utilized for other ultra-rare diseases.

Linkage and disease segregation is explained by a missense mutation c.3614G>A (p.Arg1205His) in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-gamma (EIF4G1). Subsequent sequence and genotype analysis identified EIF4G1 c.1505C>T (p.Ala502Val), c.2056G>T (p.Gly686Cys), c.3490A>C (p.Ser1164Arg), c.3589C>T (p.Arg1197Trp) and c.3614G>A (p.Arg1205His) substitutions in affected subjects with familial parkinsonism and idiopathic Lewy body disease but not in control subjects. Despite different countries of origin, persons with EIF4G1 c.1505C>T (p.Ala502Val) or c.3614G>A (p.Arg1205His) mutations appear to share haplotypes consistent with ancestral founders. eIF4G1 p.Ala502Val and p.Arg1205His disrupt eIF4E or eIF3e binding, although the wild-type protein does not, and render mutant cells more vulnerable to reactive oxidative species. EIF4G1 mutations implicate mRNA translation initiation in familial parkinsonism and highlight a convergent pathway for monogenic, toxin and perhaps virally-induced Parkinson disease.
20140965		Phenotypic manifestations and management of hyperostosis cranialis interna, a hereditary bone dysplasia affecting the calvaria and the skull base.Hyperostosis cranialis interna is a hereditary bone disorder that is characterized by endosteal hyperostosis and osteosclerosis of the calvaria and the skull base (OMIM 144755). The progressive bone overgrowth causes entrapment and dysfunction of cranial nerves I, II, V, VII, and VIII, its first symptoms often presenting during the second decade. This study analyzes the clinical course of 13 affected individuals of three related families (32 individuals). The disorder appears to have an autosomal-dominant transmission pattern. Facial and vestibulocochlear nerve dysfunction are most frequently reported. Surgical decompression of the accessible impaired cranial nerves is advised in the early symptomatic period or even in the presymptomatic period in high-risk individuals.

Mutations in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11) that codify constitutively activated Src homology protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 tyrosine phosphatase and may interfere with GH and IGF-I signaling were identified in approximately 40% of patients with NS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of PTPN11 status on response to human GH (hGH) treatment in NS children with short stature. SETTING: This study was performed at a university hospital. DESIGN: The study design was to conduct a retrospective analysis of 3 yr of hGH treatment and genotyping of PTPN11 in patients with NS. PATIENTS: Fourteen NS patients, half of them with PTPN11 mutations in heterozygous state, were studied. At the beginning of treatment, there were no clinical or laboratory differences between groups with and without mutations in the PTPN11 gene. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with hGH (47 microg/kg.d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were PTPN11 genotype, change in IGF-I levels, and change in height sd score. RESULTS: Patients with mutations in PTPN11 presented a significantly smaller increment in IGF-I levels during the treatment compared with patients without mutations (86 +/- 67 and 202 +/- 93 microg/liter, respectively; P = 0.03). hGH treatment significantly improved growth velocity in both groups, with slightly better results observed in patients without mutations. This was translated into greater gains in height sd score relation to baseline during the 3 yr of treatment in patients without mutations (+1.7 +/- 0.1) compared with those with mutations (+0.8 +/- 0.4; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the presence of PTPN11 mutations in patients with NS indicates a reduced growth response to long-term hGH treatment.
11435464		Acetylcholine receptor delta subunit mutations underlie a fast-channel myasthenic syndrome and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.Limitation of movement during fetal development may lead to multiple joint contractures in the neonate, termed arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Neuromuscular disorders are among the many different causes of reduced fetal movement. Many congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are due to mutations of the adult-specific epsilon subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), and, thus, functional deficits do not arise until late in gestation. However, an earlier effect on the fetus might be predicted with some defects of other AChR subunits. We studied a child who presented at birth with joint contractures and was subsequently found to have a CMS. Mutational screening revealed heteroallelic mutation within the AChR delta subunit gene, delta 756ins2 and delta E59K. Expression studies demonstrate that delta 756ins2 is a null mutation. By contrast, both fetal and adult AChR containing delta E59K have shorter than normal channel activations that predict fast decay of endplate currents. Thus, delta E59K causes dysfunction of fetal as well as the adult AChR and would explain the presence of joint contractures on the basis of reduced fetal movement. This is the first report of the association of AChR gene mutations with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. It is probable that mutations that severely disrupt function of fetal AChR will underlie additional cases.
3995178		Platelet-associated immunoglobulin, platelet size, and the effect of splenectomy in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) thrombocytopenia is frequently improved by splenectomy, although the mechanism of the thrombocytopenia and its resolution are unknown. Previous studies in two patients have shown that mean platelet volume, which is characteristically reduced in WAS, increased along with platelet count postsplenectomy. Additional studies in a limited number of patients have also demonstrated that platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (PAIgG) is elevated presplenectomy, but to date no postsplenectomy data have been reported. The present study was performed to more fully evaluate the effect of splenectomy on platelet volume and PAIgG in WAS. Before splenectomy, mean platelet volume was reduced but platelet size was broadly distributed with substantial overlap of the normal range. PAIgG was significantly elevated in 13 of 14 presplenectomy WAS patients (means = 78.9 fg per platelet) and fell to normal levels postoperatively (means = 4.0 fg per platelet). Platelet count and clinical status improved postsplenectomy, and mean platelet volume and platelet volume distribution returned to the normal range. WAS subjects who relapsed with recurrent thrombocytopenia redeveloped elevated PAIgG but maintained normal platelet size. The spleen appears to play a critical role in a process that may be immunologically mediated and results in reduced platelet size.

We studied 16 new Glut-1 deficiency syndrome patients focusing on clinical and laboratory features, molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlation, and treatment. These patients were classified phenotypically into three groups. The mean cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration was 33.1 +/- 4.9mg/dl equal to 37% of the simultaneous blood glucose concentration. The mean cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.3mM, which was less than the normal mean value of 1.63mM. The mean V(max) for the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake into erythrocytes was 996 fmol/10(6) red blood cells per second, significantly less (54 +/- 11%; t test, p < 0.05) than the mean control value of 1,847. The mean Km value for the patient group (1.4 +/- 0.5mM) was similar to the control group (1.7 +/- 0.5mM; t test, p > 0.05). We identified 16 rearrangements, including seven missense, one nonsense, one insertion, and seven deletion mutations. Fourteen were novel mutations. There were no obvious correlations between phenotype, genotype, or biochemical measures. The ketogenic diet produced good seizure control.

An increasing number of patients are diagnosed in early infancy, but few data are available on the introduction of a ketogenic diet in this age group. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome was suspected in four infants presenting with seizures and unexplained hypoglycorrhachia. A ketogenic diet was introduced at 6-28 weeks of age. Ketosis was initiated by fasting, monitored by bedside blood glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate determinations, and was maintained successfully using supplemented carbohydrate-free infant formula and emulgated triglycerides. All patients developed ketosis within 24 h. 3-Hydroxybutyrate concentrations available at the bedside correlated inversely with the base excess. At glucose levels < or = 40 mg/dl patients remained asymptomatic in the presence of ketones. The ketogenic formula was tolerated well, parental compliance was good, and all patients remained seizure-free on the diet. GLUT1 deficiency was confirmed in two patients; the diet was discontinued in the other two patients. In one infant, failure to thrive on medium-chain triglycerides was effectively reversed using long-chain triglycerides. Urine dipstick analyses failed to detect ketosis in another infant. Adverse effects of the diet were limited to renal stones in one patient. The ketogenic diet can be introduced and maintained successfully in young infants using long-chain fat emulsion. Monitoring 3-hydroxybutyrate at the bedside was useful for metabolic control and superior to urine dipstick analysis. Seizure control was effective and adverse effects were limited, but evaluation of the long-term effects of the ketogenic diet in this age group must await ongoing studies.

We report here an infant with clinical and laboratory features of SCID and selective CD4 lymphopenia and lack of CD28 expression on CD8(+) T cells. T cells from this patient showed poor blastogenic responses to various mitogens and IL-2. Other T cell antigen receptor- induced responses, including upregulation of CD69, were similarly inhibited. However, more proximal T cell antigen receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase, and calcium mobilization were intact. Although p59fyn and ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinases were expressed at normal levels, a marked decrease in the level of p56lck was noted. Furthermore, this decrease was associated with the presence of an alternatively spliced lck transcript lacking the exon 7 kinase encoding domain. These data suggest that a deficiency in p56lck expression can produce a SCID phenotype in humans.
21067383		Stem-cell gene therapy for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, eczema, and autoimmunity. We treated two patients who had this disorder with a transfusion of autologous, genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We found sustained expression of WAS protein expression in HSC, lymphoid and myeloid cells, and platelets after gene therapy. T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes were functionally corrected. After treatment, the patients' clinical condition markedly improved, with resolution of hemorrhagic diathesis, eczema, autoimmunity, and predisposition to severe infection.

29716835	associate|@CHEMICAL_Mannose|@CHEMICAL_Oligosaccharides	Enzyme replacement therapy with velmanase alfa (human recombinant alpha-mannosidase): Novel global treatment response model and outcomes in patients with alpha-mannosidosis.Alpha-mannosidosis is an ultra-rare monogenic disorder resulting from a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme alpha-mannosidase, with a prevalence estimated to be as low as 1:1,000,000 live births. The resulting accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in all tissues leads to a very heterogeneous disorder with a continuum of clinical manifestations with no distinctive phenotypes. Long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with velmanase alfa is approved in Europe for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis. The clinical heterogeneity and rarity of the disease limit the sensitivity of single parameters to detect clinically relevant treatment effects. Thus, we propose a novel multiple variable responder analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ERT for alpha-mannosidosis and present efficacy analyses for velmanase alfa using this method. Global treatment response to velmanase alfa (defined by response to >=2 domains comprising pharmacodynamic, functional, and quality of life outcomes) was applied post hoc to data from the pivotal placebo-controlled rhLAMAN-05 study and to the longer-term integrated data from all patients in the clinical development program (rhLAMAN-10). After 12 months of treatment, a global treatment response was achieved by 87% of patients receiving velmanase alfa (n = 15) compared with 30% of patients receiving placebo (n = 10). Longer-term data from all patients in the clinical program (n = 33) showed 88% of patients were global responders, including all (100%) pediatric patients (n = 19) and the majority (71%) of adult patients (n = 14). The responder analysis model demonstrates a clinically meaningful treatment effect with velmanase alfa and supports the early initiation and continued benefit of longer-term treatment of all patients with alpha-mannosidosis with this ERT.

Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused. OBJECTIVE: To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists. FINDINGS: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (>=200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.
17018651	associate|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis|@GENE_GH1	Growth hormone treatment improves growth and clinical status in prepubertal children with cystic fibrosis: results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT: This multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover trial of prepubertal children with cystic fibrosis (CF) tests the hypotheses that recombinant human GH (rhGH) treatment 1) improves height, weight, lean mass, and bone content irrespective of baseline measures; 2) improves clinical status and quality of life; and 3) has continued effect after cessation after 1 yr of treatment. METHODS: Sixty-one prepubertal subjects (<or=25th percentile for height and weight) were randomized into two groups: daily rhGH treatment or no treatment groups for 1 yr. In yr 2, treatments were crossed over. Outcome measures included serial standardized height and weight, number of hospitalizations and antibiotic courses, random blood glucose levels, lean mass, bone mineral content, pulmonary function, nutritional intake, and CF quality of life questionnaires. RESULTS: Groups were similar at baseline and prepubertal during the entire study. After 1 yr, GH showed significantly greater gain in height, weight, lean mass, and bone mineral content. Gain in height was similar regardless of baseline. There were fewer hospitalizations in the rhGH-treated group and improvement in CF quality of life questionnaires measures of weight and body image. There was no difference in pulmonary function between groups. Results were similar in those treated with rhGH the second year. After cessation of rhGH treatment, there was sustained effect for increased height and weight velocity, as well as accrual of bone mineral. CONCLUSION: rhGH therapy improves height and weight, decreases the number of hospitalizations, and improves quality of life in prepubertal children with CF. These effects are sustained after rhGH is discontinued.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report AP2S1 mutation and effects of low calcium formula in a patient with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. PATIENT: This Japanese female infant was found to have hypercalcemia by a routine laboratory test for poor weight gain on breast feeding. At 49 days of age, serum calcium (adjusted by Payne's formula) was 13.1 mg/dL, intact PTH 27 pg/mL, and urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio 1.29 mg/mg. There was no evidence for hyperparathyroidism, PTHrP-producing neoplasm, and vitamin D excess. These data, except for hypercalciuria, appeared to be consistent with defective calcium-sensing receptor-mediated signaling. With use of low calcium formula containing 2.6 mg/dL of calcium, she showed catch-up growth, and serum calcium was decreased, as was urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio. Furthermore, feeding with a mixture of low calcium formula and standard formula with a 2:1 ratio maintained serum calcium ~12 mg/dL without markedly increasing serum PTH. RESULTS: Although no pathologic mutation was detected in CASR or GNA11, a presumably de novo heterozygous mutation (p.Arg15Leu), a previously reported causative mutation for FHH3, was identified in AP2S1 of this patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that lack of hypocalciuria does not necessarily argue against the presence of AP2S1 mutations. The early infantile age of this patient would have played a certain role in the occurrence of hypercalciuria, and low calcium formula is worth attempting in infants with FHH.
19067349		Umbilical cord blood transplantation for juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy.Three siblings with metachromatic leukodystrophy underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation at different stages of disease. Neuroimaging, nerve conduction studies, neurological examinations, and neuropsychological examinations were used to measure outcome over 2 years. After transplant, the oldest sibling experienced disease progression. His two siblings had near or total resolution of signal abnormalities on neuroimaging. Their neuropsychological testing remained stable, and nerve conduction studies have shown improvement. These results indicate pretransplantation neurological examinations may be the most significant predictor of outcome after transplant. To our knowledge, this report is the first to document neurological outcome of metachromatic leukodystrophy treated by umbilical cord blood transplantation.

METHODS: This prospective, comparative nonrandomized clinical interventional study included 13 patients with progressive exudative age-related macular degeneration with occult, or predominantly occult, subfoveal neovascularization. All patients had shown an increase or stabilization of visual acuity after a first intravitreal injection of 25 mg of triamcinolone acetonide. They received a second intravitreal injection of 25 mg of triamcinolone acetonide 3.1 to 18 months after the first injection. Mean +/- SD follow-up time after the second injection was 5.2 +/- 3.6 months (median, 5.3 months). A control group included 24 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration who did not receive treatment for their maculopathy. The main outcome measures were visual acuity and intraocular pressure. RESULTS: In the study group, mean +/- SD visual acuity increased significantly (P =.005 and P =.003, respectively) from 0.17 +/- 0.11 to 0.32 +/- 0.26 and from 0.15 +/- 0.14 to 0.23 +/- 0.19, respectively, after the first and second injections. An increase in visual acuity was found for 10 patients (77%) after the first and second injections. In the control group, visual acuity did not vary significantly during follow-up (P =.81). The difference in change in visual acuity between the study group and control group was significant (P =.01 [Snellen lines] and P =.05 [logMAR units]). The peak in visual acuity and, in a chronologically parallel manner, the peak in intraocular pressure elevation occurred 2 to 5 months after each injection. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated intravitreal injection of 25 mg of triamcinolone acetonide may lead to an increase in visual acuity in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration, with the peak in visual acuity and intraocular pressure elevation occurring about 2 to 5 months after each injection.

11316696	inhibit|@DISEASE_Noonan_Syndrome|@GENE_GH1	Short stature in Noonan syndrome: response to growth hormone therapy.BACKGROUND: Growth hormone (GH) has been used to promote growth in both the short and long term in a number of dysmorphic syndromes, including Turner syndrome. As this condition shares many clinical features with Noonan syndrome, it would seem logical to treat the latter group with GH. AIMS: To assess the short and long term response to GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome. METHODS: Analysis of patients with Noonan syndrome in the Pharmacia & Upjohn International Growth Study (this post-marketing database contains data on the majority of patients currently treated with GH in the UK). A questionnaire was also sent to participating clinicians. RESULTS: Data on 66 patients (54 males) were available for study. At the start of GH therapy children were short, compared with both normal and Noonan children. During the first year of GH therapy height velocity increased from a mean of 4.9 to 7.2 cm per year. For patients treated long term with GH, mean height SDS increased from -2.9 pretreatment to -2.6 after one year and -2.3 after five years. Of the 10 patients at near final height, only one had a height above the 3rd centile for normal adults and above the mean for untreated Noonan patients. The mean increment in final height was 3.1 cm (range -1.1 to 6.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: GH therapy in patients with Noonan syndrome will improve height velocity in the short term. Longer-term therapy results in a waning of effect; initial indications are that final height is not improved substantially in most patients.
32792226	associate|@DISEASE_Leukodystrophy_Metachromatic|@GENE_ARSA	Safety of intrathecal delivery of recombinant human arylsulfatase A in children with metachromatic leukodystrophy: Results from a phase 1/2 clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficient arylsulfatase A (ASA) activity and characterized by neurological involvement that results in severe disability and premature death. We examined the safety and tolerability of intrathecally delivered recombinant human ASA (rhASA; SHP611, now TAK-611) in children with MLD (NCT01510028). Secondary endpoints included change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sulfatide and lysosulfatide levels, and motor function (assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 total score). METHODS: Twenty-four children with MLD who experienced symptom onset aged <= 30 months were enrolled. Patients received rhASA every other week (EOW) for 38 weeks at 10, 30, or 100 mg (cohorts 1-3; n = 6 per cohort), or 100 mg manufactured using a revised process (cohort 4; n = 6). RESULTS: No rhASA-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed; 25% of patients experienced an SAE related to the intrathecal device or drug delivery method. Mean CSF sulfatide and lysosulfatide levels fell to within normal ranges in both 100 mg cohorts following treatment. Although there was a general decline in motor function over time, there was a tendency towards a less pronounced decline in patients receiving 100 mg. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal rhASA was generally well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg EOW. These preliminary data support further development of rhASA as a therapy for patients with MLD.

Progress in defining the molecular bases does not often translate into effective treatment. Notable exceptions include certain inborn errors of metabolism amenable to dietary intervention. CAD encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Alternatively, pyrimidines can be recycled from uridine. Exome sequencing in three families identified biallelic CAD mutations in four children with global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and anaemia with anisopoikilocytosis. Two died aged 4 and 5 years after a neurodegenerative disease course. Supplementation of the two surviving children with oral uridine led to immediate cessation of seizures in both. A 4-year-old female, previously in a minimally conscious state, began to communicate and walk with assistance after 9 weeks of treatment. A 3-year-old female likewise showed developmental progress. Blood smears normalized and anaemia resolved. We establish CAD as a gene confidently implicated in this neurometabolic disorder, characterized by co-occurrence of global developmental delay, dyserythropoietic anaemia and seizures. While the natural disease course can be lethal in early childhood, our findings support the efficacy of uridine supplementation, rendering CAD deficiency a treatable neurometabolic disorder and therefore a potential condition for future (genetic) newborn screening.
28237137		Glaucoma treatment trends: a review.Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing. The aim of the present review is to describe the current medical and surgical treatment trends in the management of open-angle glaucoma. There has been an increase in the availability of glaucoma medications and the use of laser trabeculoplasty over the past decade, with a subsequent decrease in invasive incisional surgery. In addition, a new class of glaucoma procedures, termed microinvasive glaucoma surgery, has emerged, which aims to fill the gap between conservative medical management and more invasive surgery.
15184617	associate|@DISEASE_Peroxisome_biogenesis_disorders|@GENE_PEX12	Reinvestigation of trihydroxycholestanoic acidemia reveals a peroxisome biogenesis disorder.OBJECTIVE: To determine the enzymatic defect in a patient with ataxia, dysarthric speech, dry skin, hypotonia, and absent reflexes. The patient was previously diagnosed with a presumed deficiency of trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase. BACKGROUND: Peroxisomes harbor a variety of metabolic functions, including fatty acid beta-oxidation, etherphospholipid biosynthesis, phytanic acid alpha-oxidation, and L-pipecolic acid oxidation. This patient was previously described with an isolated peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect caused by a deficiency of the enzyme trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase. This was based on the pattern of accumulating metabolites. METHODS: Measurement of beta-oxidation enzymes, peroxisomal biochemical analysis in body fluids and cultured skin fibroblasts, and DNA analysis of the PEX12 gene were performed. RESULTS: An isolated beta-oxidation defect in this patient was excluded by measurement of the various beta-oxidation enzymes. The authors found that the patient had a peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutations in the PEX12 gene, although all peroxisomal functions in cultured skin fibroblasts were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of clear peroxisomal abnormalities in the patient's fibroblasts, including a normal peroxisomal localization of catalase, implies that even when all peroxisomal functions in fibroblasts are normal, a peroxisome biogenesis disorder cannot be fully excluded, and further studies may be needed. In addition, the authors' findings imply that there is no longer evidence for the existence of trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase deficiency as a distinct disease entity.
8790089		Management of ectopia lentis in a family with Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of combined pars plana vitrectomy-lensectomy and open-loop anterior chamber lens implantation for the management of ectopia lentis associated with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of 4 consecutive patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent combined pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and anterior chamber lens implantation at our institution between August 1994 and July 1995. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated postoperative visual acuity of 20/25 or better during an average follow-up period of 6 months (range, 4-9 months). Two patients developed pseudophakic pupillary block and required YAG laser iridotomy postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation appears to be an excellent technique for the management of ectopia lentis associated with Marfan syndrome. A bimanual, closed-system endosurgical technique avoids many of the complications previously associated with surgery for ectopia lentis.

DESIGN: Patients with documented SGCE-M-D undergoing bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum were recruited. Standardized assessments of M-D were videorecorded before surgery and 6 to 9 months and 15 to 18 months after surgery, using the movement and disability subscales of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale. The analysis was based on blinded evaluation of the recordings. SETTING: Movement disorder unit in a university hospital in Paris. PATIENTS: Five consecutive patients with documented SGCE-M-D. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Myoclonus and dystonia scores at follow-up. RESULTS: The median myoclonus score decreased from 76 before surgery (range, 38-116) to 10 at 6 to 9 months after surgery (range, 6-31). The median dystonia score decreased from 30.0 before surgery (range, 18.5-53.0) to 4.5 after surgery (range, 3.5-16.0). Disability was also improved and symptoms remained stable between the postoperative evaluations. No adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum is safe and highly effective in this homogeneous population of patients with SGCE-M-D. This therapeutic option should therefore be considered for patients with severe, drug-resistant forms of the disorder.

In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. METHODS: A clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants. After confirmation of TP53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. Patients could cross over between groups at any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. Two additional cancers were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed cancer (p=0 012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 88 8% (95% CI 78 7-100) in the surveillance group and 59 6% (47 2-75 2) in the non-surveillance group (p=0 0132). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic TP53 variants is feasible and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these patients should be considered.

8097803	associate|@DISEASE_Peripheral_Nervous_System_Diseases|@GENE_TTR ;associate|@DISEASE_AA_amyloidosis|@GENE_TTR	Clinical improvement and amyloid regression after liver transplantation in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a fatal autosomal dominant disorder. Progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy are associated with neural and visceral deposition of amyloid, derived most commonly from the Met-30 variant of the plasma protein transthyretin. We have reported previously that orthotopic liver transplantation causes prompt replacement of variant transthyretin by the donor wild-type in the plasma. We now report clinical outcome 1-2 years after transplantation. Three of the first four patients have improved general wellbeing, walking ability, and bowel function, and one of them has regained normal bladder and bowel function. There has been little objective improvement in peripheral neuropathy. The fourth patient, who had the most severe neurological deficits and a complicated postoperative course, has not improved but there has been no further deterioration in contrast to the inexorable progression before transplantation. Quantitative scintigraphy with radiolabelled serum amyloid P component showed visceral amyloid deposits in all three patients studied; in two who were followed serially the deposits regressed after transplantation in association with the clinical improvement. Another FAP patient who was also monitored prospectively for 2 years but who did not undergo transplantation, showed, as expected, progression of neuropathy and increased visceral amyloid deposition. Liver transplantation does therefore have important benefits in FAP during the first 2 years after surgery. Neurological decline is halted and amyloid deposits can be mobilised. The best timing and long-term results of the procedure must now be established.

Our aim was to fully characterize a defect in bile acid synthesis in a 2-week-old African-American girl presenting with coagulopathy, vitamin D and E deficiencies, and mild cholestasis and in her sibling, whose liver had been used for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: Bile acids were measured by mass spectrometry in urine, bile, serum, and feces of the patient and in urine from the unrelated recipient. RESULTS: Liver biopsy specimens showed neonatal hepatitis with giant cell transformation and hepatocyte necrosis; peroxisomes were reduced in number. High concentrations of (25R)3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid in the urine, bile, and serum established a pattern similar to that of Zellweger syndrome and identical to the Alligator mississippiensis. Serum phytanic acid was normal, whereas pristanic acid was markedly elevated. Biochemical, MRI, and neurologic findings were inconsistent with a generalized defect of peroxisomal function and were unique. Analysis of the urine from the recipient of the deceased sibling's liver confirmed the same bile acid synthetic defect. A deficiency in 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which is essential for conversion of (25R)THCA to its 25S-isomer, the substrate to initiate peroxisomal beta-oxidation to primary bile acids, was confirmed by DNA analysis revealing a missense mutation (S52P) in the gene encoding this enzyme. Long-term treatment with cholic acid normalized liver enzymes and prevented progression of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This genetic defect further highlights bile acid synthetic defects as a cause of neonatal cholestasis.

Two patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) from matched-related donors, 2 received PBSCs from matched-unrelated donors, and 2 received stem cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) donors. Recipients of matched-related and -unrelated donors received fludarabine and 200 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI); UCB recipients received cyclophosphamide in addition to fludarabine and TBI as conditioning. All patients received tacrolimus and sirolimus posttransplantation. Five patients were alive at a median follow-up of 17.4 months (range, 10-25). All patients achieved high levels of donor engraftment in the hematopoietic compartments that were deficient pretransplantation. Adverse events consisted of delayed engraftment in the recipient of a single UCB, GVHD in 4 patients, and immune-mediated pancytopenia and nephrotic syndrome in the recipient of a double UCB transplantation. Nonmyeloablative HSCT in GATA2 deficiency results in reconstitution of the severely deficient monocyte, B-cell, and NK-cell populations and reversal of the clinical phenotype.

ALG3-CDG is a very rare subtype with only 24 cases reported so far. CASE: Here, we report two siblings with dysmorphic features, growth retardation, microcephaly, intractable epilepsy, and hemangioma in the frontal, occipital and lumbosacral regions. RESULTS: We studied two siblings by whole exome sequencing. A pathogenic variant in ALG3 (NM_005787.6: c.165C > T; p.Gly55=) that had been previously associated with congenital glycolysis defect type 1d was identified. Their intractable seizures were controlled by ketogenic diet. CONCLUSION: Although prominent findings of growth retardation and microcephaly seen in our patients have been extensively reported before, presence of hemangioma is a novel finding that may be used as an indication for ALG3-CDG diagnosis. Our patients are the first reported cases whose intractable seizures were controlled with ketogenic diet. This report adds ketogenic diet as an option for treatment of intractable epilepsy in ALG3-CDG.

METHOD: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the European Registry and Network for Intoxication type Metabolic Diseases (Chafea no. December 1, 2010). RESULTS: Data from 28 cblA and 95 mut patients in most cases confirmed by mutation analysis (including 4 new mutations for cblA and 19 new mutations for mut). Metabolic crisis is the predominant symptom leading to diagnosis in both groups. Biochemical disturbances during the first crisis were similar in both groups, as well as the age at diagnosis. Z scores of body height and body weight were similar in both groups at birth, but were significantly lower in the mut group at the time of last visit. Glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in cblA; and as a consequence, chronic renal failure and related complications were significantly less frequent and renal function could be preserved even in older patients. Neurological complications were predominantly found in the mut subgroup. Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) levels in urine and plasma were significantly lower in cblA. 27/28 cblA patients were reported to be responsive to cobalamin, only 86% of cblA patients were treated with i.m. hydroxocobalamin. In total, 73% of cblA and 98% of mut patients followed a calculated diet with amino acid supplements in 27% (cblA) and 69% (mut). During the study interval, six patients from the mut group died, while all cblA patients survived. CONCLUSION: Although similar at first, cblA patients respond to hydroxocobalamin treatment, subsequently show significantly lower levels of MMA and a milder course than mut patients.

The main features are pugilistic facies, skeletal deformities, and muscular hypertrophy despite a lack of exercise and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy leading to premature death. METHODS AND RESULTS: An  19 Mb critical region on X chromosome was identified through identity-by-descent analysis of 3 affected males. Exome sequencing was conducted on one affected male to identify the disease-causing gene and variant. A splice site variant (c.502-2A>G) in the FHL1 gene was highly suspicious among other candidate genes and variants. FHL1A is the predominant isoform of FHL1 in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Sequencing cDNA showed the splice site variant led to skipping of exons 6 of the FHL1A isoform, equivalent to the FHL1C isoform. Targeted analysis showed that this splice site variant cosegregated with disease in the family. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of muscle from the proband showed a significant decrease in protein expression of FHL1A. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of different isoforms of FHL1 demonstrated that the FHL1C is markedly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the FHL1 gene have been reported in disorders with skeletal and cardiac myopathy but none has the skeletal or facial phenotype seen in patients with Uruguay syndrome. Our data suggest that a novel FHL1 splice site variant results in the absence of FHL1A and the abundance of FHL1C, which may contribute to the complex and severe phenotype. Mutation screening of the FHL1 gene should be considered for patients with uncharacterized myopathies and cardiomyopathies.
20091517	treat|@CHEMICAL_Phenylalanine|@DISEASE_Phenylketonurias	Dietary interventions for phenylketonuria.BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent mental handicap; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a low-phenylalanine diet commenced early in life for people with phenylketonuria. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 05 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a low-phenylalanine diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with phenylketonuria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low-phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months -698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) -869.44 to -527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of non-randomised studies have concluded that a low-phenylalanine diet is effective in reducing blood phenylalanine levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low-phenylalanine diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non-randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low-phenylalanine diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of phenylalanine restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies.

METHODS: Case ascertainment, literature review, comprehensive evaluations, and long-term treatment with flumazenil. RESULTS: All patients presented with neonatal or early infantile-onset encephalopathy; other features were hypotonia, hypersomnolence, epilepsy, choreoathetosis, and accelerated linear growth. EEGs showed burst-suppression, modified hypsarrhythmia, multifocal spikes, and generalized spike-wave. Five of the 10 patients are currently alive with age at last follow-up between 18 months and 9.5 years. Treatment with continuous flumazenil was implemented in 2 patients. One patient, with a milder phenotype, began treatment at age 21 months and has continued for 20 months with improved alertness and less excessive adventitious movements. The second patient had a more severe phenotype and was 7 years of age at initiation of flumazenil, which was not continued. CONCLUSIONS: GABA-transaminase deficiency presents with neonatal or infantile-onset encephalopathy including hypersomnolence and choreoathetosis. A widened phenotypic spectrum is reported as opposed to lethality by 2 years of age. The GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil may represent a therapeutic strategy.

These mutations prevent the synthesis of the full-length protein but allow the synthesis of its short isoform, GATA-1s. Experiments in mice suggest that GATA-1s supports normal adult megakaryopoiesis, platelet formation and erythropoiesis. Here we report a mutation, 332G --> C, in exon 2 of GATA1, leading to the synthesis of only the short isoform in seven affected males from two generations of a family. Hematological profiles of affected males demonstrate macrocytic anemia, normal platelet counts and neutropenia in most cases. Altogether, data suggest that GATA-1s alone, produced in low or normal levels, is not sufficient to support normal erythropoiesis. Moreover, this is the first study to indicate that a germline splicing mutation does not lead to leukemia in the absence of other cooperating events, such as Down syndrome.
