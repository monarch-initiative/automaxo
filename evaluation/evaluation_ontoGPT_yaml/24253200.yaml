input_text: 'Treatable childhood neuronopathy caused by mutations in riboflavin transporter
  RFVT2.Childhood onset motor neuron diseases or neuronopathies are a clinically heterogeneous
  group of disorders. A particularly severe subgroup first described in 1894, and
  subsequently called Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, is characterized by progressive
  pontobulbar palsy, sensorineural hearing loss and respiratory insufficiency. There
  has been no treatment for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which leads
  to respiratory failure and usually death during childhood. We recently reported
  the identification of SLC52A2, encoding riboflavin transporter RFVT2, as a new causative
  gene for Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. We used both exome and Sanger sequencing
  to identify SLC52A2 mutations in patients presenting with cranial neuropathies and
  sensorimotor neuropathy with or without respiratory insufficiency. We undertook
  clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical characterization of patients with mutations
  in SLC52A2, functionally analysed the most prevalent mutations and initiated a regimen
  of high-dose oral riboflavin. We identified 18 patients from 13 families with compound
  heterozygous or homozygous mutations in SLC52A2. Affected individuals share a core
  phenotype of rapidly progressive axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (manifesting with
  sensory ataxia, severe weakness of the upper limbs and axial muscles with distinctly
  preserved strength of the lower limbs), hearing loss, optic atrophy and respiratory
  insufficiency. We demonstrate that SLC52A2 mutations cause reduced riboflavin uptake
  and reduced riboflavin transporter protein expression, and we report the response
  to high-dose oral riboflavin therapy in patients with SLC52A2 mutations, including
  significant and sustained clinical and biochemical improvements in two patients
  and preliminary clinical response data in 13 patients with associated biochemical
  improvements in 10 patients. The clinical and biochemical responses of this SLC52A2-specific
  cohort suggest that riboflavin supplementation can ameliorate the progression of
  this neurodegenerative condition, particularly when initiated soon after the onset
  of symptoms. '
