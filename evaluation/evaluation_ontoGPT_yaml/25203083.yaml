input_text: 'Management of sickle cell disease: summary of the 2014 evidence-based
  report by expert panel members.IMPORTANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening
  genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is
  associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical
  attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions,
  are available but underused. OBJECTIVE: To support and expand the number of health
  professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD. EVIDENCE REVIEW:
  Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE,
  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
  Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms
  and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention
  studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications
  from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed
  by the expert panel members and methodologists. FINDINGS: Strong recommendations
  for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age
  of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years
  in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke
  in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (>=200 cm/s). Strong
  recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids
  for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of
  incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong
  recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical
  therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
  inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations
  for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral
  to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography
  to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended
  for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period,
  with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe
  or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength
  suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms
  for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative
  transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended
  with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of
  less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy.
  A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength
  recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
  Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals
  with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less
  than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management,
  and monitoring for individuals with SCD.'
