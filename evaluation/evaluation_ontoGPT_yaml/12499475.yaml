input_text: 'Mutations in GDAP1: autosomal recessive CMT with demyelination and axonopathy.BACKGROUND:
  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1)
  were recently shown to be responsible for autosomal recessive (AR) demyelinating
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 4A (CMT4A) as well as AR axonal CMT with
  vocal cord paralysis. METHODS: The coding region of GDAP1 was screened for the presence
  of mutations in seven families with AR CMT in which the patients were homozygous
  for markers of the CMT4A locus at chromosome 8q21.1. RESULTS: A nonsense mutation
  was detected in exon 5 (c.581C>G, S194X), a 1-bp deletion in exon 6 (c.786delG,
  G262fsX284), and a missense mutation in exon 6 (c.844C>T, R282C). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations
  in GDAP1 are a frequent cause of AR CMT. They result in an early-onset, severe clinical
  phenotype. The range of nerve conduction velocities (NCV) is variable. Some patients
  have normal or near normal NCV, suggesting an axonal neuropathy, whereas others
  have severely slowed NCV compatible with demyelination. The peripheral nerve biopsy
  findings are equally variable and show features of demyelination and axonal degeneration.'
