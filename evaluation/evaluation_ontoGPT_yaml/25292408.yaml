input_text: 'Peritoneal Dialysis Can Be an Option for Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease:
  an Observational Study.BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
  (ADPKD) has been considered a relative contraindication for peritoneal dialysis
  (PD), although there are few specific studies available. METHODS: A multicenter
  historical prospective matched-cohort study was conducted to describe the outcome
  of ADPKD patients who have chosen PD. All ADPKD patients starting PD (n = 106) between
  January 2003 and December 2010 and a control group (2 consecutive patients without
  ADPKD) were studied. Mortality, PD-technique failure, peritonitis, abdominal wall
  leaks and cyst infections were compared. RESULTS: Patients with ADPKD had similar
  age but less comorbidity at PD inclusion: Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 4.3 (standard
  deviation [SD] 1.6) vs 5.3 (SD 2.5) p < 0.001, diabetes mellitus 5.7% vs 29.2%,
  p < 0.001 and previous cardiovascular events 10.4% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001. No differences
  were observed in clinical events that required transient transfer to hemodialysis,
  nor in peritoneal leakage episodes or delivered dialysis dose. The cyst infection
  rate was low (0.09 episodes per patient-year) and cyst infections were not associated
  to peritonitis episodes. Overall technique survival was similar in both groups.
  Permanent transfer to hemodialysis because of surgery or peritoneal leakage was
  more frequent in ADPKD. More ADPKD patients were included in the transplant waiting
  list (69.8 vs 58%, p = 0.04) but mean time to transplantation was similar (2.08
  [1.69 - 2.47] years). The mortality rate was lower (2.5 vs 7.6 deaths/100 patient-year,
  p = 0.02) and the median patient survival was longer in ADPKD patients (6.04 [5.39
  - 6.69] vs 5.57 [4.95 - 6.18] years, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis
  is a suitable renal replacement therapy option for ADPKD patients.'
