input_text: 'Growth hormone treatment improves growth and clinical status in prepubertal
  children with cystic fibrosis: results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT:
  This multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover trial of prepubertal children
  with cystic fibrosis (CF) tests the hypotheses that recombinant human GH (rhGH)
  treatment 1) improves height, weight, lean mass, and bone content irrespective of
  baseline measures; 2) improves clinical status and quality of life; and 3) has continued
  effect after cessation after 1 yr of treatment. METHODS: Sixty-one prepubertal subjects
  (<or=25th percentile for height and weight) were randomized into two groups: daily
  rhGH treatment or no treatment groups for 1 yr. In yr 2, treatments were crossed
  over. Outcome measures included serial standardized height and weight, number of
  hospitalizations and antibiotic courses, random blood glucose levels, lean mass,
  bone mineral content, pulmonary function, nutritional intake, and CF quality of
  life questionnaires. RESULTS: Groups were similar at baseline and prepubertal during
  the entire study. After 1 yr, GH showed significantly greater gain in height, weight,
  lean mass, and bone mineral content. Gain in height was similar regardless of baseline.
  There were fewer hospitalizations in the rhGH-treated group and improvement in CF
  quality of life questionnaires measures of weight and body image. There was no difference
  in pulmonary function between groups. Results were similar in those treated with
  rhGH the second year. After cessation of rhGH treatment, there was sustained effect
  for increased height and weight velocity, as well as accrual of bone mineral. CONCLUSION:
  rhGH therapy improves height and weight, decreases the number of hospitalizations,
  and improves quality of life in prepubertal children with CF. These effects are
  sustained after rhGH is discontinued.'
