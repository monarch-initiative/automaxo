input_text: 'Progressive Movement Disorder in Brothers Carrying a GNAO1 Mutation Responsive
  to Deep Brain Stimulation.GNAO1, located on chromosome 16q12.2, encodes for 1 of
  the heterotrimeric guanine binding proteins subunits (G proteins), specifically
  Galphao, which has been implicated as having an important role in brain function.
  GNAO1 mutations have been shown to impart oncogene properties as well as cause epileptic
  encephalopathy. The authors report 2 cases of brothers with a severe movement disorder
  and hypotonia without epilepsy who have been confirmed by whole exome sequencing
  to have a novel mutation in GNAO1. Their movement disorder improved significantly
  with deep brain stimulation. '
