input_text: Antifibrinolytic Therapy and Perioperative Considerations.Fibrinolysis
  is a physiologic component of hemostasis that functions to limit clot formation.
  However, after trauma or surgery, excessive fibrinolysis may contribute to coagulopathy,
  bleeding, and inflammatory responses. Antifibrinolytic agents are increasingly used
  to reduce bleeding, allogeneic blood administration, and adverse clinical outcomes.
  Tranexamic acid is the agent most extensively studied and used in most countries.
  This review will explore the role of fibrinolysis as a pathologic mechanism, review
  the different pharmacologic agents used to inhibit fibrinolysis, and focus on the
  role of tranexamic acid as a therapeutic agent to reduce bleeding in patients after
  surgery and trauma.
