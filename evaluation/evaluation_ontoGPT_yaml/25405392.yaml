input_text: "Atenolol versus losartan in children and young adults with Marfan's syndrome.BACKGROUND:
  Aortic-root dissection is the leading cause of death in Marfan's syndrome. Studies
  suggest that with regard to slowing aortic-root enlargement, losartan may be more
  effective than beta-blockers, the current standard therapy in most centers. METHODS:
  We conducted a randomized trial comparing losartan with atenolol in children and
  young adults with Marfan's syndrome. The primary outcome was the rate of aortic-root
  enlargement, expressed as the change in the maximum aortic-root-diameter z score
  indexed to body-surface area (hereafter, aortic-root z score) over a 3-year period.
  Secondary outcomes included the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic
  root; the rate of change in aortic regurgitation; the time to aortic dissection,
  aortic-root surgery, or death; somatic growth; and the incidence of adverse events.
  RESULTS: From January 2007 through February 2011, a total of 21 clinical centers
  enrolled 608 participants, 6 months to 25 years of age (mean [+-SD] age, 11.5+-6.5
  years in the atenolol group and 11.0+-6.2 years in the losartan group), who had
  an aortic-root z score greater than 3.0. The baseline-adjusted rate of change in
  the mean (+-SE) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the atenolol
  group and the losartan group (-0.139+-0.013 and -0.107+-0.013 standard-deviation
  units per year, respectively; P=0.08). Both slopes were significantly less than
  zero, indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface
  area with either treatment. The 3-year rates of aortic-root surgery, aortic dissection,
  death, and a composite of these events did not differ significantly between the
  two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and young adults with Marfan's
  syndrome who were randomly assigned to losartan or atenolol, we found no significant
  difference in the rate of aortic-root dilatation between the two treatment groups
  over a 3-year period. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and
