input_text: 'Clinico-Genetic, Imaging and Molecular Delineation of COQ8A-Ataxia: A
  Multicenter Study of 59 Patients.OBJECTIVE: To foster trial-readiness of coenzyme
  Q8A (COQ8A)-ataxia, we map the clinicogenetic, molecular, and neuroimaging spectrum
  of COQ8A-ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data,
  including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). METHODS: Cross-modal analysis
  of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype-phenotype correlations,
  3D-protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
  markers, disease progression, and CoQ10 response data. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients
  (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic COQ8A variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense
  variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling
  and in vitro analysis of purified variants. COQ8A-ataxia presented as variable multisystemic,
  early-onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy
  (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic
  movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms.
  Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss-of-function
  variants (82-93% vs 53%; p = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%),
  with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%.
  Cross-sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated
  mild-to-moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ10 treatment led to
  improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal
  assessments in 8 of 11 patients (SARA: -0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations
  indicate that >=48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions
  that reduce progression by 50%. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a deeper understanding
  of the disease, and paves the way toward large-scale natural history studies and
  treatment trials in COQ8A-ataxia. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:251-263.'
