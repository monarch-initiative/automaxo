input_text: 'Biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline TP53 mutation carriers
  with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: 11 year follow-up of a prospective observational study.BACKGROUND:
  Carriers of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk
  of developing cancer. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members
  of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for
  individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment
  of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer
  follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance,
  as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. METHODS: A clinical
  surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging
  studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal
  and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres
  in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants.
  After confirmation of TP53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance
  or chose not to undergo surveillance. Patients could cross over between groups at
  any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance
  investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established
  from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one
  diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach.
  FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of TP53
  pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance
  and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance
  to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance
  for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected
  in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. Two additional cancers were
  diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions
  were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the
  49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were
  diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance
  who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing
  surveillance who developed cancer (p=0 012) after a median follow-up of 46 months
  (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance.
  5 year overall survival was 88 8% (95% CI 78 7-100) in the surveillance group and
  59 6% (47 2-75 2) in the non-surveillance group (p=0 0132). INTERPRETATION: Our
  findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol
  for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic TP53 variants is feasible
  and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved
  long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these
  patients should be considered. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes for Heath Research,
