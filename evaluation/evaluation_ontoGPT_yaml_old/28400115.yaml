input_text: 'Thymus transplantation for complete DiGeorge syndrome: European experience.BACKGROUND:
  Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of athymic complete
  DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS). METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation
  with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the
  results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing
  viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune
  thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting
  in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed
  from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive
  CD4 counts were 44 x 106/L (range, 11-440 x 106/L) and 200 x 106/L (range, 5-310
  x 106/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision
  circles were 2,238/106 T cells (range, 320-8,807/106 T cells) and 4,184/106 T cells
  (range, 1,582-24,596/106 T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for
  age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired
  later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic
  antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation
  of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue,
  including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body
  formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications
  were seen in 7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis
  settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune
  problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and neutropenia
  (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation
  can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with frequent autoimmune complications
  in survivors.'
