input_text: 'Primary viscocanalostomy versus trabeculectomy for primary open-angle
  glaucoma: three-year prospective randomized clinical trial.PURPOSE: To compare the
  efficacy and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in patients with primary
  open-angle glaucoma (POAG). SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara Education
  and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial,
  50 eyes of 50 patients with medically uncontrolled POAG were randomized to have
  a trabeculectomy (25 eyes) or a viscocanalostomy (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular
  pressure (IOP), and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day,
  1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively. RESULTS: At 3
  years, the mean IOP was 16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07 (SD) in the trabeculectomy group and
  17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (IOP
  6 to 21 mm Hg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and
  55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively,
  in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Qualified success (IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with
  medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the
  trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy
  group (P>.05). Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently
  in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS:
  Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients.
  However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.'
