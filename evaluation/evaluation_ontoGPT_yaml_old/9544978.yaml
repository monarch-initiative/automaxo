input_text: Transfusion management of an IgA deficient patient with anti-IgA and incidental
  correction of IgA deficiency after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.A patient
  with multiple myeloma was noted to have an IgA deficiency during investigation of
  a possible transfusion reaction due to IgA deficiency and anti-IgA. Because of the
  patient's age, otherwise good health, and early stage of disease, he was enrolled
  in a research treatment protocol that involved an allogeneic bone marrow transplant
  (BMT). The BMT successfully put the patient in complete remission from his multiple
  myeloma and corrected his IgA deficiency. Class-specific IgG anti-IgA antibody that
  had been identified prior to BMT was no longer detectable in his plasma. Anaphylactic
  transfusion reactions were successfully avoided by using a combination of IgA-deficient
  and washed blood components including the marrow graft, and IgA-reduced intravenous
  immunoglobulin.
