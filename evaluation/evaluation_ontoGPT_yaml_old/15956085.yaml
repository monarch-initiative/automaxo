input_text: 'PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11) mutations
  and response to growth hormone therapy in children with Noonan syndrome.CONTEXT:
  The cause of growth impairment in Noonan syndrome (NS) remains unclear. Mutations
  in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11) that codify constitutively
  activated Src homology protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 tyrosine phosphatase and may
  interfere with GH and IGF-I signaling were identified in approximately 40% of patients
  with NS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of
  PTPN11 status on response to human GH (hGH) treatment in NS children with short
  stature. SETTING: This study was performed at a university hospital. DESIGN: The
  study design was to conduct a retrospective analysis of 3 yr of hGH treatment and
  genotyping of PTPN11 in patients with NS. PATIENTS: Fourteen NS patients, half of
  them with PTPN11 mutations in heterozygous state, were studied. At the beginning
  of treatment, there were no clinical or laboratory differences between groups with
  and without mutations in the PTPN11 gene. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with
  hGH (47 microg/kg.d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were PTPN11
  genotype, change in IGF-I levels, and change in height sd score. RESULTS: Patients
  with mutations in PTPN11 presented a significantly smaller increment in IGF-I levels
  during the treatment compared with patients without mutations (86 +/- 67 and 202
  +/- 93 microg/liter, respectively; P = 0.03). hGH treatment significantly improved
  growth velocity in both groups, with slightly better results observed in patients
  without mutations. This was translated into greater gains in height sd score relation
  to baseline during the 3 yr of treatment in patients without mutations (+1.7 +/-
  0.1) compared with those with mutations (+0.8 +/- 0.4; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our
  findings suggest that the presence of PTPN11 mutations in patients with NS indicates
  a reduced growth response to long-term hGH treatment.'
