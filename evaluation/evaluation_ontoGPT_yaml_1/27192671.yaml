input_text: 'Danazol Treatment for Telomere Diseases. BACKGROUND: Genetic defects
  in telomere maintenance and repair cause bone marrow failure, liver cirrhosis, and
  pulmonary fibrosis, and they increase susceptibility to cancer. Historically, androgens
  have been useful as treatment for marrow failure syndromes. In tissue culture and
  animal models, sex hormones regulate expression of the telomerase gene. METHODS:
  In a phase 1-2 prospective study involving patients with telomere diseases, we administered
  the synthetic sex hormone danazol orally at a dose of 800 mg per day for a total
  of 24 months. The goal of treatment was the attenuation of accelerated telomere
  attrition, and the primary efficacy end point was a 20% reduction in the annual
  rate of telomere attrition measured at 24 months. The occurrence of toxic effects
  of treatment was the primary safety end point. Hematologic response to treatment
  at various time points was the secondary efficacy end point. RESULTS: After 27 patients
  were enrolled, the study was halted early, because telomere attrition was reduced
  in all 12 patients who could be evaluated for the primary end point; in the intention-to-treat
  analysis, 12 of 27 patients (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64) met the
  primary efficacy end point. Unexpectedly, almost all the patients (11 of 12, 92%)
  had a gain in telomere length at 24 months as compared with baseline (mean increase,
  386 bp [95% CI, 178 to 593]); in exploratory analyses, similar increases were observed
  at 6 months (16 of 21 patients; mean increase, 175 bp [95% CI, 79 to 271]) and 12
  months (16 of 18 patients; mean increase, 360 bp [95% CI, 209 to 512]). Hematologic
  responses occurred in 19 of 24 patients (79%) who could be evaluated at 3 months
  and in 10 of 12 patients (83%) who could be evaluated at 24 months. Known adverse
  effects of danazol--elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps--of grade 2 or
  less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our
  study, treatment with danazol led to telomere elongation in patients with telomere
  diseases. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number,
  NCT01441037.).'
