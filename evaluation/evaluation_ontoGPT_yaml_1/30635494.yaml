input_text: 'Leukoencephalopathy due to variants in GFPT1-associated congenital myasthenic
  syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular etiology of disease in 4 individuals
  from 2 unrelated families who presented with proximal muscle weakness and features
  suggestive of mitochondrial disease. METHODS: Clinical information and neuroimaging
  were reviewed. Genome sequencing was performed on affected individuals and biological
  parents. RESULTS: All affected individuals presented with muscle weakness and difficulty
  walking. In one family, both children had neonatal respiratory distress while the
  other family had 2 children with episodic deteriorations. In each family, muscle
  biopsy demonstrated ragged red fibers. MRI was suggestive of a mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy,
  with extensive deep cerebral white matter T2 hyperintense signal and selective involvement
  of the middle blade of the corpus callosum. Through genome sequencing, homozygous
  GFPT1 missense variants were identified in the affected individuals of each family.
  The variants detected (p.Arg14Leu and p.Thr151Lys) are absent from population databases
  and predicted to be damaging by in silico prediction tools. Following the genetic
  diagnosis, nerve conduction studies were performed and demonstrated a decremental
  response to repetitive nerve stimulation, confirming the diagnosis of myasthenia.
  Treatment with pyridostigmine was started in one family with favorable response.
  CONCLUSIONS: GFPT1 encodes a widely expressed protein that controls the flux of
  glucose into the hexosamine-biosynthesis pathway that produces precursors for glycosylation
  of proteins. GFPT1 variants and defects in other enzymes of this pathway have previously
  been associated with congenital myasthenia. These findings identify leukoencephalopathy
  as a previously unrecognized phenotype in GFPT1-related disease and suggest that
  mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to this disorder.'
