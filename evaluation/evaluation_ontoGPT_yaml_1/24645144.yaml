input_text: "Epilepsy due to PNPO mutations: genotype, environment and treatment affect
  presentation and outcome. The first described patients with pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate
  oxidase deficiency all had neonatal onset seizures that did not respond to treatment
  with pyridoxine but responded to treatment with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Our data
  suggest, however, that the clinical spectrum of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase
  deficiency is much broader than has been reported in the literature. Sequencing
  of the PNPO gene was undertaken for a cohort of 82 individuals who had shown a reduction
  in frequency and severity of seizures in response to pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.
  Novel sequence changes were studied using a new cell-free expression system and
  a mass spectrometry-based assay for pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase. Three groups
  of patients with PNPO mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified:
  (i) patients with neonatal onset seizures responding to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (n
  = 6); (ii) a patient with infantile spasms (onset 5 months) responsive to pyridoxal
  5'-phosphate (n = 1); and (iii) patients with seizures starting under 3 months of
  age responding to pyridoxine (n = 8). Data suggest that certain genotypes (R225H/C
  and D33V) are more likely to result in seizures that to respond to treatment with
  pyridoxine. Other mutations seem to be associated with infertility, miscarriage
  and prematurity. However, the situation is clearly complex with the same combination
  of mutations being seen in patients who responded and did not respond to pyridoxine.
  It is possible that pyridoxine responsiveness in PNPO deficiency is affected by
  prematurity and age at the time of the therapeutic trial. Other additional factors
  that are likely to influence treatment response and outcome include riboflavin status
  and how well the foetus has been supplied with vitamin B6 by the mother. For some
  patients there was a worsening of symptoms on changing from pyridoxine to pyridoxal
  5'-phosphate. Many of the mutations in PNPO affected residues involved in binding
  flavin mononucleotide or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and many of them showed residual
  enzyme activity. One sequence change (R116Q), predicted to affect flavin mononucleotide
  binding and binding of the two PNPO dimers, and with high residual activity was
  found in Groups (ii) and (iii). This sequence change has been reported in the 1000
  Genomes project suggesting it could be a polymorphism but alternatively it could
  be a common mutation, perhaps responsible for the susceptibility locus for genetic
  generalized epilepsy on 17q21.32 (close to rs72823592). We believe the reduction
  in PNPO activity and B6-responsive epilepsy in the patients reported here indicates
  that it contributes to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. "
