input_text: 'From Clinical Trials to Clinical Practice: Practical Considerations for
  Gene Replacement Therapy in SMA Type 1. Spinal muscular atrophy is a devastating
  neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease that results from survival of motor
  neuron 1 (SMN1) gene mutation or deletion. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy
  type 1 utilizing supportive care, which focuses on symptom management, never sit
  unassisted, and 75% die or require permanent ventilation by age 13.6 months. Onasemnogene
  abeparvovec (Zolgensma, formerly AVXS-101) is a gene replacement therapy comprising
  an adeno-associated viral vector containing the human SMN gene under control of
  the chicken beta-actin promoter. This therapy addresses the genetic root cause of
  the disease by increasing functional SMN protein in motor neurons and preventing
  neuronal cell death, resulting in improved neuronal and muscular function as previously
  demonstrated in transgenic animal models. In an open-label, one-arm, dose-escalation
  phase 1 trial, systemic administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec via a one-time
  infusion over one hour demonstrated improved motor function and survival in all
  infants symptomatic for spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Of the 12 patients who received
  the proposed therapeutic dose, 11 achieved independent sitting, two achieved independent
  standing, and two are able to walk. Most of these 12 patients remained free of respiratory
  supportive care. The only treatment-related adverse event observed was transient
  asymptomatic transaminasemia that resolved with a short course of prednisolone treatment.
  This review discusses the biological rationale underlying gene replacement therapy
  for spinal muscular atrophy, describes the onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trial
  experience, and provides expert recommendations as a reference for the real-world
  use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in clinical practice. As of May 24, 2019, the Food
  and Drug Administration approved onasemnogene abeparvovec, the first gene therapy
  approved to treat children younger than two years with spinal muscular atrophy.'
