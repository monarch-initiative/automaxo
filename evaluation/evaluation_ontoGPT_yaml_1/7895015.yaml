input_text: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. A distinctive clinical
  disorder. The disorder of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy has
  recently been identified, and is now delineated in detail. A phenotypically homogeneous
  group of five families from Australia, Britain and Canada, containing 47 affected
  individuals, was studied. The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning
  six generations. This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor
  seizures, with hyperkinetic or tonic manifestations. Subjects often experienced
  an aura, and remained aware throughout the attacks. Seizures occurred in clusters
  (mean eight attacks/night) typically as the individual dozed, or shortly before
  awakening. The epilepsy usually began in childhood, and persisted through adult
  life, with considerable intra-family variation in severity. Seizures were often
  misdiagnosed as benign nocturnal parasomnias, psychiatric and medical disorders.
  Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful. Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks
  were partial seizures with frontal lobe seizure semiology. Neuro-imaging was normal.
  Carbamazepine monotherapy was frequently effective. This disorder showed autosomal
  dominant inheritance. Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis,
  appropriate therapy and genetic counselling. Moreover, this disorder now offers
  an opportunity to identify a gene for partial epilepsy.
