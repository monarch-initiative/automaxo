input_text: Treatment of MPS VII (Sly disease) by allogeneic BMT in a female with
  homozygous A619V mutation. A 12-year-old girl with Sly disease (mucopolysaccharidosis
  VII; beta-glucuronidase deficiency), who is homozygous for the A619V mutation, had
  a successful allogeneic BMT, donored by an HLA-identical unrelated female to replace
  the deficient enzyme. Within 5 months after BMT, the enzyme activity of the recipient's
  lymphocytes increased to normal range. No signs of acute or chronic GVHD were observed.
  For the successive 31 months post-BMT, beta-glucuronidase activity in her lymphocytes
  was maintained at almost normal levels and excretion of glycosaminoglycans in the
  urine was greatly diminished. Ultrastructural findings demonstrated no abnormal
  vacuoles and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of her rectal mucosal cells. Coincident
  with the restoration of the enzyme activity, clinical improvement was dramatic.
  Especially notable were improvements in motor function. The patient was able to
  walk alone for a long time without aid, and she even became able to ride a bicycle
  and take a bath. In addition, recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract
  and the middle ears decreased in frequency and severity, and dyspnea on exertion,
  severe snoring and vertigo have substantially improved. Thus, allogeneic BMT in
  this patient produced a better quality of life and provided a more promising outlook.
