input_text: Treatment of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with bone marrow
  transplantation from HLA genetically nonidentical donors. Familial hemophagocytic
  lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare genetic disorder associated with the onset early
  in life of overwhelming activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages invariably leading
  to death. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical related
  donor is the treatment of choice in patients with this disease. However, fewer than
  20% of patients have a disease-free HLA-identical sibling. BMT from HLA-nonidentical
  related donors has previously met with poor results, with graft rejection a major
  obstacle in all cases. We describe BMTs from HLA-nonidentical related donors (n
  = 13) and from a matched unrelated donor (n = 1) performed in two centers in 14
  consecutive cases of FHL. Remission of disease was achieved before BMT in 10 patients.
  Marrow was T-cell-depleted to minimize graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antiadhesion
  antibodies specific for the alpha chain of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1
  (LFA-1, CD11a) and the CD2 molecules were infused pre-BMT and post-BMT to help prevent
  graft rejection, in addition to a conditioning regimen of busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide
  (CP), and etoposide (VP16) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Sustained engraftment
  was obtained in 11 of 17 transplants (3 patients had 2 transplants) and disease-free
  survival in 9 patients with a follow-up period of 8 to 69 months (mean, 33). Acute
  GVHD greater than stage I was not observed, and 1 patient had mild cutaneous chronic
  GVHD that resolved. Toxicity due to the BMT procedure was low. Results obtained
  using this protocol are promising in terms of engraftment and event-free survival
  within the limitations of the small sample. We conclude that an immunologic approach
  in terms of drugs used to obtain disease remission and a conditioning regimen that
  includes antiadhesion molecules in T-cell-depleted BMT from HLA genetically nonidentical
  donors is an alternative treatment that warrants further study in FHL patients who
  lack a suitable HLA genetically identical donor.
