input_text: Defective expression of p56lck in an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency.Severe
  combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by profound
  defects in cellular and humoral immunity. We report here an infant with clinical
  and laboratory features of SCID and selective CD4 lymphopenia and lack of CD28 expression
  on CD8(+) T cells. T cells from this patient showed poor blastogenic responses to
  various mitogens and IL-2. Other T cell antigen receptor- induced responses, including
  upregulation of CD69, were similarly inhibited. However, more proximal T cell antigen
  receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation,
  phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase, and calcium mobilization were
  intact. Although p59fyn and ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinases were expressed at normal
  levels, a marked decrease in the level of p56lck was noted. Furthermore, this decrease
  was associated with the presence of an alternatively spliced lck transcript lacking
  the exon 7 kinase encoding domain. These data suggest that a deficiency in p56lck
  expression can produce a SCID phenotype in humans.
