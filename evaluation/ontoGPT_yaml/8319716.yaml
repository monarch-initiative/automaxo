input_text: "Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency: early diagnosis and management
  of a new case.We present a new case of holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiency,
  a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, causing the \"early-onset\" form
  of multiple carboxylase deficiency. The patient was born at term of healthy consanguineous
  parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy. On the 2nd day of life she refused oral
  feeding, became tachydyspnoeic and showed excessive weight loss. Laboratory studies
  showed metabolic acidosis, marked lactic acidaemia, hyperammonaemia and increased
  urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 3-methylcrotonylglycine, 3-hydroxpropionic
  acid and methylcitric acid. Peritoneal dialysis combined with oral supplementation
  of biotin (10 mg/day) started on the 3rd day of life resulted in rapid clinical
  recovery and normalisation of biochemical parameters. HCS deficiency was established
  in lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. The activities of all biotin-dependent carboxylases
  were severely decreased in fibroblasts grown in medium with moderate biotin concentration
  (10(-8) mol/l) but normal in a high biotin medium (10(-5) mol/l). Mitochondrial
  carboxylase activities in lymphocytes were 23%-29% of mean normal during therapy
  with 20 mg of biotin/day, with the higher dose of 40 mg/day they were within (3-methylcrotoryl-CoA
  carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase) or slightly below (propionyl-CoA carboxylase)
  the normal range. At the age of 3 years the patient's physical and psychomotor development
  are normal. Early biotin supplementation should be considered in newborns with lactic
  acidosis and organoaciduria until a final diagnosis has been established. Furthermore,
  the required individual dose of biotin has to be carefully evaluated biochemically
  for the individual patient."
