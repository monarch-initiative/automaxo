input_text: 'Lamotrigine and seizure aggravation in severe myoclonic epilepsy. PURPOSE:
  In severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SME), multiple drug-resistant focal and
  generalized seizure types occur. Lamotrigine (LTG), found effective in many generalized
  and partial seizures, has been little used in severe childhood epilepsy syndromes
  with multiple seizure types. We studied the effects of LTG in SME. METHODS: Twenty-one
  patients with SME, aged 2-18 years, were treated with LTG, 20 in add-on and one
  in monotherapy. LTG was started at 0.2-2.5 mg/kg/day and increased to 2.5-12.5 mg/kg/day.
  For each seizure type, excluding atypical absences, >50% variations compared with
  the 2 months preceding LTG were considered indicators of response, also taking into
  account the degree of disability each seizure type produced. RESULTS: LTG induced
  worsening in 17 (80%) patients, no change in three, and improvement in one. There
  was >50% increase in convulsive seizures in eight (40%) of 20 patients. Myoclonic
  seizures worsened in six (33%) of 18 patients. Of five patients improving in at
  least one seizure type, four had concomitant worsening of more invalidating seizures.
  Clear-cut worsening appeared within 3 months in most patients but was insidious
  in some. LTG was suspended in 19 patients after 15 days-5 years (mean, 14 months)
  with consequent improvement in 18. CONCLUSIONS: The pronounced seizure deterioration
  during LTG treatment was not attributable to the natural course of the disease and
  could be a direct effect of therapeutic LTG doses. LTG treatment seems inappropriate
  in SME.'
