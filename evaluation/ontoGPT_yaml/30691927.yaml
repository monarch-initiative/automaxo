input_text: 'Recessive GM3 synthase deficiency: Natural history, biochemistry, and
  therapeutic frontier.GM3 synthase, encoded by ST3GAL5, initiates synthesis of all
  downstream cerebral gangliosides. Here, we present biochemical, functional, and
  natural history data from 50 individuals homozygous for a pathogenic ST3GAL5 c.862C>T
  founder allele (median age 8.1, range 0.7-30.5 years). GM3 and its derivatives were
  undetectable in plasma. Weight and head circumference were normal at birth and mean
  Apgar scores were 7.7 +- 2.0 (1 min) and 8.9 +- 0.5 (5 min). Somatic growth failure,
  progressive microcephaly, global developmental delay, visual inattentiveness, and
  dyskinetic movements developed within a few months of life. Infantile-onset epileptic
  encephalopathy was characterized by a slow, disorganized, high-voltage background,
  poor state transitions, absent posterior rhythm, and spike trains from multiple
  independent cortical foci; >90% of electrographic seizures were clinically silent.
  Hearing loss affected cochlea and central auditory pathways and 76% of children
  tested failed the newborn hearing screen. Development stagnated early in life; only
  13 (26%) patients sat independently (median age 30 months), three (6%) learned to
  crawl, and none achieved reciprocal communication. Incessant irritability, often
  accompanied by insomnia, began during infancy and contributed to high parental stress.
  Despite catastrophic neurological dysfunction, neuroimaging showed only subtle or
  no destructive changes into late childhood and hospitalizations were surprisingly
  rare (0.2 per patient per year). Median survival was 23.5 years. Our observations
  corroborate findings from transgenic mice which indicate that gangliosides might
  have a limited role in embryonic neurodevelopment but become vital for postnatal
  brain growth and function. These results have critical implications for the design
  and implementation of ganglioside restitution therapies.'
