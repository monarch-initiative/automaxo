A particularly severe subgroup first described in 1894, and subsequently called diseaseC537111, is characterized by progressive diseaseC537111, diseaseD006319 and diseaseD012131. There has been no treatment for this progressive diseaseD019636, which leads to diseaseD012131 and usually diseaseD003643 during childhood. We recently reported the identification of ncbi79581, encoding riboflavin transporter ncbi79581, as a new causative gene for diseaseC537111. We used both exome and Sanger sequencing to identify ncbi79581 mutations in 9606 presenting with diseaseD003389 and diseaseC537197 with or without diseaseD012131. We undertook clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical characterization of 9606 with mutations in ncbi79581, functionally analysed the most prevalent mutations and initiated a regimen of high-dose oral chemicalD012256. We identified 18 9606 from 13 families with compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in ncbi79581. Affected individuals share a core phenotype of rapidly progressive diseaseC537197 (manifesting with diseaseD001259, severe diseaseD018908 upper limbs diseaseC537791 with distinctly preserved strength of the lower limbs), diseaseD034381, diseaseD009896 and diseaseD012131. We demonstrate that ncbi79581 mutations cause reduced chemicalD012256 uptake and reduced riboflavin transporter protein expression, and we report the response to high-dose oral chemicalD012256 therapy in 9606 with ncbi79581 mutations, including significant and sustained clinical and biochemical improvements in two 9606 and preliminary clinical response data in 13 9606 with associated biochemical improvements in 10 9606. The clinical and biochemical responses of this ncbi79581-specific cohort suggest that chemicalD012256 supplementation can ameliorate the progression of this diseaseD019636, particularly when initiated soon after the onset of symptoms.

Our data suggest, however, that the clinical spectrum of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase deficiency is much broader than has been reported in the literature. Sequencing of the ncbi55163 gene was undertaken for a cohort of 82 individuals who had shown a reduction in frequency and severity of diseaseD012640 in response to chemicalD011736 or chemicalD011732. Novel sequence changes were studied using a new cell-free expression system and a mass spectrometry-based assay for ncbi55163. Three groups of 9606 with ncbi55163 mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified: (i) 9606 with neonatal onset diseaseD012640 responding to chemicalD011732 (n = 6); (ii) a 9606 with diseaseD013036 (onset 5 months) responsive to chemicalD011732 (n = 1); and (iii) 9606 with diseaseD012640 starting under 3 months of age responding to chemicalD011736 (n = 8). Data suggest that certain genotypes (variantrs550423482## and variantrs370243877##) are more likely to result in diseaseD012640 that to respond to treatment with chemicalD011736. Other mutations seem to be associated with diseaseD007246, diseaseD000022 and diseaseC536271. However, the situation is clearly complex with the same combination of mutations being seen in 9606 who responded and did not respond to chemicalD011736. It is possible that chemicalD011736 responsiveness in diseaseC566449 is affected by diseaseC536271 and age at the time of the therapeutic trial. Other additional factors that are likely to influence treatment response and outcome include chemicalD012256 status and how well the foetus has been supplied with chemicalD025101 by the mother. For some 9606 there was a worsening of symptoms on changing from chemicalD011736 to chemicalD011732. Many of the mutations in ncbi55163 affected residues involved in binding chemicalD005486 or chemicalD011732 and many of them showed residual enzyme activity. One sequence change (variantrs17679445##), predicted to affect chemicalD005486 binding and binding of the two ncbi55163 dimers, and with high residual activity was found in Groups (ii) and (iii). This sequence change has been reported in the 1000 Genomes project suggesting it could be a polymorphism but alternatively it could be a common mutation, perhaps responsible for the susceptibility locus for genetic diseaseD004829 on 17q21.32 (close to variantrs72823592##). We believe the reduction in ncbi55163 activity and B6-responsive diseaseD004827 in the 9606 reported here indicates that it contributes to the pathogenesis of diseaseD004827.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical related donor is the treatment of choice in 9606 with this disease. However, fewer than 20% of 9606 have a disease-free HLA-identical sibling. BMT from HLA-nonidentical related donors has previously met with poor results, with graft rejection a major obstacle in all cases. We describe BMTs from HLA-nonidentical related donors (n = 13) and from a matched unrelated donor (n = 1) performed in two centers in 14 consecutive cases of diseaseD051359. Remission of disease was achieved before BMT in 10 9606. Marrow was T-cell-depleted to minimize diseaseD006086 (diseaseD006086). Antiadhesion antibodies specific for the alpha chain of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (ncbi3683, ncbi3683) and the ncbi914 molecules were infused pre-BMT and post-BMT to help prevent graft rejection, in addition to a conditioning regimen of chemicalD002066 (chemicalD002066), chemicalD003520 (CP), and chemicalD005047 (chemicalD005047) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Sustained engraftment was obtained in 11 of 17 transplants (3 9606 had 2 transplants) and disease-free survival in 9 9606 with a follow-up period of 8 to 69 months (mean, 33). Acute diseaseD006086 greater than stage I was not observed, and 1 9606 had mild cutaneous chronic diseaseD006086 that resolved. diseaseD064420 due to the BMT procedure was low. Results obtained using this protocol are promising in terms of engraftment and event-free survival within the limitations of the small sample. We conclude that an immunologic approach in terms of drugs used to obtain disease remission and a conditioning regimen that includes antiadhesion molecules in T-cell-depleted BMT from HLA genetically nonidentical donors is an alternative treatment that warrants further study in diseaseD051359 9606 who lack a suitable HLA genetically identical donor.
36992422	Association|diseaseD017086|ncbi3043; Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi3043	Gene Therapy for diseaseD006453: From Discovery to Clinical Trials.Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as 9606 gene delivery tools in 9606 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the ncbi3043 gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent diseaseD006453: diseaseD000755 and diseaseD017086, both affecting functional ncbi3043 chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most 9606) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the 9606's own HSPCs, broadening access to more 9606. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for diseaseD017086 (Zynteglo ). This review illuminates the ncbi3043 gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the ncbi3043 locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both diseaseD000755 and diseaseD017086.

The 9606 was born at term of healthy consanguineous parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy. On the 2nd day of life she refused oral feeding, became tachydyspnoeic and showed excessive diseaseD015431. Laboratory studies showed diseaseD000138, marked diseaseC565446, hyperammonaemia and increased urinary excretion of chemicalC004961, chemicalC002163, 3-hydroxpropionic acid and chemicalC031605. Peritoneal dialysis combined with oral supplementation of chemicalD001710 (10 mg/day) started on the 3rd day of life resulted in rapid clinical recovery and normalisation of biochemical parameters. diseaseD028922 was established in lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. The activities of all biotin-dependent carboxylases were severely decreased in fibroblasts grown in medium with moderate chemicalD001710 concentration (10(-8) mol/l) but normal in a high chemicalD001710 medium (10(-5) mol/l). Mitochondrial carboxylase activities in lymphocytes were 23%-29% of mean normal during therapy with 20 mg of chemicalD001710/day, with the higher dose of 40 mg/day they were within (3-methylcrotoryl-CoA carboxylase, ncbi5091) or slightly below (propionyl-CoA carboxylase) the normal range. At the age of 3 years the 9606's physical and psychomotor development are normal. Early chemicalD001710 supplementation should be considered in newborns with diseaseD000140 and organoaciduria until a final diagnosis has been established. Furthermore, the required individual dose of chemicalD001710 has to be carefully evaluated biochemically for the individual 9606.

Antifibrinolytic agents are increasingly used to reduce diseaseD006470, allogeneic blood administration, and adverse clinical outcomes. chemicalD014148 is the agent most extensively studied and used in most countries. This review will explore the role of fibrinolysis as a pathologic mechanism, review the different pharmacologic agents used to inhibit fibrinolysis, and focus on the role of chemicalD014148 as a therapeutic agent to reduce diseaseD006470 in 9606 after surgery and diseaseD014947.

A distinctive clinical disorder.The disorder of diseaseC579932 has recently been identified, and is now delineated in detail. A phenotypically homogeneous group of five families from Australia, Britain and Canada, containing 47 affected individuals, was studied. The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning six generations. This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor diseaseD012640, with diseaseD006948 or tonic manifestations. Subjects often experienced an aura, and remained aware throughout the attacks. diseaseD012640 occurred in clusters (mean eight attacks/night) typically as the individual dozed, or shortly before awakening. The diseaseD004827 usually began in childhood, and persisted through adult life, with considerable intra-family variation in severity. diseaseD012640 were often misdiagnosed as diseaseD020447, diseaseD001523 and diseaseD000069279. Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful. Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks were partial diseaseD012640 with diseaseD001927 semiology. Neuro-imaging was normal. chemicalD002220 monotherapy was frequently effective. This disorder showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis, appropriate therapy and genetic counselling. Moreover, this disorder now offers an opportunity to identify a gene for diseaseD004828.

15474813		Primary viscocanalostomy versus trabeculectomy for primary diseaseD005902: three-year prospective randomized clinical trial.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in 9606 with primary diseaseD005902 (diseaseD005902). SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial, 50 eyes of 50 9606 with medically uncontrolled diseaseD005902 were randomized to have a trabeculectomy (25 eyes) or a viscocanalostomy (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively. RESULTS: At 3 years, the mean IOP was 16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07 (SD) in the trabeculectomy group and 17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (IOP 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and 55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Qualified success (IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). diseaseD009123 and diseaseD002386 formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in diseaseD005902 9606. However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.

Here, we present biochemical, functional, and natural history data from 50 individuals homozygous for a pathogenic ncbi8869 variantrs104893668## founder allele (median age 8.1, range 0.7-30.5 years). GM3 and its derivatives were undetectable in plasma. Weight and head circumference were normal at birth and mean Apgar scores were 7.7 +- 2.0 (1 min) and 8.9 +- 0.5 (5 min). Somatic diseaseD051437, progressive diseaseD008831, global diseaseD002658, diseaseD001308, and diseaseD004409 developed within a few months of life. Infantile-onset diseaseD001927 was characterized by a slow, disorganized, high-voltage background, poor state transitions, absent posterior rhythm, and spike trains from multiple independent cortical foci; >90% of electrographic diseaseD012640 were clinically silent. diseaseD034381 affected cochlea and central auditory pathways and 76% of children tested failed the newborn hearing screen. Development stagnated early in life; only 13 (26%) 9606 sat independently (median age 30 months), three (6%) learned to crawl, and none achieved reciprocal communication. Incessant diseaseD001523, often accompanied by diseaseD007319, began during infancy and contributed to high parental stress. Despite catastrophic diseaseD009461, neuroimaging showed only subtle or no destructive changes into late childhood and hospitalizations were surprisingly rare (0.2 per 9606 per year). Median survival was 23.5 years. Our observations corroborate findings from transgenic 10090 which indicate that chemicalD005732 might have a limited role in embryonic neurodevelopment but become vital for postnatal brain growth and function. These results have critical implications for the design and implementation of chemicalD005732 restitution therapies.

Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma, formerly AVXS-101) is a gene replacement therapy comprising an adeno-associated viral vector containing the 9606 ncbi6606 gene under control of the 9031 ncbi396526 promoter. This therapy addresses the genetic root cause of the disease by increasing functional ncbi6606 protein in motor neurons and preventing neuronal cell death, resulting in improved neuronal and muscular function as previously demonstrated in transgenic animal models. In an open-label, one-arm, dose-escalation phase 1 trial, systemic administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec via a one-time infusion over one hour demonstrated improved motor function and survival in all infants symptomatic for diseaseD014897. Of the 12 9606 who received the proposed therapeutic dose, 11 achieved independent sitting, two achieved independent standing, and two are able to walk. Most of these 12 9606 remained free of respiratory supportive care. The only treatment-related adverse event observed was transient asymptomatic transaminasemia that resolved with a short course of chemicalD011239 treatment. This review discusses the biological rationale underlying gene replacement therapy for diseaseD009134, describes the onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trial experience, and provides expert recommendations as a reference for the real-world use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in clinical practice. As of May 24, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved onasemnogene abeparvovec, the first gene therapy approved to treat children younger than two years with diseaseD009134.

METHODS: The coding region of ncbi54332 was screened for the presence of mutations in seven families with diseaseD002607 in which the 9606 were homozygous for markers of the ncbi54332 locus at chromosome 8q21.1. RESULTS: A nonsense mutation was detected in exon 5 (variantrs104894075##, variantrs104894075##), a 1-bp deletion in exon 6 (variantrs1060500978##, variant#54332#p.G262fsX284), and a missense mutation in exon 6 (variantrs28937906##, variantrs28937906##). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in ncbi54332 are a frequent cause of diseaseD002607. They result in an early-onset, severe clinical phenotype. The range of nerve conduction velocities (NCV) is variable. Some 9606 have normal or near normal NCV, suggesting an diseaseD020269, whereas others have severely slowed NCV compatible with diseaseD003711. The peripheral nerve biopsy findings are equally variable and show features of diseaseD003711.

Studies suggest that with regard to slowing diseaseD000094628, chemicalD019808 may be more effective than beta-blockers, the current standard therapy in most centers. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial comparing chemicalD019808 with chemicalD001262 in children and young adults with diseaseD008382. The primary outcome was the rate of diseaseD000094628, expressed as the change in the maximum aortic-root-diameter z score indexed to body-surface area (hereafter, aortic-root z score) over a 3-year period. Secondary outcomes included the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic root; the rate of change in diseaseD001022; the time to diseaseD000784, aortic-root surgery, or diseaseD003643; somatic growth; and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: From January 2007 through February 2011, a total of 21 clinical centers enrolled 608 participants, 6 months to 25 years of age (mean [+-SD] age, 11.5+-6.5 years in the chemicalD001262 group and 11.0+-6.2 years in the chemicalD019808 group), who had an aortic-root z score greater than 3.0. The baseline-adjusted rate of change in the mean (+-SE) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the chemicalD001262 group and the chemicalD019808 group (-0.139+-0.013 and -0.107+-0.013 standard-deviation units per year, respectively; P=0.08). Both slopes were significantly less than zero, indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface area with either treatment. The 3-year rates of aortic-root surgery, diseaseD000784, diseaseD003643, and a composite of these events did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and young adults with diseaseD008382 who were randomly assigned to chemicalD019808 or chemicalD001262, we found no significant difference in the rate of aortic-root dilatation between the two treatment groups over a 3-year period.

25292408		Peritoneal Dialysis Can Be an Option for Dominant diseaseD007690: an Observational Study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD016891 (diseaseD016891) has been considered a relative contraindication for peritoneal dialysis (PD), although there are few specific studies available. METHODS: A multicenter historical prospective matched-cohort study was conducted to describe the outcome of diseaseD016891 9606 who have chosen PD. All diseaseD016891 9606 starting PD (n = 106) between January 2003 and December 2010 and a control group (2 consecutive 9606 without diseaseD016891) were studied. diseaseD003643, PD-technique failure, diseaseD010538, diseaseD046449 and diseaseD003560 were compared. RESULTS: 9606 with diseaseD016891 had similar age but less comorbidity at PD inclusion: Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 4.3 (standard deviation [SD] 1.6) vs 5.3 (SD 2.5) p < 0.001, diseaseD003920 5.7% vs 29.2%, p < 0.001 and previous cardiovascular events 10.4% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001. No differences were observed in clinical events that required transient transfer to hemodialysis, nor in peritoneal leakage episodes or delivered dialysis dose. The diseaseD003560 rate was low (0.09 episodes per 9606-year) and diseaseD003560 were not associated to diseaseD010538 episodes. Overall technique survival was similar in both groups. Permanent transfer to hemodialysis because of surgery or peritoneal leakage was more frequent in diseaseD016891. More diseaseD016891 9606 were included in the transplant waiting list (69.8 vs 58%, p = 0.04) but mean time to transplantation was similar (2.08 [1.69 - 2.47] years). The diseaseD003643 rate was lower (2.5 vs 7.6 diseaseD003643/100 9606-year, p = 0.02) and the median 9606 survival was longer in diseaseD016891 9606 (6.04 [5.39 - 6.69] vs 5.57 [4.95 - 6.18] years, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis is a suitable renal replacement therapy option for diseaseD016891 9606.

METHODS: Cross-modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 ncbi56997 9606, including genotype-phenotype correlations, 3D-protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, disease progression, and chemicalC024989 response data. RESULTS: Fifty-nine 9606 (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic ncbi56997 variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling and in vitro analysis of purified variants. diseaseD001259 presented as variable multisystemic, early-onset diseaseD002524, with complicating features ranging from diseaseD004827 (32%) and diseaseD003072 (49%) to diseaseD000092202 intolerance (25%) and diseaseD006948 (41%), including diseaseD004421 and diseaseD009207 as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss-of-function variants (82-93% vs 53%; p = 0.029). diseaseD002526 was universal on MRI (100%), with diseaseD001284 or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross-sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild-to-moderate progression of diseaseD001259 (SARA: 0.45/year). chemicalC024989 treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 9606, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8 of 11 9606 (SARA: -0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that >=48 9606 per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way toward large-scale natural history studies and treatment trials in diseaseD001259.

The BMT successfully put the 9606 in complete remission from his diseaseD009101 and corrected his diseaseD017098. Class-specific IgG anti-ncbi973 antibody that had been identified prior to BMT was no longer detectable in his plasma. diseaseD000707 transfusion reactions were successfully avoided by using a combination of diseaseD017098deficient and washed blood components including the marrow graft, and ncbi973-reduced intravenous immunoglobulin.

Within 5 months after BMT, the enzyme activity of the recipient's lymphocytes increased to normal range. No signs of acute or chronic GVHD were observed. For the successive 31 months post-BMT, ncbi2990 activity in her lymphocytes was maintained at almost normal levels and excretion of chemicalD006025 in the urine was greatly diminished. Ultrastructural findings demonstrated no abnormal vacuoles and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of her rectal mucosal cells. Coincident with the restoration of the enzyme activity, clinical improvement was dramatic. Especially notable were improvements in motor function. The 9606 was able to walk alone for a long time without aid, and she even became able to ride a bicycle and take a bath. In addition, recurrent diseaseD007239 the upper respiratory tract and the middle ears decreased in frequency and severity, and diseaseD004417 on exertion, severe diseaseD012913 and diseaseD014717 have substantially improved. Thus, allogeneic BMT in this 9606 produced a better quality of life and provided a more promising outlook.

Historically, androgens have been useful as treatment for diseaseD000080983. In tissue culture and animal models, sex hormones regulate expression of the telomerase gene. METHODS: In a phase 1-2 prospective study involving 9606 with diseaseC536801, we administered the synthetic sex hormone chemicalD003613 orally at a dose of 800 mg per day for a total of 24 months. The goal of treatment was the attenuation of accelerated telomere attrition, and the primary efficacy end point was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured at 24 months. The occurrence of toxic effects of treatment was the primary safety end point. Hematologic response to treatment at various time points was the secondary efficacy end point. RESULTS: After 27 9606 were enrolled, the study was halted early, because telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 9606 who could be evaluated for the primary end point; in the intention-to-treat analysis, 12 of 27 9606 (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64) met the primary efficacy end point. Unexpectedly, almost all the 9606 (11 of 12, 92%) had a gain in telomere length at 24 months as compared with baseline (mean increase, 386 bp [95% CI, 178 to 593]); in exploratory analyses, similar increases were observed at 6 months (16 of 21 9606; mean increase, 175 bp [95% CI, 79 to 271]) and 12 months (16 of 18 9606; mean increase, 360 bp [95% CI, 209 to 512]). Hematologic responses occurred in 19 of 24 9606 (79%) who could be evaluated at 3 months and in 10 of 12 9606 (83%) who could be evaluated at 24 months. Known adverse effects of chemicalD003613--elevated liver-enzyme levels and diseaseD009120--of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the 9606, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, treatment with chemicalD003613 led to telomere elongation in 9606 with diseaseC536801.

28400115		Thymus transplantation for complete diseaseD004062: European experience.BACKGROUND: Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of athymic complete diseaseD004062 (diseaseD004062). METHODS: Twelve 9606 with diseaseD004062 underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two 9606 died of pre-existing diseaseD014777 without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late diseaseD003643 occurred from diseaseD016553. One infant had diseaseD012772 shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 9606. Median circulating naive ncbi920 counts were 44 x 106/L (range, 11-440 x 106/L) and 200 x 106/L (range, 5-310 x 106/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/106 T cells (range, 320-8,807/106 T cells) and 4,184/106 T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/106 T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but 9606 were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 9606 undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. diseaseD020274 were seen in 7 of 12 9606. In 2 9606 early transient diseaseD006461 settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing diseaseD001327, including diseaseD013966 (3), diseaseD006461 (1), diseaseD013921 (4), and diseaseD009503 (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in 9606 with diseaseD004062 but with frequent diseaseD020274 in survivors.
29478819		A novel Blind Start study design to investigate vestronidase alfa for diseaseD016538, an ultra-rare diseaseD030342.BACKGROUND: Drug development for ultra-rare diseases is challenging because small sample sizes and heterogeneous study populations hamper the ability of randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a single primary endpoint to demonstrate valid treatment effects. METHODS: To overcome these challenges, a novel Blind Start design was utilized in a study of vestronidase alfa in diseaseD016538 (diseaseD016538), an ultra-rare diseaseD016464, that demonstrates the strengths of this approach in a challenging drug-development setting. Twelve subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 blinded groups, each crossing over to active treatment in a blinded fashion at different timepoints with efficacy analysis comparing the last assessment before cross over to after 24 weeks of treatment. Study assessments included: Percentage change from baseline in urinary chemicalD006025 (uGAG); a Multi-Domain Responder Index (MDRI) using prespecified minimal important differences (6-Minute Walk Test, Forced Vital Capacity, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency); diseaseD005221 as assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  Multidimensional diseaseD005221 Scale; and safety. RESULTS: Vestronidase alfa treatment for 24 weeks significantly reduced uGAG excretion (chemicalD003871: 64.8%, p < 0.0001). Most subjects (10/12) had a clinically meaningful improvement in at least one MDRI domain with an overall mean change (+-SD) of +0.5 (+-0.8) at Treatment Week 24 (p = 0.0527). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Blind Start study and MDRI design improve statistical power that enhances detection of a positive treatment effect in this rare heterogeneous disease and could be utilized for other ultra-rare diseases.

20140965		Phenotypic manifestations and management of diseaseC564168, a hereditary diseaseD001848 affecting the calvaria and the diseaseD012888 base.diseaseC564168 is a diseaseD009386 that is characterized by diseaseD010009 and diseaseD010026 the diseaseD012888 base (OMIM 144755). The progressive diseaseD001847 causes diseaseD000160, its first symptoms often presenting during the second decade. This study analyzes the clinical course of 13 affected individuals of three related families (32 individuals). The disorder appears to have an autosomal-dominant transmission pattern. Facial diseaseD000160 are most frequently reported. Surgical decompression of the accessible impaired cranial nerves is advised in the early symptomatic period or even in the presymptomatic period in high-risk individuals.

Mutations in ncbi5781 (ncbi5781) that codify constitutively activated Src homology protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 tyrosine phosphatase and may interfere with ncbi8836 and ncbi3479 signaling were identified in approximately 40% of 9606 with diseaseD009634. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ncbi5781 status on response to 9606 ncbi8836 (hGH) treatment in diseaseD009634 children with diseaseD006130. SETTING: This study was performed at a university hospital. DESIGN: The study design was to conduct a retrospective analysis of 3 yr of hGH treatment and genotyping of ncbi5781 in 9606 with diseaseD009634. 9606: Fourteen diseaseD009634 9606, half of them with ncbi5781 mutations in heterozygous state, were studied. At the beginning of treatment, there were no clinical or laboratory differences between groups with and without mutations in the ncbi5781 gene. INTERVENTION: 9606 were treated with hGH (47 microg/kg.d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were ncbi5781 genotype, change in ncbi3479 levels, and change in height sd score. RESULTS: 9606 with mutations in ncbi5781 presented a significantly smaller increment in ncbi3479 levels during the treatment compared with 9606 without mutations (86 +/- 67 and 202 +/- 93 microg/liter, respectively; P = 0.03). hGH treatment significantly improved growth velocity in both groups, with slightly better results observed in 9606 without mutations. This was translated into greater gains in height sd score relation to baseline during the 3 yr of treatment in 9606 without mutations (+1.7 +/- 0.1) compared with those with mutations (+0.8 +/- 0.4; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the presence of ncbi5781 mutations in 9606 with diseaseD009634 indicates a reduced growth response to long-term hGH treatment.

Many diseaseD020294 (diseaseD020294) are due to mutations of the adult-specific epsilon subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), and, thus, functional deficits do not arise until late in gestation. However, an earlier effect on the fetus might be predicted with some defects of other AChR subunits. We studied a child who presented at birth with diseaseD003286 and was subsequently found to have a diseaseC536089. Mutational screening revealed heteroallelic mutation within the AChR delta subunit gene, delta variant##c.756ins2 and delta variant##p.E59K. Expression studies demonstrate that delta variant##c.756ins2 is a null mutation. By contrast, both fetal and adult AChR containing delta variant##p.E59K have shorter than normal channel activations that predict fast decay of endplate currents. Thus, delta variant##p.E59K causes dysfunction of fetal as well as the adult AChR and would explain the presence of diseaseD003286 on the basis of diseaseD005315. This is the first report of the association of AChR gene mutations with diseaseD001176. It is probable that mutations that severely disrupt function of fetal AChR will underlie additional cases.
3995178		Platelet-associated immunoglobulin, platelet size, and the effect of splenectomy in the diseaseD014923.diseaseD014923 (diseaseD014923) diseaseD013921 is frequently improved by splenectomy, although the mechanism of the diseaseD013921 and its resolution are unknown. Previous studies in two 9606 have shown that mean platelet volume, which is characteristically reduced in diseaseD014923, increased along with platelet count postsplenectomy. Additional studies in a limited number of 9606 have also demonstrated that platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (PAIgG) is elevated presplenectomy, but to date no postsplenectomy data have been reported. The present study was performed to more fully evaluate the effect of splenectomy on platelet volume and PAIgG in diseaseD014923. Before splenectomy, mean platelet volume was reduced but platelet size was broadly distributed with substantial overlap of the normal range. PAIgG was significantly elevated in 13 of 14 presplenectomy diseaseD014923 9606 (means = 78.9 fg per platelet) and fell to normal levels postoperatively (means = 4.0 fg per platelet). Platelet count and clinical status improved postsplenectomy, and mean platelet volume and platelet volume distribution returned to the normal range. diseaseD014923 subjects who relapsed with recurrent diseaseD013921 redeveloped elevated PAIgG but maintained normal platelet size. The spleen appears to play a critical role in a process that may be immunologically mediated and results in reduced platelet size.

We studied 16 new diseaseC538557 9606 focusing on clinical and laboratory features, molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlation, and treatment. These 9606 were classified phenotypically into three groups. The mean cerebrospinal fluid chemicalD005947 concentration was 33.1 +/- 4.9mg/dl equal to 37% of the simultaneous chemicalD001786 concentration. The mean cerebrospinal fluid chemicalD019344 concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.3mM, which was less than the normal mean value of 1.63mM. The mean V(max) for the chemicalD019325 uptake into erythrocytes was 996 fmol/10(6) red blood cells per second, significantly less (54 +/- 11%; t test, p < 0.05) than the mean control value of 1,847. The mean Km value for the 9606 group (1.4 +/- 0.5mM) was similar to the control group (1.7 +/- 0.5mM; t test, p > 0.05). We identified 16 rearrangements, including seven missense, one nonsense, one insertion, and seven deletion mutations. Fourteen were novel mutations. There were no obvious correlations between phenotype, genotype, or biochemical measures. The ketogenic diet produced good diseaseD012640 control.

An increasing number of 9606 are diagnosed in early infancy, but few data are available on the introduction of a ketogenic diet in this age group. diseaseC536830 was suspected in four infants presenting with diseaseD012640 and unexplained hypoglycorrhachia. A ketogenic diet was introduced at 6-28 weeks of age. diseaseD007662 was initiated by fasting, monitored by bedside blood chemicalD005947 and chemicalD020155 determinations, and was maintained successfully using supplemented chemicalD002241-free infant formula and emulgated chemicalD014280. All 9606 developed diseaseD007662 within 24 h. chemicalD020155 concentrations available at the bedside correlated inversely with the base excess. At chemicalD005947 levels < or = 40 mg/dl 9606 remained asymptomatic in the presence of chemicalD007659. The ketogenic formula was tolerated well, parental compliance was good, and all 9606 remained diseaseD012640-free on the diet. diseaseC536830 was confirmed in two 9606; the diet was discontinued in the other two 9606. In one infant, diseaseD005183 on medium-chain chemicalD014280 was effectively reversed using long-chain chemicalD014280. Urine dipstick analyses failed to detect diseaseD007662 in another infant. Adverse effects of the diet were limited to diseaseD007669 in one 9606. The ketogenic diet can be introduced and maintained successfully in young infants using long-chain fat emulsion. Monitoring chemicalD020155 at the bedside was useful for metabolic control and superior to urine dipstick analysis. diseaseD012640 control was effective and adverse effects were limited, but evaluation of the long-term effects of the ketogenic diet in this age group must await ongoing studies.

We report here an infant with clinical and laboratory features of diseaseD016511 and selective ncbi920 diseaseD008231 and lack of ncbi940 expression on ncbi925(+) T cells. T cells from this 9606 showed poor blastogenic responses to various mitogens and ncbi3558. Other T cell antigen receptor- induced responses, including upregulation of ncbi969, were similarly inhibited. However, more proximal T cell antigen receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase, and chemicalD002118 mobilization were intact. Although ncbi2534 and ncbi7535 protein tyrosine kinases were expressed at normal levels, a marked decrease in the level of ncbi3932 was noted. Furthermore, this decrease was associated with the presence of an alternatively spliced ncbi3932 transcript lacking the exon 7 kinase encoding domain. These data suggest that a deficiency in ncbi3932 expression can produce a diseaseD016511 phenotype in 9606.
21067383		Stem-cell gene therapy for the diseaseD014923.The diseaseD014923 (diseaseD014923) is an diseaseD053632 associated with diseaseD013921, diseaseD004485, and diseaseD001327. We treated two 9606 who had this disorder with a transfusion of autologous, genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We found sustained expression of diseaseD014923 protein expression in HSC, lymphoid and myeloid cells, and platelets after gene therapy. T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes were functionally corrected. After treatment, the 9606' clinical condition markedly improved, with resolution of diseaseD006474, diseaseD004485, diseaseD001327, and predisposition to severe diseaseD007239. Comprehensive insertion-site analysis showed vector integration that targeted multiple genes controlling growth and immunologic responses in a persistently polyclonal hematopoiesis.

29716835	Association|chemicalD008358|chemicalD009844	Enzyme replacement therapy with velmanase alfa (9606 recombinant alpha-mannosidase): Novel global treatment response model and outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD008363.diseaseD008363 is an ultra-rare diseaseD009358 resulting from a diseaseD007153 in the lysosomal enzyme diseaseD008363, with a prevalence estimated to be as low as 1:1,000,000 live births. The resulting accumulation of chemicalD008358-rich chemicalD009844 in all tissues leads to a very heterogeneous disorder with a continuum of clinical manifestations with no distinctive phenotypes. Long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with velmanase alfa is approved in Europe for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations in 9606 with mild to moderate diseaseD008363. The clinical heterogeneity and rarity of the disease limit the sensitivity of single parameters to detect clinically relevant treatment effects. Thus, we propose a novel multiple variable responder analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ERT for diseaseD008363 and present efficacy analyses for velmanase alfa using this method. Global treatment response to velmanase alfa (defined by response to >=2 domains comprising pharmacodynamic, functional, and quality of life outcomes) was applied post hoc to data from the pivotal placebo-controlled rhLAMAN-05 study and to the longer-term integrated data from all 9606 in the clinical development program (rhLAMAN-10). After 12 months of treatment, a global treatment response was achieved by 87% of 9606 receiving velmanase alfa (n = 15) compared with 30% of 9606 receiving placebo (n = 10). Longer-term data from all 9606 in the clinical program (n = 33) showed 88% of 9606 were global responders, including all (100%) pediatric 9606 (n = 19) and the majority (71%) of adult 9606 (n = 14). The responder analysis model demonstrates a clinically meaningful treatment effect with velmanase alfa and supports the early initiation and continued benefit of longer-term treatment of all 9606 with diseaseD008363 with this ERT.

Two disease-modifying therapies, chemicalD006918 and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused. OBJECTIVE: To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with diseaseD000755. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists. FINDINGS: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic chemicalD010406 up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with diseaseD000755, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent diseaseD020521 in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (>=200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe diseaseD010146 associated with a diseaseD001752, and use of incentive spirometry in 9606 hospitalized for a diseaseD001752. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of diseaseD010020, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with diseaseD000755. Strong recommendations for children and adults with diseaseD000755 include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of diseaseD006976. chemicalD006918 therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe diseaseD013224 during any 12-month period, with diseaseD000755 or chronic diseaseD000740 interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute diseaseD056586. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with chemicalD006918 without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with diseaseD000755, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess diseaseD019190 is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin chemicalD007501 chelation therapy when indicated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: chemicalD006918 and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with diseaseD000755. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with diseaseD000755.
17018651	Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi2688	ncbi2688 treatment improves growth and clinical status in prepubertal children with diseaseD003550: results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT: This multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover trial of prepubertal children with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) tests the hypotheses that recombinant 9606 ncbi8836 (rhGH) treatment 1) improves height, weight, lean mass, and bone content irrespective of baseline measures; 2) improves clinical status and quality of life; and 3) has continued effect after cessation after 1 yr of treatment. METHODS: Sixty-one prepubertal subjects (<or=25th percentile for height and weight) were randomized into two groups: daily rhGH treatment or no treatment groups for 1 yr. In yr 2, treatments were crossed over. Outcome measures included serial standardized height and weight, number of hospitalizations and antibiotic courses, random blood chemicalD005947 levels, lean mass, bone mineral content, pulmonary function, nutritional intake, and diseaseD003550 quality of life questionnaires. RESULTS: Groups were similar at baseline and prepubertal during the entire study. After 1 yr, ncbi8836 showed significantly greater gain in height, weight, lean mass, and bone mineral content. Gain in height was similar regardless of baseline. There were fewer hospitalizations in the rhGH-treated group and improvement in diseaseD003550 quality of life questionnaires measures of weight and body image. There was no difference in pulmonary function between groups. Results were similar in those treated with rhGH the second year. After cessation of rhGH treatment, there was sustained effect for increased height and weight velocity, as well as accrual of bone mineral. CONCLUSION: rhGH therapy improves height and weight, decreases the number of hospitalizations, and improves quality of life in prepubertal children with diseaseD003550. These effects are sustained after rhGH is discontinued.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report ncbi1175 mutation and effects of low chemicalD002118 formula in a 9606 with diseaseD006934 and diseaseD053565. 9606: This Japanese female infant was found to have diseaseD006934 by a routine laboratory test for poor diseaseD015430 on breast feeding. At 49 days of age, serum chemicalD002118 (adjusted by Payne's formula) was 13.1 mg/dL, intact ncbi5741 27 pg/mL, and urinary chemicalD002118-to-chemicalD003404 ratio 1.29 mg/mg. There was no evidence for diseaseD006961, ncbi5744-producing diseaseD009369, and chemicalD014807 excess. These data, except for diseaseD053565, appeared to be consistent with defective ncbi846-mediated signaling. With use of low chemicalD002118 formula containing 2.6 mg/dL of chemicalD002118, she showed catch-up growth, and serum chemicalD002118 was decreased, as was urinary chemicalD002118-to-chemicalD003404 ratio. Furthermore, feeding with a mixture of low chemicalD002118 formula and standard formula with a 2:1 ratio maintained serum chemicalD002118 ~12 mg/dL without markedly increasing serum ncbi5741. RESULTS: Although no pathologic mutation was detected in ncbi846 or ncbi2767, a presumably de novo heterozygous mutation (variantrs397514499##), a previously reported causative mutation for diseaseC537147, was identified in ncbi1175 of this 9606. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that lack of diseaseC564578 does not necessarily argue against the presence of ncbi1175 mutations. The early infantile age of this 9606 would have played a certain role in the occurrence of diseaseD053565, and low chemicalD002118 formula is worth attempting in infants with diseaseC537145.
19067349		Umbilical cord blood transplantation for juvenile diseaseD007966.Three siblings with diseaseD007966 underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation at different stages of disease. Neuroimaging, nerve conduction studies, neurological examinations, and neuropsychological examinations were used to measure outcome over 2 years. After transplant, the oldest sibling experienced disease progression. His two siblings had near or total resolution of signal abnormalities on neuroimaging. Their neuropsychological testing remained stable, and nerve conduction studies have shown improvement. These results indicate pretransplantation neurological examinations may be the most significant predictor of outcome after transplant. To our knowledge, this report is the first to document neurological outcome of diseaseD007966 treated by umbilical cord blood transplantation.

METHODS: This prospective, comparative nonrandomized clinical interventional study included 13 9606 with progressive diseaseD008268 with occult, or predominantly occult, subfoveal neovascularization. All 9606 had shown an increase or stabilization of visual acuity after a first intravitreal injection of 25 mg of chemicalD014222. They received a second intravitreal injection of 25 mg of chemicalD014222 3.1 to 18 months after the first injection. Mean +/- SD follow-up time after the second injection was 5.2 +/- 3.6 months (median, 5.3 months). A control group included 24 9606 with diseaseD008268 who did not receive treatment for their diseaseD008268. The main outcome measures were visual acuity and intraocular pressure. RESULTS: In the study group, mean +/- SD visual acuity increased significantly (P =.005 and P =.003, respectively) from 0.17 +/- 0.11 to 0.32 +/- 0.26 and from 0.15 +/- 0.14 to 0.23 +/- 0.19, respectively, after the first and second injections. An increase in visual acuity was found for 10 9606 (77%) after the first and second injections. In the control group, visual acuity did not vary significantly during follow-up (P =.81). The difference in change in visual acuity between the study group and control group was significant (P =.01 [Snellen lines] and P =.05 [logMAR units]). The peak in visual acuity and, in a chronologically parallel manner, the peak in intraocular pressure elevation occurred 2 to 5 months after each injection. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated intravitreal injection of 25 mg of chemicalD014222 may lead to an increase in visual acuity in 9606 with diseaseD008268, with the peak in visual acuity and intraocular pressure elevation occurring about 2 to 5 months after each injection.

11316696	Negative_Correlation|diseaseD009634|ncbi2688	diseaseD006130 in diseaseD009634: response to ncbi2688 therapy.BACKGROUND: ncbi2688 (ncbi2688) has been used to promote growth in both the short and long term in a number of diseaseD057215, including diseaseD014424. As this condition shares many clinical features with diseaseD009634, it would seem logical to treat the latter group with ncbi2688. AIMS: To assess the short and long term response to ncbi2688 therapy in 9606 with diseaseD009634. METHODS: Analysis of 9606 with diseaseD009634 in the Pharmacia & Upjohn International Growth Study (this post-marketing database contains data on the majority of 9606 currently treated with ncbi2688 in the UK). A questionnaire was also sent to participating clinicians. RESULTS: Data on 66 9606 (54 males) were available for study. At the start of ncbi2688 therapy children were short, compared with both normal and diseaseD009634 children. During the first year of ncbi2688 therapy height velocity increased from a mean of 4.9 to 7.2 cm per year. For 9606 treated long term with ncbi2688, mean height SDS increased from -2.9 pretreatment to -2.6 after one year and -2.3 after five years. Of the 10 9606 at near final height, only one had a height above the 3rd centile for normal adults and above the mean for untreated diseaseD009634 9606. The mean increment in final height was 3.1 cm (range -1.1 to 6.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: ncbi2688 therapy in 9606 with diseaseD009634 will improve height velocity in the short term. Longer-term therapy results in a waning of effect; initial indications are that final height is not improved substantially in most 9606.
32792226	Association|diseaseD007966|ncbi410	Safety of intrathecal delivery of recombinant 9606 ncbi410 in children with diseaseD007966: Results from a phase 1/2 clinical trial.BACKGROUND: diseaseD007966 (diseaseD007966) is an diseaseD030342 caused by deficient ncbi410 (ncbi410) activity and characterized by diseaseC538190 that results in severe disability and diseaseD003643. We examined the safety and tolerability of intrathecally delivered recombinant 9606 ncbi410 (rhASA; SHP611, now TAK-611) in children with diseaseD007966 (NCT01510028). Secondary endpoints included change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemicalD013433 and chemicalC019064 levels, and motor function (assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 total score). METHODS: Twenty-four children with diseaseD007966 who experienced symptom onset aged <= 30 months were enrolled. 9606 received rhASA every other week (EOW) for 38 weeks at 10, 30, or 100 mg (cohorts 1-3; n = 6 per cohort), or 100 mg manufactured using a revised process (cohort 4; n = 6). RESULTS: No rhASA-related serious adverse diseaseD002318 (SAEs) were observed; 25% of 9606 experienced an SAE related to the intrathecal device or drug delivery method. Mean CSF chemicalD013433 and chemicalC019064 levels fell to within normal ranges in both 100 mg cohorts following treatment. Although there was a general decline in motor function over time, there was a tendency towards a less pronounced decline in 9606 receiving 100 mg. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal rhASA was generally well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg EOW. These preliminary data support further development of rhASA as a therapy for 9606 with diseaseD007966.

Progress in defining the molecular bases does not often translate into effective treatment. Notable exceptions include certain diseaseD008661 amenable to dietary intervention. ncbi730249 encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in de novo chemicalC030986 biosynthesis. Alternatively, chemicalD011743 can be recycled from chemicalD014529. Exome sequencing in three families identified biallelic ncbi730249 mutations in four children with global diseaseD002658, diseaseD001927, and diseaseD000743 with anisopoikilocytosis. Two died aged 4 and 5 years after a diseaseD019636 course. Supplementation of the two surviving children with oral chemicalD014529 led to immediate cessation of diseaseD012640 in both. A 4-year-old female, previously in a minimally conscious state, began to communicate and walk with assistance after 9 weeks of treatment. A 3-year-old female likewise showed developmental progress. Blood smears normalized and diseaseD000743 resolved. We establish ncbi730249 as a gene confidently implicated in this diseaseD009358, characterized by co-occurrence of global diseaseD002658, diseaseD000743 and diseaseD012640. While the natural disease course can be lethal in early childhood, our findings support the efficacy of chemicalD014529 supplementation, rendering diseaseD007153 a treatable diseaseD009358 and therefore a potential condition for future (genetic) newborn screening.
28237137		diseaseD005901 treatment trends: a review.diseaseD005901 is one of the most common causes of diseaseD001766 worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing. The aim of the present review is to describe the current medical and surgical treatment trends in the management of diseaseD005902. There has been an increase in the availability of diseaseD005901 medications and the use of laser trabeculoplasty over the past decade, with a subsequent decrease in invasive incisional surgery. In addition, a new class of diseaseD005901 procedures, termed microinvasive diseaseD005901 surgery, has emerged, which aims to fill the gap between conservative medical management and more invasive surgery.
15184617	Association|diseaseC536664|ncbi5193	Reinvestigation of diseaseC537358 reveals a diseaseC536664.OBJECTIVE: To determine the enzymatic defect in a 9606 with diseaseD001259, diseaseD004401, diseaseD015352, diseaseD009123, and absent reflexes. The 9606 was previously diagnosed with a presumed diseaseC562818. BACKGROUND: Peroxisomes harbor a variety of metabolic functions, including chemicalD005227 beta-oxidation, chemicalD010742 biosynthesis, chemicalD010831 alpha-oxidation, and chemicalC031345 oxidation. This 9606 was previously described with an isolated peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect caused by a diseaseC562818. This was based on the pattern of accumulating metabolites. METHODS: Measurement of beta-oxidation enzymes, peroxisomal biochemical analysis in body fluids and cultured skin fibroblasts, and DNA analysis of the ncbi5193 gene were performed. RESULTS: An isolated beta-oxidation defect in this 9606 was excluded by measurement of the various beta-oxidation enzymes. The authors found that the 9606 had a diseaseC536664 caused by mutations in the ncbi5193 gene, although all peroxisomal functions in cultured skin fibroblasts were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of clear diseaseD018901 in the 9606's fibroblasts, including a normal peroxisomal localization of ncbi847, implies that even when all peroxisomal functions in fibroblasts are normal, a diseaseC536664 cannot be fully excluded, and further studies may be needed. In addition, the authors' findings imply that there is no longer evidence for the existence of diseaseC562818 as a distinct disease entity.
8790089		Management of diseaseD004479 in a family with diseaseD008382.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of combined pars plana vitrectomy-lensectomy and open-loop anterior chamber lens implantation for the management of diseaseD004479 associated with diseaseD008382. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of 4 consecutive 9606 with diseaseD008382 who underwent combined pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and anterior chamber lens implantation at our institution between August 1994 and July 1995. RESULTS: All 9606 demonstrated postoperative visual acuity of 20/25 or better during an average follow-up period of 6 months (range, 4-9 months). Two 9606 developed pseudophakic diseaseD011681 and required YAG laser iridotomy postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation appears to be an excellent technique for the management of diseaseD004479 associated with diseaseD008382. A bimanual, closed-system endosurgical technique avoids many of the complications previously associated with surgery for diseaseD004479.
21220679	Association|diseaseC536096|ncbi8910	Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the pallidum for diseaseC536096 due to ncbi8910 mutations: a pilot study.OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum in 9606 with diseaseC536096 due to genetically proved diseaseC566367. DESIGN: 9606 with documented diseaseC566367 undergoing bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum were recruited. Standardized assessments of M-D were videorecorded before surgery and 6 to 9 months and 15 to 18 months after surgery, using the diseaseD009069 subscales of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden diseaseD004421 Rating Scale and the Unified diseaseD009207 Rating Scale. The analysis was based on blinded evaluation of the recordings. SETTING: diseaseD009069 unit in a university hospital in Paris. 9606: Five consecutive 9606 with documented diseaseC566367 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: diseaseD009207 and diseaseD004421 scores at follow-up. RESULTS: The median diseaseD009207 score decreased from 76 before surgery (range, 38-116) to 10 at 6 to 9 months after surgery (range, 6-31). The median diseaseD004421 score decreased from 30.0 before surgery (range, 18.5-53.0) to 4.5 after surgery (range, 3.5-16.0). Disability was also improved and symptoms remained stable between the postoperative evaluations. No adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum is safe and highly effective in this homogeneous population of 9606 with diseaseC566367 This therapeutic option should therefore be considered for 9606 with severe, drug-resistant forms of the disorder.

27501770	Association|diseaseD009369|ncbi7157; Association|diseaseD016864|ncbi7157	Biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline ncbi7157 mutation carriers with diseaseD016864: 11 year follow-up of a prospective observational study.BACKGROUND: Carriers of a germline ncbi7157 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing diseaseD009369. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with diseaseD016864 or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these 9606 and additional 9606 who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. METHODS: A clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of ncbi7157 pathogenic variants. After confirmation of ncbi7157 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. 9606 could cross over between groups at any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic diseaseD009369 by surveillance investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a diseaseD009369 diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of ncbi7157 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) 9606 crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic diseaseD009369 have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 9606 who underwent surveillance. Two additional diseaseD009369 were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic diseaseD009369 were diagnosed in 43 (88%) 9606. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed diseaseD009369 were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed diseaseD009369 (p=0 012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 88 8% (95% CI 78 7-100) in the surveillance group and 59 6% (47 2-75 2) in the non-surveillance group (p=0 0132). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early diseaseD009369 detection in individuals with pathogenic ncbi7157 variants is feasible and that early diseaseD009369 detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these 9606 should be considered.

8097803	Association|diseaseD010523|ncbi7276; Association|diseaseC000718787|ncbi7276	Clinical improvement and diseaseC000718787 regression after liver transplantation in diseaseC567782.diseaseD028227 (diseaseD028227) is a fatal diseaseD030342. Progressive diseaseD010523 are associated with neural and visceral deposition of diseaseC000718787, derived most commonly from the Met-30 variant of the plasma protein ncbi7276. We have reported previously that orthotopic liver transplantation causes prompt replacement of variant ncbi7276 by the donor wild-type in the plasma. We now report clinical outcome 1-2 years after transplantation. Three of the first four 9606 have improved general wellbeing, walking ability, and bowel function, and one of them has regained normal bladder and bowel function. There has been little objective improvement in diseaseD010523. The fourth 9606, who had the most severe diseaseD009461 and a complicated postoperative course, has not improved but there has been no further deterioration in contrast to the inexorable progression before transplantation. Quantitative scintigraphy with radiolabelled serum amyloid P component showed diseaseD058225 in all three 9606 studied; in two who were followed serially the deposits regressed after transplantation in association with the clinical improvement. Another diseaseD028227 9606 who was also monitored prospectively for 2 years but who did not undergo transplantation, showed, as expected, progression of diseaseD009422 and increased diseaseD058225. Liver transplantation does therefore have important benefits in diseaseD028227 during the first 2 years after surgery. diseaseD009461 is halted and diseaseD058225 can be mobilised. The best timing and long-term results of the procedure must now be established.

Our aim was to fully characterize a defect in chemicalD001647 synthesis in a 2-week-old African-American girl presenting with diseaseD001778, diseaseD014811, and mild diseaseD002779 and in her sibling, whose liver had been used for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: chemicalD001647 were measured by mass spectrometry in urine, bile, serum, and feces of the 9606 and in urine from the unrelated recipient. RESULTS: Liver biopsy specimens showed diseaseC536394 with giant cell transformation and diseaseD009336; peroxisomes were reduced in number. High concentrations of (25R)3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid in the urine, bile, and serum established a pattern similar to that of diseaseD015211 and identical to the 8496. Serum chemicalD010831 was normal, whereas chemicalC002844 was markedly elevated. Biochemical, MRI, and neurologic findings were inconsistent with a generalized diseaseD018901 and were unique. Analysis of the urine from the recipient of the deceased sibling's liver confirmed the same chemicalD001647 synthetic defect. A deficiency in ncbi23600, which is essential for conversion of (25R)THCA to its 25S-isomer, the substrate to initiate peroxisomal beta-oxidation to primary chemicalD001647, was confirmed by DNA analysis revealing a missense mutation (variantrs121917814##) in the gene encoding this enzyme. Long-term treatment with chemicalD019826 normalized liver enzymes and prevented progression of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This diseaseD030342 further highlights chemicalD001647 synthetic defects as a cause of diseaseD007232.

Two 9606 received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) from matched-related donors, 2 received PBSCs from matched-unrelated donors, and 2 received stem cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) donors. Recipients of matched-related and -unrelated donors received chemicalC024352 and 200 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI); UCB recipients received chemicalD003520 in addition to chemicalC024352 and TBI as conditioning. All 9606 received chemicalD016559 and chemicalD020123 posttransplantation. Five 9606 were alive at a median follow-up of 17.4 months (range, 10-25). All 9606 achieved high levels of donor engraftment in the hematopoietic compartments that were deficient pretransplantation. Adverse events consisted of delayed engraftment in the recipient of a single UCB, GVHD in 4 9606, and immune-mediated diseaseD010198 and diseaseD009404 in the recipient of a double UCB transplantation. Nonmyeloablative HSCT in diseaseD000077428 results in reconstitution of the severely deficient monocyte, B-cell, and NK-cell populations and reversal of the clinical phenotype.

ALG3-diseaseD018981 is a very rare subtype with only 24 cases reported so far. CASE: Here, we report two siblings with diseaseD000013, diseaseD006130, diseaseD008831, intractable diseaseD004827, and diseaseD006391 in the frontal, occipital and lumbosacral regions. RESULTS: We studied two siblings by whole exome sequencing. A pathogenic variant in ncbi10195 (NM_005787.6: variantrs387906273##; variant#10195#) that had been previously associated with diseaseC563844 was identified. Their intractable diseaseD012640 were controlled by ketogenic diet. CONCLUSION: Although prominent findings of diseaseD006130 and diseaseD008831 seen in our 9606 have been extensively reported before, presence of diseaseD006391 is a novel finding that may be used as an indication for ncbi10195-diseaseD018981 diagnosis. Our 9606 are the first reported cases whose intractable diseaseD012640 were controlled with ketogenic diet.

METHOD: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the European Registry and Network for Intoxication type diseaseD008659 (Chafea no. December 1, 2010). RESULTS: Data from 28 ncbi166785 and 95 diseaseC536176 9606 in most cases confirmed by mutation analysis (including 4 new mutations for ncbi166785 and 19 new mutations for diseaseC536176). diseaseD008659 is the predominant symptom leading to diagnosis in both groups. Biochemical disturbances during the first crisis were similar in both groups, as well as the age at diagnosis. Z scores of body height and body weight were similar in both groups at birth, but were significantly lower in the diseaseC536176 group at the time of last visit. Glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in ncbi166785; and as a consequence, diseaseD007676 and related complications were significantly less frequent and renal function could be preserved even in older 9606. diseaseD002493 were predominantly found in the diseaseC536176 subgroup. diseaseC537358 (diseaseC537358) levels in urine and plasma were significantly lower in diseaseC537360 27/28 ncbi166785 9606 were reported to be responsive to chemicalD014805, only 86% of ncbi166785 9606 were treated with i.m. chemicalD006879. In total, 73% of ncbi166785 and 98% of diseaseC536176 9606 followed a calculated diet with amino acid supplements in 27% (ncbi166785) and 69% (diseaseC536176). During the study interval, six 9606 from the diseaseC536176 group died, while all ncbi166785 9606 survived. CONCLUSION: Although similar at first, ncbi166785 9606 respond to chemicalD006879 treatment, subsequently show significantly lower levels of diseaseC537358 and a milder course than diseaseC536176 9606.

The main features are diseaseC000721322, diseaseD009140, and diseaseD006984 despite a lack of exercise and diseaseD006332 leading to diseaseD003643. METHODS AND RESULTS: An  19 Mb critical region on X chromosome was identified through identity-by-descent analysis of 3 affected males. Exome sequencing was conducted on one affected male to identify the disease-causing gene and variant. A splice site variant (variant#2273#c.502-2A>G) in the ncbi2273 gene was highly suspicious among other candidate genes and variants. ncbi2273 is the predominant isoform of ncbi2273 in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Sequencing cDNA showed the splice site variant led to skipping of exons 6 of the ncbi2273 isoform, equivalent to the FHL1C isoform. Targeted analysis showed that this splice site variant cosegregated with disease in the family. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of muscle from the proband showed a significant decrease in protein expression of ncbi2273 Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of different isoforms of ncbi2273 demonstrated that the FHL1C is markedly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the ncbi2273 gene have been reported in disorders with diseaseD006331 but none has the skeletal or facial phenotype seen in 9606 with diseaseC564544. Our data suggest that a novel ncbi2273 splice site variant results in the absence of ncbi2273 and the abundance of FHL1C, which may contribute to the complex and severe phenotype. Mutation screening of the ncbi2273 gene should be considered for 9606 with uncharacterized diseaseD009135 and diseaseD009202.
20091517	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD010649|diseaseD010661	Dietary interventions for diseaseD010661.BACKGROUND: diseaseD010661 is an diseaseD030342 treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid chemicalD010649. The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent diseaseD008607; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a low-chemicalD010649 diet commenced early in life for people with diseaseD010661. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane diseaseD003550 and Genetic diseaseD009358 Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Inborn diseaseD008661 Trials Register: 05 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a low-chemicalD010649 diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with diseaseD010661. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood chemicalD010649 levels were significantly lower in participants with diseaseD010661 following a low-chemicalD010649 diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months -698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) -869.44 to -527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of non-randomised studies have concluded that a low-chemicalD010649 diet is effective in reducing blood chemicalD010649 levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low-chemicalD010649 diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non-randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low-chemicalD010649 diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of diseaseD010661 restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies.

METHODS: Case ascertainment, literature review, comprehensive evaluations, and long-term treatment with chemicalD005442. RESULTS: All 9606 presented with neonatal or early infantile-onset diseaseD001927; other features were diseaseD009123, diseaseD006970, diseaseD004827, diseaseC567034, and accelerated linear growth. EEGs showed burst-suppression, modified diseaseD013036, multifocal spikes, and generalized spike-wave. Five of the 10 9606 are currently alive with age at last follow-up between 18 months and 9.5 years. Treatment with continuous chemicalD005442 was implemented in 2 9606. One 9606, with a milder phenotype, began treatment at age 21 months and has continued for 20 months with improved alertness and less excessive adventitious movements. The second 9606 had a more severe phenotype and was 7 years of age at initiation of chemicalD005442, which was not continued. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseC535407 presents with neonatal or infantile-onset diseaseD001927 including diseaseD006970 and diseaseC567034. A widened phenotypic spectrum is reported as opposed to lethality by 2 years of age. The GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist chemicalD005442 may represent a therapeutic strategy.

These mutations prevent the synthesis of the full-length protein but allow the synthesis of its short isoform, GATA-1s. Experiments in 10090 suggest that GATA-1s supports normal adult megakaryopoiesis, platelet formation and erythropoiesis. Here we report a mutation, variantrs587776455##, in exon 2 of ncbi14460, leading to the synthesis of only the short isoform in seven affected males from two generations of a family. Hematological profiles of affected males demonstrate diseaseD000748, normal platelet counts and diseaseD009503 in most cases. Altogether, data suggest that GATA-1s alone, produced in low or normal levels, is not sufficient to support normal erythropoiesis. Moreover, this is the first study to indicate that a germline splicing mutation does not lead to diseaseD007938 in the absence of other cooperating events, such as diseaseD004314.
