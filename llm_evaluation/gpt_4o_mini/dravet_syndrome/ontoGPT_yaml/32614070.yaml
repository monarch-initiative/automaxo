input_text: Thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients on concurrent cannabidiol and valproic
  acid. In January 2019, a new plant-derived purified cannabidiol preparation, approved
  by the US Food and Drug Administration, became commercially available for patients
  >=2 years old with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Among our patients
  who were prescribed the new cannabidiol formulation, we observed several cases of
  thrombocytopenia and therefore embarked on this study. We conducted a single-center
  systematic chart review of all pediatric patients (<21 years old) who were prescribed
  cannabidiol from January to August 2019. We evaluated salient features of the patients'
  epilepsy syndrome, age, concurrent medications, and surveillance laboratory results
  before and after cannabidiol initiation. Among 87 patients, nine (10%) developed
  thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir range = 17 000-108 000) following initiation of
  cannabidiol. Each of these nine children was on combination therapy of cannabidiol
  with valproic acid. Whereas no children on cannabidiol without valproic acid (0/57)
  developed thrombocytopenia, nine of 23 treated with combination valproic acid and
  cannabidiol developed platelets < 110 000/microL (P < .0001). We report a novel
  and clinically important side effect of thrombocytopenia in one-third of patients
  treated concurrently with cannabidiol and valproic acid. If this finding is confirmed,
  clinicians should perform close monitoring for thrombocytopenia when adding cannabidiol
  to a regimen that includes valproic acid.
