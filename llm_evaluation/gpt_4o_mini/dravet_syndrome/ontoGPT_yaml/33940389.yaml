input_text: 'A phase 1b/2a study of soticlestat as adjunctive therapy in participants
  with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
  safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of soticlestat, a first-in-class cholesterol
  24-hydroxylase inhibitor, in adults with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies
  (DEE). METHODS: The study comprised a 30-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  phase (Part A), followed by a 55-day open-label phase (Part B) (ClinicalTrials.gov
  ID: NCT03166215) . In Part A, patients with DEE and at least one bilateral motor
  seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized 4:1 to receive
  soticlestat or placebo, in addition to their usual antiseizure medication. In Part
  B, all patients received open-label soticlestat. Soticlestat doses were titrated
  according to tolerability to a maximum of 300 mg twice daily (BID). Safety evaluations
  included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Plasma soticlestat
  concentrations were measured at various times for determination of multiple-dose
  pharmacokinetics and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC). Efficacy was assessed by evaluation
  of changes in seizure frequency from baseline. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median
  age, 28.5 years) were enrolled and randomized, and 14 (78 %) completed the study.
  In Part A, TEAEs occurred in 71.4 % of soticlestat-treated patients and 100 % of
  placebo-treated patients. In Part B, the overall incidence of TEAEs was 68.8 %.
  In Part A, TEAEs that occurred in more than one patient in the soticlestat group
  were dysarthria (n = 3, 21.4 %), lethargy (n = 2, 14.3 %), upper respiratory tract
  infection (n = 2, 14.3 %), fatigue (n = 2, 14.3 %), and headache (n = 2, 14.3 %).
  Four patients discontinued treatment because of TEAEs, of whom two reported drug-related
  seizure clusters as serious TEAEs. There were no deaths. Pharmacokinetic analysis
  showed dose-dependent increases in systemic exposure and peak plasma soticlestat
  concentrations. At the end of Part B, the overall mean percent change from baseline
  in plasma 24HC was -80.97 %. Changes from baseline in median seizure frequency were
  +16.71 % and +22.16 % in the soticlestat and placebo groups, respectively, in Part
  A, and -36.38 % in all participants in Part B. CONCLUSION: Soticlestat was well
  tolerated at doses of up to 300 mg BID and was associated with a reduction in median
  seizure frequency over the study duration. Further studies are warranted to assess
  the possible efficacy of soticlestat as adjunctive therapy in patients with DEEs
  such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.'
