input_text: 'Scn8a Antisense Oligonucleotide Is Protective in Mouse Models of SCN8A
  Encephalopathy and Dravet Syndrome. OBJECTIVE: SCN8A encephalopathy is a developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused by de novo gain-of-function mutations
  of sodium channel Nav 1.6 that result in neuronal hyperactivity. Affected individuals
  exhibit early onset drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive
  impairment. This study was carried out to determine whether reducing the abundance
  of the Scn8a transcript with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) would delay seizure
  onset and prolong survival in a mouse model of SCN8A encephalopathy. METHODS: ASO
  treatment was tested in a conditional mouse model with Cre-dependent expression
  of the pathogenic patient SCN8A mutation p.Arg1872Trp (R1872W). This model exhibits
  early onset of seizures, rapid progression, and 100% penetrance. An Scn1a +/- haploinsufficient
  mouse model of Dravet syndrome was also treated. ASO was administered by intracerebroventricular
  injection at postnatal day 2, followed in some cases by stereotactic injection at
  postnatal day 30. RESULTS: We observed a dose-dependent increase in length of survival
  from 15 to 65 days in the Scn8a-R1872W/+ mice treated with ASO. Electroencephalographic
  recordings were normal prior to seizure onset. Weight gain and activity in an open
  field were unaffected, but treated mice were less active in a wheel running assay.
  A single treatment with Scn8a ASO extended survival of Dravet syndrome mice from
  3 weeks to >5 months. INTERPRETATION: Reduction of Scn8a transcript by 25 to 50%
  delayed seizure onset and lethality in mouse models of SCN8A encephalopathy and
  Dravet syndrome. Reduction of SCN8A transcript is a promising approach to treatment
  of intractable childhood epilepsies. Ann Neurol 2020;87:339-346.'
