input_text: 'Gene replacement therapies for inherited disorders of neurotransmission:
  Current progress in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Neurodevelopment
  is a highly organized and complex process involving lasting and often irreversible
  changes in the central nervous system. Inherited disorders of neurotransmission
  (IDNT) are a group of genetic disorders where neurotransmission is primarily affected,
  resulting in abnormal brain development from early life, manifest as neurodevelopmental
  disorders and other chronic conditions. In principle, IDNT (particularly those of
  monogenic causes) are amenable to gene replacement therapy via precise genetic correction.
  However, practical challenges for gene replacement therapy remain major hurdles
  for its translation from bench to bedside. We discuss key considerations for the
  development of gene replacement therapies for IDNT. As an example, we describe our
  ongoing work on gene replacement therapy for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  deficiency, a GABA catabolic disorder.'
