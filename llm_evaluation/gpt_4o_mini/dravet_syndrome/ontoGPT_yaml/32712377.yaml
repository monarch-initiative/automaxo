input_text: 'Efficacy of the ketogenic diet in patients with Dravet syndrome: A meta-analysis.
  PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is an infantile epilepsy syndrome with drug resistant seizures
  and cognitive impairment. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the findings
  of relevant published studies to identify the efficacy of a ketogenic diet in patients
  with Dravet syndrome and their compliance thereof, and to provide useful information
  for clinical practice. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and CNKI databases
  were searched for relevant studies published up to September 25, 2019; the included
  studies were reviewed. Meta-analyses were performed using R software to determine
  the combined efficacy rates and retention rate for the ketogenic diet in patients
  with Dravet syndrome. RESULTS: Seven studies involving 167 patients met the inclusion
  criteria: four were retrospective studies, and three were prospective studies. The
  meta-analysis revealed that 63 %, 60 %, and 47 % of responder patients achieved
  >=50 % seizure reduction at month 3, 6, and 12, respectively. The pooled retention
  rate of the ketogenic diet at month 6 and month 12 was 78 % and 49 %, respectively.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that the ketogenic diet is a treatment
  option for patients with Dravet syndrome. The ketogenic diet is safe and its adverse
  effects are mostly acceptable. However, further investigations, especially high-quality
  controlled trials with large samples, are required.'

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
