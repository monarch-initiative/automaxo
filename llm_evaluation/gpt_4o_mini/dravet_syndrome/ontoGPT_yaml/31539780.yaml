input_text: 'Polygala tenuifolia-Acori tatarinowii herbal pair as an inspiration for
  substituted cinnamic alpha-asaronol esters: Design, synthesis, anticonvulsant activity,
  and inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase study. Inspired by the traditional Chinese
  herbal pair of Polygala tenuifolia-Acori Tatarinowii for treating epilepsy, 33 novel
  substituted cinnamic alpha-asaronol esters and analogues were designed by Combination
  of Traditional Chinese Medicine Molecular Chemistry (CTCMMC) strategy, synthesized
  and tested systematically not only for anticonvulsant activity in three mouse models
  but also for LDH inhibitory activity. Thereinto, 68-70 and 75 displayed excellent
  and broad spectra of anticonvulsant activities with modest ability in preventing
  neuropathic pain, as well as low neurotoxicity. The protective indices of these
  four compounds compared favorably with stiripentol, lacosamide, carbamazepine and
  valproic acid. 68-70 exhibited good LDH1 and LDH5 inhibitory activities with noncompetitive
  inhibition type, and were more potent than stiripentol. Notably, 70, as a representative
  agent, was also shown as a moderately positive allosteric modulator at human alpha1beta2gamma2
  GABAA receptors (EC50 46.3 +- 7.3 muM). Thus, 68-70 were promising candidates for
  developing into anti-epileptic drugs, especially for treatment of refractory epilepsies
  such as Dravet syndrome.'
