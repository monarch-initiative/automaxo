input_text: CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.
  The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop
  mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing
  systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations
  or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short
  palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms
  to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility,
  and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development,
  with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target
  effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of
  CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist
  to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including
  both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this
  review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities
  and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric
  neurological diseases.
