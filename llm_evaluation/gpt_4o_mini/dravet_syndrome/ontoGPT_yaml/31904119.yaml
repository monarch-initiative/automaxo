input_text: 'Dravet syndrome: Treatment options and management of prolonged seizures.
  Over time, with careful delineation of Dravet syndrome, we have gained experience
  in treatments most likely to lead to improvement in seizures, as well as those that
  should be avoided. Sodium valproate, clobazam, stiripentol, and topiramate are all
  medications that may lead to benefit, as well as the ketogenic diet. Bromides may
  be utilized in resistant cases. However, equally important are outlining prompt
  rescue treatment for prolonged seizures and avoidance of precipitants. Newer agents
  including cannabidiol and fenfluramine have been demonstrated to be of benefit in
  clinical trials. We propose an algorithm for management, but appreciate that the
  positioning of newer agents is yet to be established.'
