input_text: 'Interictal autonomic dysfunction. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy is associated
  with autonomic dysfunction. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on measures of
  interictal autonomic function, focusing on heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex
  sensitivity (BRS) and electrodermal activity (EDA). RECENT FINDINGS: Resting HRV,
  BRS and EDA are altered in patients with epilepsy compared with healthy controls.
  A larger body of work is available for HRV compared with BRS and EDA, and points
  to interictal HRV derangements across a wide range of epilepsies, including focal,
  generalized, and combined generalized and focal epilepsies. HRV alterations are
  most pronounced in temporal lobe epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant and
  chronic epilepsies. There are conflicting data on the effect of antiseizure medications
  on measures of interictal autonomic function. However, carbamazepine has been associated
  with decreased HRV. Epilepsy surgery and vagus nerve stimulation do not appear to
  have substantial impact on measures of interictal autonomic function but well designed
  studies are lacking. SUMMARY: Patients with epilepsy, particularly those with longstanding
  uncontrolled seizures, have measurable alterations of resting autonomic function.
  These alterations may be relevant to the increased risk of premature mortality in
  epilepsy, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, which warrants investigation
  in future research.'
