input_text: Scn1a gene reactivation after symptom onset rescues pathological phenotypes
  in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe epileptic encephalopathy
  caused primarily by haploinsufficiency of the SCN1A gene. Repetitive seizures can
  lead to endurable and untreatable neurological deficits. Whether this severe pathology
  is reversible after symptom onset remains unknown. To address this question, we
  generated a Scn1a conditional knock-in mouse model (Scn1a Stop/+) in which Scn1a
  expression can be re-activated on-demand during the mouse lifetime. Scn1a gene disruption
  leads to the development of seizures, often associated with sudden unexpected death
  in epilepsy (SUDEP) and behavioral alterations including hyperactivity, social interaction
  deficits and cognitive impairment starting from the second/third week of age. However,
  we showed that Scn1a gene re-activation when symptoms were already manifested (P30)
  led to a complete rescue of both spontaneous and thermic inducible seizures, marked
  amelioration of behavioral abnormalities and normalization of hippocampal fast-spiking
  interneuron firing. We also identified dramatic gene expression alterations, including
  those associated with astrogliosis in Dravet syndrome mice, that, accordingly, were
  rescued by Scn1a gene expression normalization at P30. Interestingly, regaining
  of Nav1.1 physiological level rescued seizures also in adult Dravet syndrome mice
  (P90) after months of repetitive attacks. Overall, these findings represent a solid
  proof-of-concept highlighting that disease phenotype reversibility can be achieved
  when Scn1a gene activity is efficiently reconstituted in brain cells.
