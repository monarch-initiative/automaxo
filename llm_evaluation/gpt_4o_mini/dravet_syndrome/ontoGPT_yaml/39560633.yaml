input_text: 'WONOEP appraisal: Targeted therapy development for early onset epilepsies.
  The early onset epilepsies encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of
  which result in drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, psychiatric comorbidities,
  and sudden death. Advancement in the widespread use of targeted gene panels as well
  as genome and exome sequencing has facilitated the identification of different causative
  genes in a subset of these patients. The ability to recognize the genetic basis
  of early onset epilepsies continues to improve, with de novo coding variants accounting
  for most of the genetic etiologies identified. Although current disease-specific
  and disease-modifying therapies remain limited, novel precision medicine approaches,
  such as small molecules, cell therapy, and other forms of genetic therapies for
  early onset epilepsies, have created excitement among researchers, clinicians, and
  caregivers. Here, we summarize the main findings of presentations and discussions
  on novel therapeutic strategies for targeted treatment of early onset epilepsies
  that occurred during the Workshop on Neurobiology of Epilepsy (WONOEP XVI, Talloires,
  France, July 2022). The presentations discussed the use of chloride transporter
  inhibitors for neonatal seizures, targeting orexinergic signaling for childhood
  absence epilepsy, targeting energy metabolism in Dravet syndrome, and the role of
  cannabinoid receptor type 2, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cell therapies,
  and RNA-based therapies in early life epilepsies.'
