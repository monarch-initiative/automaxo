input_text: The clinical, economic, and humanistic burden of Dravet syndrome - A systematic
  literature review. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
  with evolving disease course as individuals age. In recent years, the treatment
  landscape of DS has changed considerably, and a comprehensive systematic review
  of the contemporary literature is lacking. Here we synthesized published evidence
  on the occurrence of clinical impacts by age, the economic and humanistic (health-related
  quality-of-life [HRQoL]) burden, and health state utility. We provide an evidence-based,
  contemporary visualization of the clinical manifestations, highlighting that DS
  is not limited to seizures; non-seizure manifestations appear early in life and
  increase over time, contributing significantly to the economic and humanistic burden
  of disease. The primary drivers of HRQoL in DS include seizure severity, cognition,
  and motor and behavioral problems; in turn, these directly affect caregivers through
  the extent of assistance required and consequent impact on activities of daily living.
  Unsurprisingly, costs are driven by seizure-related events, hospitalizations, and
  in-home medical care visits. This systematic review highlights a paucity of longitudinal
  data; most studies meeting inclusion criteria were cross-sectional or had short
  follow-up. Nonetheless, available data illustrate the substantial impact on individuals,
  their families, and healthcare systems and establish the need for novel therapies
  to address the complex spectrum of DS manifestations.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
