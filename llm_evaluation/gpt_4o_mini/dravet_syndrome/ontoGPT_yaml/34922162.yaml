input_text: 'Vaccination and childhood epilepsies. INTRODUCTION: The evidence relating
  vaccination to febrile seizures and epilepsy is evaluated with an emphasis on febrile
  seizures (FS), Dravet syndrome (DS), West syndrome, and other developmental and
  epileptic encephalopathies. METHODS: A systematic literature review using search
  words vaccination/immunization AND febrile seizures/epilepsy/Dravet/epileptic encephalopathy/developmental
  encephalopathy was performed. The role of vaccination as the cause/trigger/aggravation
  factor for FS or epilepsies and preventive measures were analyzed. RESULTS: From
  1428 results, 846 duplicates and 447 irrelevant articles were eliminated; 120 were
  analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that vaccinations cause epilepsy in
  healthy populations. Vaccinations do not cause epileptic encephalopathies but may
  be non-specific triggers to seizures in underlying structural or genetic etiologies.
  The first seizure in DS may be earlier in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients,
  but developmental outcome is similar in both groups. Children with a personal or
  family history of FS or epilepsy should receive all routine vaccinations. This recommendation
  includes DS. The known risks of the infectious diseases prevented by immunization
  are well established. Vaccination should be deferred in case of acute illness. Acellular
  pertussis DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is recommended. The combination of
  certain vaccine types may increase the risk of febrile seizures however the public
  health benefit of separating immunizations has not been proven. Measles-containing
  vaccine should be administered at age 12-15 months. Routine prophylactic antipyretics
  are not indicated, as there is no evidence of decreased FS risk and they can attenuate
  the antibody response following vaccination. Prophylactic measures (preventive antipyretic
  medication) are recommended in DS due to the increased risk of prolonged seizures
  with fever.'
