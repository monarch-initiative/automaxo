input_text: 'Adjunctive Cannabidiol in Patients with Dravet Syndrome: A Systematic
  Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety. BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome (DS)
  is one of the most severe forms of drug-resistant epilepsy and available interventions
  fail to control seizures in most patients. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the first in a new
  class of antiepileptic drugs with a distinctive chemical structure and mechanism
  of action. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of CBD as adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with DS using
  meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled,
  single- or double-blinded trials. Main outcomes included >= 50% reduction in baseline
  convulsive seizure frequency and the incidence of treatment withdrawal and adverse
  events (AEs). Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated
  through the inverse variance method. RESULTS: Three trials were included involving
  359 participants, 228 for CBD and 131 for placebo groups. In all trials, the active
  treatment was a plant-derived pharmaceutical formulation of purified CBD oral solution.
  The pooled RR for 50% response during the treatment was 1.69 (95% CI 1.21-2.36;
  p = 0.002). Across the trials, treatment was discontinued in 20 (9.0%) and 3 (2.3%)
  cases in the add-on CBD and placebo groups, respectively; the RR for CBD withdrawal
  was 3.12 (95% CI 1.07-9.10; p = 0.037). The RR to develop any AE during add-on CBD
  treatment was 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.28; p = 0.561). AEs significantly associated with
  adjunctive CBD were somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and increased serum
  aminotransferases. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive CBD resulted in a greater reduction in
  convulsive seizure frequency than placebo and a higher rate of AEs in patients with
  DS presenting with seizures uncontrolled by concomitant antiepileptic therapy.'
