input_text: 'Transition from pediatric to adult care in a Japanese cohort of childhood-onset
  epilepsy: prevalence of epileptic syndromes and complexity in the transition. AIM:
  We retrospectively examined patients with childhood-onset epilepsy who transitioned
  from pediatric to adult care to reveal the clinical characteristics and evaluate
  the complexity of transitioning. METHODS: The subjects were 220 patients (89 males,
  131 females) who had been treated at our pediatric epilepsy clinic and had transferred
  to adult care between 2014 and 2018 without attending a transition clinic or program.
  The demographic data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The
  ages at transition ranged from 15 to 54 years (median: 27 years old). There were
  91 patients with focal epilepsies (FEs) and 129 patients with generalized epilepsies
  [genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) n = 30, generalized epilepsy of various etiologies
  (GEv) n = 99]. A most frequent epileptic syndrome was temporal lobe epilepsy followed
  by frontal lobe epilepsy in FEs, GTCS only followed by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
  in GGE and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome followed by Dravet syndrome in GEv. At the age
  of transition, a total of 77 of the 96 patients with developmental and epileptic
  encephalopathies (DEE) had pharmacoresistant seizures, which was positively correlated
  with a late transition age (P<=0.05). More than monthly seizures and greater than
  moderate disabilities were noted in 45% and 55% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION:
  The patients with childhood-onset epilepsy transitioned to adult care from the hospital-based
  pediatric epilepsy clinic were characterized by generalized>focal epilepsy, a frequent
  complication of DEE, more than monthly seizures, and worse than moderate intellectual
  disabilities. The complication of DEE made a smooth transition difficult and delayed
  the transition age.'
