input_text: 'The role of vagus nerve stimulation in genetic etiologies of drug-resistant
  epilepsy: a meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affects many
  children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its
  role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The
  authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS
  in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review
  of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to
  investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies
  of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction
  rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity
  and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes.
  A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125
  articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses
  were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS;
  the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41%
  (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but
  these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus.
  In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >=
  90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%).
  Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported
  decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence
  regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy,
  such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome,
  Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly;
  variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The
  authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies
  of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure
  reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure
  reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary
  to better characterize VNS response in these children.'
