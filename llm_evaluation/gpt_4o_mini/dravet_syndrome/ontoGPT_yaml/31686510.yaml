input_text: Pharmacokinetics of Phytocannabinoid Acids and Anticonvulsant Effect of
  Cannabidiolic Acid in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome. Cannabis sativa produces
  a complex mixture of many bioactive molecules including terpenophenolic compounds
  known as phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids come in neutral forms (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
  THC; cannabidiol, CBD; etc.) or as acid precursors, which are dominant in the plant
  (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, THCA; cannabidiolic acid, CBDA; etc.).
  There is increasing interest in unlocking the therapeutic applications of the phytocannabinoid
  acids; however, the present understanding of the basic pharmacology of phytocannabinoid
  acids is limited. Herein the brain and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of CBDA,
  THCA, cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), cannabigerolic
  acid (CBGA), and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) were examined following intraperitoneal
  administration in mice. Next it was examined whether CBDA was anticonvulsant in
  a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1aRX/+ mice). All the phytocannabinoid acids
  investigated were rapidly absorbed with plasma tmax values of between 15 and 45
  min and had relatively short half-lives (<4 h). The brain-plasma ratios for the
  acids were very low at <=0.04. However, when CBDA was administered in an alternate
  Tween 80-based vehicle, it exhibited a brain-plasma ratio of 1.9. The anticonvulsant
  potential of CBDA was examined using this vehicle, and it was found that CBDA significantly
  increased the temperature threshold at which the Scn1aRX/+ mice had a generalized
  tonic-clonic seizure.
