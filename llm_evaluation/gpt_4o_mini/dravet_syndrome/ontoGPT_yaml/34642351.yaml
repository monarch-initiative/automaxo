input_text: Clinical spectrum and the comorbidities of Dravet syndrome in Taiwan and
  the possible molecular mechanisms. Dravet syndrome (DS) is an uncommon epilepsy
  syndrome that may negatively affect the patients and their caregivers. However,
  reliable and valid measures of its impact on caregivers and the characteristics
  of patients with DS in Taiwan are lacking. This study aimed to describe the characteristics
  of patients with DS and concerns of their caregivers and establish a baseline frequency
  of disease characteristics using a cross-sectional survey in Taiwan. We assessed
  the caregivers of patients with DS using an online anonymous questionnaire. The
  seizure frequency decreased with age, although lacking statistical significance.
  Vaccines show no influence on the condition of patients with DS. Our findings revealed
  the highest impact on the domains affecting the caregivers' daily life, including
  additional household tasks, symptom observation, further medical plan, and financial
  issues. Caregivers also expressed concerns regarding the lack of independence/constant
  care, seizure control, speech/communication, and impacts on siblings because of
  long-term care of the patients in parents' absence. Our findings highlight the significant
  effects of caring for a child with DS on the lives of their caregivers in Taiwan;
  these findings will help raise awareness regarding the needs of these families.
  Furthermore, we discussed the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of associated
  comorbidities.
