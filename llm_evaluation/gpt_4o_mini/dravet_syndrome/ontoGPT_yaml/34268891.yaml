input_text: 'Late diagnoses of Dravet syndrome: How many individuals are we missing?
  We report new genetic diagnoses of Dravet syndrome in a group of adults with complex
  epilepsy of unknown cause, under follow-up at a tertiary epilepsy center. Individuals
  with epilepsy and other features of unknown cause from our unit underwent whole-genome
  sequencing through the 100 000 Genomes Project. Virtual gene panels were applied
  to frequency-filtered variants based on phenotype summary. Of 1078 individuals recruited,
  8 (0.74%) were identified to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in SCN1A.
  Variant types were as follows: nonsense (stopgain) in five (62.5%) and missense
  in three (37.5%). Detailed review of childhood history confirmed a phenotype compatible
  with Dravet syndrome. Median age at genetic diagnosis was 44.5 years (range 28-52
  years). Tonic-clonic seizures were ongoing in all despite polytherapy including
  valproate. All had a history of fever sensitivity and myoclonic seizures, which
  were ongoing in two (25%) and three (37.5%) individuals, respectively. Salient features
  of Dravet syndrome may be less apparent in adulthood, making clinical diagnosis
  difficult. Regardless of age, benefits of a genetic diagnosis include access to
  syndrome-specific treatment options, avoidance of harmful drugs, and monitoring
  for common complications.'
