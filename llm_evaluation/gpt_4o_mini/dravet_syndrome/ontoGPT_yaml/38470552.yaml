input_text: 'Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) offers
  an alternative strategy to prevent children from being born with hereditary neurological
  diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes: a retrospective
  study. BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M)
  is now widely used as an effective strategy to prevent various monogenic or chromosomal
  diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, couples with a family
  history of hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous
  system phenotypes and/or carrying the pathogenic genes underwent PGT-M to prevent
  children from inheriting disease-causing gene mutations from their parents and developing
  known genetic diseases. After PGT-M, unaffected (i.e., normal) embryos after genetic
  detection were transferred into the uterus of their corresponding mothers. RESULTS:
  A total of 43 carrier couples with the following hereditary neurological diseases
  or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes underwent PGT-M: Duchenne
  muscular dystrophy (13 families); methylmalonic acidemia (7 families); spinal muscular
  atrophy (5 families); infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and intellectual developmental
  disorder (3 families each); Cockayne syndrome (2 families); Menkes disease, spinocerebellar
  ataxia, glycine encephalopathy with epilepsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, mucopolysaccharidosis,
  Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis, and Dravet syndrome (1 family each). After 53 PGT-M cycles, the final
  transferable embryo rate was 12.45%, the clinical pregnancy rate was 74.19%, and
  the live birth rate was 89.47%; a total of 18 unaffected (i.e., healthy) children
  were born to these families. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of
  PGT-M in preventing children born with hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic
  diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes.'
