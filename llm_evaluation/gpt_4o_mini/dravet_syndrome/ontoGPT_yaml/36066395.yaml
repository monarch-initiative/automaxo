input_text: "Stiripentol add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. BACKGROUND:
  This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2014 and last
  updated in 2020. For nearly 30% of people with epilepsy, current treatments do not
  control seizures. Stiripentol is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that was developed
  in France and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2007 as an
  adjunctive therapy with valproate and clobazam for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol as add-on treatment
  for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are taking AEDs. SEARCH METHODS:
  For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and
  MEDLINE on 28 March 2022. We contacted the manufacturer of stiripentol and epilepsy
  experts to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  Randomised controlled trials of add-on stiripentol in people with drug-resistant
  focal epilepsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently selected
  trials for inclusion and extracted data. We investigated outcomes including 50%
  or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, adverse effects, treatment
  withdrawal and changes in quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of our selection
  criteria, we included no new studies in the present review update. We included only
  one study from the original review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study
  adopted a responder-enriched design and found no clear evidence of a reduction of
  50% or more in seizure frequency (risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval
  (CI) 0.81 to 2.82; low-certainty evidence) and no clear evidence of seizure freedom
  (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) when comparing add-on stiripentol
  with placebo. Stiripentol led to a greater risk of adverse effects considered as
  a whole (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.47; low-certainty evidence). When we considered
  specific adverse effects, CIs were very wide and showed the possibility of substantial
  increases and small reductions in risks of neurological adverse effects (RR 2.65,
  95% CI 0.88 to 8.01; low-certainty evidence). Researchers noted no clear reduction
  in the risk of study withdrawal (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47; low-certainty evidence),
  which was high in both groups (53.3% in placebo group and 35.3% in stiripentol group;
  low-certainty evidence). The external validity of this study was limited because
  only responders to stiripentol (i.e. participants experiencing a decrease in seizure
  frequency of 50% or greater during an open prerandomisation phase compared with
  baseline) were included in the randomised, add-on, placebo-controlled, double-blind
  phase. Furthermore, carry-over and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes
  related to seizure frequency. Very limited information derived from the only included
  study shows that adverse effects considered as a whole may occur more often with
  add-on stiripentol than with add-on placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have found
  no new studies since the last version of this review was published. Hence, we have
  made no changes to the conclusions as presented in previous versions. We can draw
  no conclusions to support the use of stiripentol as add-on treatment for drug-resistant
  focal epilepsy. Additional large, randomised, well-conducted trials are needed."
