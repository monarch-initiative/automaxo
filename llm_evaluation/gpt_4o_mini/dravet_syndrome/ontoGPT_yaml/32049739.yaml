input_text: 'What has been the impact of new drug treatments on epilepsy? PURPOSE
  OF REVIEW: Nearly two dozen antiseizure medications (ASMs) with different mechanisms
  of action have been introduced over the past three decades with the aim of providing
  better efficacy or safety profile than the previous drugs. Several new ASMs with
  improvement on a classic drug family or have novel mechanisms of action have been
  recently approved for epilepsy. The present review explored recent studies or guidelines
  on new agents and discussed the potential impact of these novel treatments on epilepsy
  management and future directions of research. RECENT FINDINGS: Long-term cohort
  studies showed that, collectively, the second-generation did not improve the overall
  prognosis of epilepsy. Individual monotherapy studies showed similar efficacy of
  second-generation (levetiracetam and zonisamide) and third-generation (eslicarbazepine
  acetate and lacosamide) ASMs compared to controlled-release carbamazepine for the
  treatment of focal epilepsy. However, there appears to be no evidence to support
  any second-generation or third-generation ASMs to be as efficacious as valproate
  monotherapy for generalized and unclassified epilepsies. Cannabidiol adjunctive
  treatments were found to be efficacious for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
  Although most newer generation ASMs are less prone to drug-drug interactions, stiripentol
  and cannabidiol can elevate the plasma concentration of N-desmethylclobazam, the
  active metabolite of clobazam. Generally speaking, the second-generation ASMs have
  lower teratogenic risk than the older drugs but there is scant study on neurodevelopmental
  effect of third-generation ASMs. SUMMARY: Although the newer generation ASMs may
  not have improved the overall seizure control they have advantages in terms of drug-drug
  interactions and teratogenicity, and thus offer valuable individualized options
  in the treatment of epilepsy.'
