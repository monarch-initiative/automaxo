input_text: 'The role of new medical treatments for the management of developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathies: Novel concepts and results. Developmental and epileptic
  encephalopathies (DEEs) are among the most challenging of all epilepsies to manage,
  given the exceedingly frequent and often severe seizure types, pharmacoresistance
  to conventional antiseizure medications, and numerous comorbidities. During the
  past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs,
  with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol
  as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible
  antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact
  on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old
  drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The
  evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides
  possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the
  context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this
  review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the
  DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.'
