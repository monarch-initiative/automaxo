  Dravet syndrome: A focus group study of caregivers. Caregivers of individuals with
  intellectual and developmental disabilities and epilepsy such as Dravet syndrome
  (DS) must navigate a complex web of state and community services through the transition
  from child-centered to adult-oriented healthcare. This study examined barriers to
  successful transition from the caregivers' perspective. Primary caregivers of teenagers
  or adults with DS who had contemplated or completed transition to adult care were
  eligible. A three-week, asynchronous, web-based focus group was conducted on Facebook.
  Data were analyzed in an iterative process based on a Grounded Theory approach.
  Participants reviewed findings for accuracy. Transition success was defined by how
  well it ensured adequate care for the child when caregivers became unable to provide
  it. Existing transition programs were described as \"not for our kids.\" All caregivers
  reported that transition programs began too late. Challenges to identifying suitable
  providers were formidable, with 71% of adult patients still being seen by pediatric
  neurologists. Many adult physicians lacked a general knowledge of DS, yet caregivers
  perceived that adult physicians were unwilling to listen to caregivers, and few
  were comfortable accommodating patients with intellectual disabilities and challenging
  behaviors. Community programs often excluded patients with DS, and rural healthcare
  disparities created additional barriers. Analysis produced recommendations for improving
  the transition process including the creation of a certified Transition Navigator
  position in the clinical setting. The limitations of this focus group analysis include
  possible selection bias, but our study identified key issues and pathways to improve
  the transition process for patients with DS and their caregivers."

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
