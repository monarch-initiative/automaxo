input_text: "Long-term results of vagus nerve stimulation in children with Dravet
  syndrome: Time-dependent, delayed antiepileptic effect. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed
  to assess the long-term outcomes of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in children with
  pharmaco-resistant Dravet syndrome (DS). METHODS: We enrolled 22 patients with pharmaco-resistant
  DS who underwent VNS implantation at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2005
  to October 2020. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,
  and 36 months after VNS implantation. Efficacy was measured as the percentage reduction
  in seizure frequency at each follow-up compared with the baseline (pre-implantation)
  values. RESULTS: Median patient age at VNS implantation was 10.0 years (interquartile
  range 7.7-13.3). The median follow-up period was 4.3 years (interquartile range
  3.0-6.5) after VNS implantation. All cases were followed up for >=2 years after
  VNS implantation. Three (13.6 %) patients maintained seizure freedom for >=1 year.
  Among them, one achieved seizure freedom after 30 months of VNS. More than 50 %
  reduction in seizure frequency was observed in 36.4 % (8/22), 54.5 % (12/22), and
  63.2 % (12/19) of the patients at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. The median
  percent reduction in seizure frequency was 18.8 %, 50.6 %, and 60.0 % at 12, 24,
  and 36 months, respectively. Compared with the baseline value, the seizure frequency
  was significantly lower at 24, 30, and 36 months, as well as at the longest follow-up
  period (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The symptom that was mostly associated
  with adverse events was hoarseness (4/22, 18.2 %); however, they had temporary or
  minimal effects on activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate
  that VNS therapy allows long-term, progressive, and time-dependent improvement in
  seizure control for pharmaco-resistant DS. Clinicians should be aware of the delayed
  VNS efficacy over the years and should encourage long-term VNS maintenance by patients."
