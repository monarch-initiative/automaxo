input_text: 'Cannabidiol efficacy independent of clobazam: Meta-analysis of four randomized
  controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) with and without
  concomitant clobazam (CLB) was evaluated in stratified analyses of four large randomized
  controlled trials, two in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and two in Dravet syndrome. METHODS:
  Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex  in the US; Epidyolex  in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day)
  was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial
  regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50%
  responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses
  in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response
  relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive
  statistics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB
  use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction
  in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98;
  P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51
  (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse
  events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common
  in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship
  for CBD and its active metabolite. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate CBD is efficacious
  with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect
  associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of
  CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.'
