input_text: 'Vaccination management in an asymptomatic child with a novel SCN1A variant
  and family history of status epilepticus following vaccination: A case report on
  a potential new direction in personalised medicine. PURPOSE: SCN1A variants cause
  a spectrum of epilepsy syndromes from Dravet Syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy
  of early infancy to the milder disorder of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures
  plus (GEFS+). These genetic epilepsies are associated with increased risk of poor
  outcome including complications of status epilepticus and early mortality. Individualised
  management of young children known to be at increased risk should be considered,
  such as around vaccination management. METHODS: We describe two siblings with a
  novel pathogenic SCN1A variant, their management and clinical outcomes following
  routine childhood vaccinations. RESULTS: The index case who had a family history
  of epilepsy of unknown genetic aetiology, died from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
  following his 12-month vaccinations, in the context of status epilepticus and enterovirus
  71 infection. The sibling of the index case with the same SCN1A variant was subsequently
  managed with prophylactic regular sodium valproate and additional clobazam post
  vaccination to reduce the risk of seizure. She has successfully completed the childhood
  immunisations to 18 months with no seizures and normal neurodevelopmental progress.
  CONCLUSION: As the aetiology of genetic epilepsies is increasingly known in early
  childhood, opportunities to personalise care, minimise risks and optimise outcomes
  are changing. Further research is needed on the risks and benefits of symptomatic
  and preventative management of seizures around vaccinations in young children with
  genetic epilepsies.'
