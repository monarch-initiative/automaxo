input_text: Interneuron-specific dual-AAV SCN1A gene replacement corrects epileptic
  phenotypes in mouse models of Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe
  developmental epileptic encephalopathy marked by treatment-resistant seizures, developmental
  delay, intellectual disability, motor deficits, and a 10 to 20% rate of premature
  death. Most patients with DS harbor loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A,
  which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV)1.1 alpha subunit and has been
  associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Here, we generated a split-intein
  form of SCN1A and used a dual-vector delivery approach to circumvent adeno-associated
  virus (AAV) packaging limitations. In addition, we applied previously developed
  enhancer technology to produce an interneuron-specific gene replacement therapy
  for DS, called DLX2.0-SCN1A. The split-intein SCN1A vectors produced full-length
  NaV1.1 protein, and functional sodium channels were recorded in HEK293 cells in
  vitro. Administration of dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs to wild-type mice produced full-length,
  reconstituted human protein by Western blot and telencephalic interneuron-specific
  and dose-dependent NaV1.1 expression by immunohistochemistry. These vectors also
  conferred strong dose-dependent protection against postnatal mortality and seizures
  in Scn1afl/+;Meox2-Cre and Scn1a+/R613X DS mouse models. Injection of single or
  dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs into wild-type mice did not result in increased mortality,
  weight loss, or gliosis as measured by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, expression
  of SCN1A in all neurons driven by the human SYNAPSIN I promoter caused an adverse
  effect marked by increased mortality in the preweaning period, before disease onset.
  These findings demonstrate proof of concept that interneuron-specific AAV-mediated
  SCN1A gene replacement can rescue DS phenotypes in mouse models and suggest that
  it could be a therapeutic approach for patients with DS.
