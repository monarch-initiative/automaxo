input_text: 'Effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Patients With Dravet Syndrome:
  A Case Series and Meta-Analysis. OBJECTIVE: This case series and meta-analysis aimed
  to determine effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with Dravet
  syndrome (DS). METHODS: All patients with DS and VNS were included in this case
  series. For meta-analysis, a literature search of electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane,
  and Embase was performed. Critical Appraisal Tools were used to evaluate study quality.
  Responder (>50% seizure reduction from baseline) rate was the main outcome, which
  was quantitatively synthesized at specific follow-up points (at least six months).
  Subgroup analyses were conducted based on duration of epilepsy, proportion of males,
  and duration of follow-up. Additionally, cognitive and behavior changes were analyzed
  as secondary outcomes in case series only. RESULTS: Of the case series, two of four
  patients responded. In the meta-analysis, of 1183 studies retrieved in the initial
  search, nine comprising 92 patients were included. The overall responder rate reached
  0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.64). Subgroup analyses were performed.
  The responder rates in groups with duration of epilepsy groups greater than or equal
  to six years and less than six years were 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.61) and 0.65 (95%
  CI 0.47 to 0.82) (P = 0.07). No heterogeneity was found in responder rate in groups
  with different proportion of males (>50%, <=50%) or two groups with different duration
  of follow-up (greater than or equal to three years, less than three years) (P >
  0.1). CONCLUSIONS: VNS was an effective option in patients with DS who failed to
  respond to medications. Patients with short duration of epilepsy (less than six
  years) were prone to respond to VNS.'
