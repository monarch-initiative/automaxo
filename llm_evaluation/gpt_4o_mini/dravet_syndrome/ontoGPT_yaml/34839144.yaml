input_text: 'The impact of Scn1a deficiency and ketogenic diet on the intestinal microbiome:
  A study in a genetic Dravet mouse model. PURPOSE: The gut-brain axis has been discussed
  as a possible factor contributing to ictogenesis and epilepsy. While recent preclinical
  studies have proposed a link between the antiseizure effect of a ketogenic diet
  (KD) and alterations to the gut microbiota, there is a knowledge gap about microbial
  composition as a result of Scn1a genetic deficiency and how this is affected by
  KD in Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A large-scale microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA
  gene sequencing was performed in fecal samples collected from wildtype and Dravet
  mice fed either control diet (CD) or KD. Microbial alterations associated with the
  Dravet phenotype or triggered by KD exposure were identified. RESULTS: The comprehensive
  microbial analysis revealed pronounced alterations in gut microbiota between wildtype
  and Dravet mice. The regulation of Chao index indicated a reduced species richness
  in Dravet mice when compared to wildtype controls. The ratio between Firmicutes
  and Bacteroidetes phyla was increased in mice with the Dravet genotype, therefore
  implying a microbial dysbiosis in these animals. Following the switch to CD or KD,
  several bacteria phyla and genera were regulated in Dravet mice. Interestingly,
  an increased abundance of the Clostridium genus and a decreased abundance of the
  Romboutsia genus showed a significant correlation with the severity of the phenotype
  in Dravet mice. KD increased the abundance of Firmicutes and reduced the abundance
  of Bacteroidetes phyla in Dravet mice. The degree of these microbial alterations
  correlated with the reduction in the frequency and duration of motor seizures in
  these animals. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the comprehensive microbial analysis demonstrated
  pronounced alterations in the gut microbiota with evidence of a gut dysbiosis as
  a consequence of the Scn1a genetic deficiency. Exposure to KD affected the gut microbiome
  in Dravet mice. Interestingly, abundance of selected genera correlated with the
  seizure phenotype of Dravet mice. Future studies investigating the functional relevance
  of disease-associated and KD-triggered changes would be essential to confirm the
  relevance of these findings.'
