input_text: 'Norwegian population-based study of effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation
  in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate
  the long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) compared with epilepsy patients without intellectual
  disability (ID). METHODS: Long-term outcomes from a Norwegian VNS quality registry
  are reported in 105 patients with DEEs (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [LGS] n = 62; Dravet
  n = 16; Rett n = 9; other syndromes n = 18) were compared with 212 epilepsy patients
  without ID, with median follow-up of 88 and 72 months, respectively. Total seizure
  reduction was evaluated at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months. Effect on different seizure
  types was evaluated at baseline and last observation carried forward (LOCF). RESULTS:
  Median monthly seizure frequency at LOCF was reduced by 42.2% (p < 0.001) in patients
  with DEE and by 55.8% (p < 0.001) in patients without ID. In DEE patients, >=50%
  seizure reduction at 6 and 24 months were 17.1% and 37.1%, respectively, and 33.5%
  and 48.6% for patients without ID. Seizure reduction >=75% at 60 months occurred
  in 14.3% of DEE patients and 23.1% of patients without ID. Highest median reduction
  was for atonic seizures, most notably 64.6% for LGS patients. A better effect was
  seen at 2 years among DEE patients with unchanged medication compared with those
  with changed medication (54.5% vs. 35.6% responders, p = 0.078). More DEE patients
  were reported to have greater improvement in ictal or postictal severity (43.8%
  vs. 28.3%, p = 0.006) and alertness (62.9% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001) than patients without
  ID. For both groups, use of the magnet reduced seizure severity. Hoarseness was
  the most common adverse effect in both groups. In addition, DEE patients were frequently
  reported to have sleep disturbance, general discomfort, or abdominal problems. SIGNIFICANCE:
  Our data indicate that VNS is very effective for atonic seizures. Patients without
  ID had best overall seizure reduction, however, patients with DEE had higher retention
  rates probably due to other positive effects. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: DEE refers
  to a group of patients with severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. Many of
  these patients have restricted lifestyles with frequent seizures. VNS is a treatment
  option for patients who do not respond well to medicines, either because of insufficient
  effect or serious adverse effects. Our study shows that VNS is well tolerated in
  this patient group and leads to a reduction in all seizure types, most notably for
  seizures leading to fall. Many patients experience other positive effects like shorter
  and milder seizures, as well as improvement in alertness.'
