However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.",
