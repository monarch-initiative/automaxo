Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",
