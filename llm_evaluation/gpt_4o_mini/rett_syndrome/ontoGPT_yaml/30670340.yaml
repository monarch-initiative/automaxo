input_text: "The effectiveness of music therapy for individuals with Rett syndrome
  and their families. BACKGROUND: Patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) present characteristic
  regression in communication and hand skills, which eventually leads to intellectual
  and physical disability. Moreover, caregivers of patients with RTT face stressors
  related to patients' medical and developmental concerns. Given the indications from
  case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on
  RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. METHODS:
  Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy
  program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive
  music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior
  Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment,
  and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music
  therapy program. RESULTS: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and
  non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition,
  purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly
  improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures.
  Lastly, caregivers in the study group exhibited significantly lower stress following
  the program. CONCLUSION: The 24-week music therapy program was effective in improving
  social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, hand function, and reducing
  seizure frequency among RTT patients. Additionally, music therapy was effective
  in relieving parenting stress, which may help healthcare providers initiate early
  intervention strategies that can prevent parenting stress and reduce the risk of
  depression."
