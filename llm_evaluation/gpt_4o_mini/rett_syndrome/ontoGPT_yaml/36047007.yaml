  devices: A systematic review. AIM: To synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness
  of speech-language teleinterventions delivered via videoconferencing to users of
  augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. METHOD: A systematic literature
  search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021.
  Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or
  clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on
  chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in
  the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case
  Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized
  Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS:
  Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such
  as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the
  inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one
  was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional
  communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention
  and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in
  participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared
  to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability.
  INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show
  great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies
  with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to
  allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER
  ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
  devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients
  reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered
  via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method
  of providing AAC intervention services."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
