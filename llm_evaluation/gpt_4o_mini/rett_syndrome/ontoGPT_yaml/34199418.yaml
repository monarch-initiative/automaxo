input_text: 'Modulation of Serotonin Receptors in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Focus
  on 5-HT7 Receptor. Since neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) influence more than
  3% of children worldwide, there has been intense investigation to understand the
  etiology of disorders and develop treatments. Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole,
  risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and
  can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required
  to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental
  disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment
  process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as
  playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between
  serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder
  (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved
  altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the
  5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is
  suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment
  of NDDs.'
