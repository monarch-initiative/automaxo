input_text: Novel MeCP2 Gene Therapy is Effective in a Multicenter Study using Two
  Mouse Models of Rett Syndrome and is Safe in Non-human Primates. The AAV9 gene therapy
  vector presented in this study is safe in mice and non-human primates and highly
  efficacious without causing overexpression toxicity, a major challenge for clinical
  translation of Rett Syndrome gene therapy vectors to date. Our team designed a new
  truncated methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) promoter allowing widespread expression
  of MeCP2 in mice and non-human primates after a single injection into the cerebrospinal
  fluid without causing overexpression symptoms up to 18 months post injection. Additionally,
  this new vector is highly efficacious at lower doses compared to previous constructs
  as demonstrated in extensive efficacy studies performed by two independent laboratories
  in two different Rett syndrome mouse models carrying either a knockout or one of
  the most frequent human mutations of MeCP2. Overall, data from this multicenter
  study highlights the efficacy and safety of this gene therapy construct, making
  it a promising candidate for first in human studies to treat Rett syndrome.
