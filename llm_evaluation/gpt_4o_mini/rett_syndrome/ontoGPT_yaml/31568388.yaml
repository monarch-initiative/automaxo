input_text: 'Efficacy of an Aquatic Exercise Program for 3 Cases of Rett Syndrome.
  PURPOSE: To examine functional, physiological effects of participating in an aquatic
  exercise program by 3 girls, diagnosed with Rett syndrome (RS), to explore areas
  for possible new research. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: RS is a severe neurodevelopmental
  disorder, which causes multiple disabilities and serious impairments in neuromotor
  and cognitive abilities. Three girls (4, 6, and 7 years), diagnosed stage III RS,
  participated in 20 months of aquatic exercise, with individually tailored, full
  body exercises, progressively targeting functional, cardiorespiratory, muscle, and
  flexibility training. Assessments included resting and exercise heart rates, anthropometric
  measures, functional, clinical aspects, and psychosocial abilities. CONCLUSIONS:
  The participants improved functional ability, mood status, relations with family
  and schoolmates, joint mobility, muscle strength, and endurance during functional
  activities. Periodic evaluation of exercise heart rates averaged an increase in
  intensity of 33% above baseline, indicating cardiorespiratory stimulus. This pilot
  program provides clinical rationale for future studies and clinical interventions
  for RS children.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
