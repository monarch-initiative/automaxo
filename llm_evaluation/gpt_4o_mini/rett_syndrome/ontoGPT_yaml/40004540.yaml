input_text: 'Neuronal Network Activation Induced by Forniceal Deep Brain Stimulation
  in Mice. Background: The fimbria-fornix is a nerve fiber bundle that connects various
  structures of the limbic system in the brain and plays a key role in cognition.
  It has become a major target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat memory impairment
  in both dementia patients and animal models of neurological diseases. Previously,
  we have reported the beneficial memory effects of chronic forniceal DBS in mouse
  models of intellectual disability disorders. In Rett syndrome and CDKL5 deficiency
  disorder models, DBS strengthens hippocampal synaptic plasticity, reduces dentate
  inhibitory transmission or increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis that aids memory.
  However, the underlying neuronal circuitry mechanisms remain unknown. This study
  we explored the neural network circuits involved in forniceal DBS treatment. Methods:
  We used acute forniceal DBS-induced expression of c-Fos, an activity-dependent neuronal
  marker, to map the brain structures functionally connected to the fornix. We also
  evaluated the mouse behavior of locomotion, anxiety, and fear memory after acute
  forniceal DBS treatment. Results: Acute forniceal DBS induces robust activation
  of multiple structures in the limbic system. DBS-induced neuronal activation extends
  beyond hippocampal formation and includes brain structures not directly innervated
  by the fornix. Conclusions: Acute forniceal DBS activates multiple limbic structures
  associated with emotion and memory. The neural circuits revealed here help elucidate
  the neural network effect and pave the way for further research on the mechanism
  by which forniceal DBS induces benefits on cognitive impairments.'
