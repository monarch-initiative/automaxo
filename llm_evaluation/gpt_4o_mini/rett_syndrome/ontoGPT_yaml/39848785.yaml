input_text: Methylmalonic acidaemia masquerading as a neurodegenerative disorder.
  We present the case of a toddler displaying neuroregression post-acute gastroenteritis,
  initially suggesting neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigations showed
  atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus
  evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised
  tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified
  methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis
  and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along
  with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental
  improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age,
  with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome,
  an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the
  diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.
