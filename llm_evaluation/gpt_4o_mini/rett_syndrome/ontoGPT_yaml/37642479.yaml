input_text: "Rett Syndrome-Associated Scoliosis: Analysis of National Trends and Treatment
  Patterns of a Rare Indication for Posterior Instrumented Fusion. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
  database cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. treatment trends and inpatient
  outcomes for children undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for Rett syndrome
  (RTT)-associated scoliosis (RAS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: RTT is a rare, sporadic
  neurodevelopmental disorder presenting in childhood with developmental regression,
  ataxia, and seizures. RAS occurs in 50-80% of cases of RTT, but little is known
  about the case volume and perioperative experience for children undergoing PSF.
  METHODS: Using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes
  in the national Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified children with RTT who underwent
  PSF in 2000-2019. Annual case volumes were analyzed. Clinical characteristics and
  outcomes were compared with those of a cohort of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis
  (NMS). RESULTS: Among 220 patients with RAS, 216 (98.2%) were female (mean age at
  surgery 12.3+-3.3 y). Surgical case incidence steadily increased over 19 years,
  with more RAS admissions in the South (31.4%). Overall, patients with RAS demonstrated
  a higher mean Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (2 vs. 1, P<0.001) and had more
  perioperative complications (41.4% vs. 18%, P<0.001) than patients with NMS. RTT
  diagnosis independently predicted higher odds of any complications (OR 1.98, P<0.001)
  and increased length of stay (OR 1.18, P=0.009) for admissions for PSF. CONCLUSIONS:
  Surgical treatment for RAS is rare but increased over a 19-year period. Cases appear
  to be clustering by region, with the highest proportion in the South. The higher
  Elixhauser Comorbidity Index in RAS patients predicted higher cost, longer hospital
  stay, more complications (particularly respiratory), and more nonroutine discharge
  disposition than in other NMS patients. RTT was independently associated with higher
  odds of complications and longer length of stay. Because RAS cases appear to be
  increasing in number, future study should emphasize methods to reduce morbidity
  and investigate deformity-specific metrics to help better understand this population."
