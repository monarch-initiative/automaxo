input_text: Protocol for the neonatal intracerebroventricular delivery of adeno-associated
  viral vectors for brain restoration of MECP2 for Rett syndrome. Here, we present
  a protocol for neonatal intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of adeno-associated
  viral vectors (AAVs), achieving gene therapy for a Rett syndrome mouse model. We
  describe steps for preparing mouse lines, replacing foster mothers, sex typing,
  and genotyping. We then detail procedures for ICV delivery and validation through
  immunofluorescent and immunoblot techniques. This protocol is also applicable to
  preclinical gene therapy research that targets the neonatal mouse brain for other
  neurodevelopmental disorders. For complete details on the use and execution of this
  protocol, please refer to Yang et al.1.
