input_text: Clinical-grade intranasal NGF fuels neurological and metabolic functions
  of Mecp2-deficient mice. MECP2 deficiency causes a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric
  disorders that can affect both genders. Rett syndrome is the most common and is
  characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase
  in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic
  period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability,
  epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes
  for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain;
  consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain.
  The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together
  with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like
  growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted
  us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro
  studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity
  in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear
  translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade
  NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null
  hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being
  was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the
  Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment
  were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test,
  respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk
  RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the
  protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor
  functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous
  mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms,
  the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased
  research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed
  a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial
  structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's
  ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral
  cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement
  in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a
  non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome
  and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.
