input_text: Treatment with the Bacterial Toxin CNF1 Selectively Rescues Cognitive
  and Brain Mitochondrial Deficits in a Female Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome Carrying
  a MeCP2-Null Mutation. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurological disorder caused
  by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene and a major cause of intellectual disability
  in females. No cure exists for RTT. We previously reported that the behavioural
  phenotype and brain mitochondria dysfunction are widely rescued by a single intracerebroventricular
  injection of the bacterial toxin CNF1 in a RTT mouse model carrying a truncating
  mutation of the MeCP2 gene (MeCP2-308 mice). Given the heterogeneity of MECP2 mutations
  in RTT patients, we tested the CNF1 therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model carrying
  a null mutation (MeCP2-Bird mice). CNF1 selectively rescued cognitive defects, without
  improving other RTT-related behavioural alterations, and restored brain mitochondrial
  respiratory chain complex activity in MeCP2-Bird mice. To shed light on the molecular
  mechanisms underlying the differential CNF1 effects on the behavioural phenotype,
  we compared treatment effects on relevant signalling cascades in the brain of the
  two RTT models. CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308
  hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining
  the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends
  on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential
  therapeutic approaches across RTT models.
