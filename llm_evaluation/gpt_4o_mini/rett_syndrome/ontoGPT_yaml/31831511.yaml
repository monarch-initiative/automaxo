input_text: 'Scoping review of symptoms in children with rare, progressive, life-threatening
  disorders. BACKGROUND: Q3 conditions are progressive, metabolic, neurological or
  chromosomal childhood conditions without a cure. Children with these conditions
  face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians
  and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom
  management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically
  identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children
  with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely
  alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation,
  feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor
  problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions,
  good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life.
  METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and
  CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies
  in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were
  Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous
  sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom
  (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION:
  The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few
  conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence
  is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges
  healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide
  high-quality evidence for the care of these children.'

  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
