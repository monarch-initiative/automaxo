input_text: Measurement of Sedentary Behaviors or "Downtime" in Rett Syndrome. This
  study aimed to validate measures of sedentary time in individuals with Rett syndrome.
  Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL
  accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between
  sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median
  [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship
  between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card
  and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately
  measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement)
  of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted
  for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient
  0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with
  capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise
  component of the activity continuum.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
