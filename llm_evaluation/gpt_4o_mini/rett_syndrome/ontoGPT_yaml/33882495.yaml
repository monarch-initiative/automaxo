input_text: Gene Transfer Therapy for Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Neurodevelopmental
  disorders (NDDs) include a broad spectrum of disorders that disrupt normal brain
  development. Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious
  encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single
  gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review,
  we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing,
  and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities
  in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression
  in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity
  of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available
  to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years,
  there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated
  viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene
  in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity
  for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance
  as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals
  and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of
  AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3
  of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome),
  as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder).
  We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of
  preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies
  for each disease.
