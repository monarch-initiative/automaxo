input_text: "Rett syndrome: Teenagers' and young adults' activities, usage of time
  and responses during an ordinary week - a diary study. Background: Little is known
  about the everyday life of individuals with Rett syndrome.Aim/Objective: To describe
  ten participants' (teenagers/young adults) activities during a period of seven days,
  the time-use, where and with whom the activities were performed and the participants'
  responses in the form of visible/audible reactions during activities.Material and
  method: A time-geographic self-administered diary was filled in by 63 informants
  (parents/support staff) and analysed using the software, DAILY LIFE 2011.Results/Findings:
  The most frequently reported activities were hygiene/toilet, moving around indoors,
  eating and getting dressed. Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical
  health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities,
  daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic
  chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff,
  thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported
  response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions:
  Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming. Improved communication
  between all parties may increase participation and well-being and provide solutions
  for handling unpleasant activities and sedentary time.Significance: A more varied
  range of activities may improve the everyday life for individuals with Rett syndrome."
