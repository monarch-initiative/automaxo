input_text: Dendrimer nanotherapy targeting of glial dysfunction improves inflammation
  and neurobehavioral phenotype in adult female Mecp2-heterozygous mouse model of
  Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by
  mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has
  been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of
  this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation.
  Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous
  female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known
  to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved
  behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased
  global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous
  mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation,
  providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results
  demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious
  than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype
  in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is
  significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal
  phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform
  activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory
  cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the
  phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform
  activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic
  glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant
  Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along
  with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the
  translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.
