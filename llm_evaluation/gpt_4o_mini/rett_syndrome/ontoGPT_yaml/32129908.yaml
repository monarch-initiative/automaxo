input_text: 'Neurophysiological Signatures of Motor Impairment in Patients with Rett
  Syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental
  disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes
  the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated
  alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity
  at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying
  motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary
  motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control
  patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting
  the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta
  burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity
  in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with
  neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase
  of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval
  intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting
  a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment
  of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical
  inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and
  scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that
  can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support
  the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the
  progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.'
