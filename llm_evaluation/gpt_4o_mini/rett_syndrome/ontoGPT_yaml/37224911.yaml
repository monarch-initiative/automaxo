input_text: Photodynamic therapy for intergluteal warts in a child affected by Rett
  syndrome. Genital warts (GWs) are the most common sexually transmitted infections
  worldwide, caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The increasing prevalence of
  GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents
  a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity,
  and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic
  therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral
  warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric
  population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat
  area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an
  X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital
  condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions
  was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult
  lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this
  procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy
  is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side
  effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.
