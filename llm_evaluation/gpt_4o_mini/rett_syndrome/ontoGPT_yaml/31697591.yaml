input_text: "Parental Attitudes Toward Deep Brain Stimulation in Adolescents with
  Treatment-Resistant Conditions. Objective: To examine parent's perceptions of deep
  brain stimulation (DBS) and whether DBS is perceived to be a viable and safe treatment
  for their adolescent child presenting with a severe, treatment-resistant neurological
  or psychiatric condition. Method: Two hundred and seventy-nine parents completed
  an online survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants were presented
  with five vignette scenarios involving adolescents with severe, treatment-resistant
  neurological or psychiatric conditions: Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder,
  epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Parents were then
  asked to evaluate each scenario and rate overall acceptability of using DBS to improve
  their child's core symptoms. Data were collected over a period of 2 weeks in the
  month of October 2018. Results: We found that parents reported favorable impressions
  of DBS regardless of the target condition, especially when greater improvement could
  be assured and when their child had the capacity to assist in the treatment decision-making.
  Parents indicated some reluctance to use DBS when possible safety concerns were
  present. Familiarity with DBS was directly associated with attitudes. Conclusions:
  The findings highlight an overall parental willingness to consider DBS as a treatment
  option for key symptoms of neurological and psychiatric conditions in adolescents."
