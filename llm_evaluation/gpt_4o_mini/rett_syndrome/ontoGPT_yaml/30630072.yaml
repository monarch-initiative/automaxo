input_text: 'Spoken word processing in Rett syndrome: Evidence from event-related
  potentials. This study examined the feasibility of using auditory event-related
  potentials to evaluate spoken word processing during passive listening in girls
  with Rett syndrome (n = 11) and typical peers (n = 33), age 4-12 years. The typical
  group demonstrated the expected pattern of more negative amplitudes within 200-500
  ms in response to words than nonwords at left temporal sites. In participants with
  Rett syndrome, word-nonword differentiation was observed at the right temporal sites.
  More negative left hemisphere amplitudes in response to words were associated (at
  trend level) with better receptive language skills and more adaptive behavior. The
  results indicate that girls with Rett syndrome differentiate known words from novel
  nonwords, but may do so using potentially atypical neural processes. Brain-behavior
  correlations support validity of the proposed neural markers of word processing,
  making passive listening paradigms a promising approach for assessing speech and
  language processing in participants with limited spoken language skills.'
