input_text: 'The New Big Is Small: Leveraging Knowledge from Small Trials for Rare
  Disease Drug Development - Blarcamesine for Rett Syndrome. Big data in drug development
  may not satisfactorily address the demands of precision medicine in a rare disease
  population, making the use of smaller clinical trials necessary. Consequently, the
  use of innovative design and analysis of these clinical trials using model-informed
  approaches have become indispensable. This requires informative exposure-outcome
  analysis, together with formal statistical analysis, which should include the strength
  of evidence for a study outcome. We demonstrate how knowledge can be gained, with
  supporting strength of evidence, from a small (data) clinical trial with a low dose
  of blarcamesine in the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT). Based on a small data paradigm,
  pharmacometrics item response theory modeling and Bayes factor analysis were used
  to show that blarcamesine is efficacious in RTT.'
