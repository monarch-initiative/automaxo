input_text: The Efficacy of a Human-Ready miniMECP2 Gene Therapy in a Pre-Clinical
  Model of Rett Syndrome. Inactivating mutations and the duplication of methyl-CpG
  binding protein 2 (MeCP2), respectively, mediate Rett syndrome (RTT) and MECP2 duplication
  syndrome. These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by
  MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory
  Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary
  adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc)
  in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this
  regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular
  (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration
  at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report
  qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at
  P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102
  improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages.
  TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative
  to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for
  that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS.
  MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain.
  In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated
  controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to
  initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier
  number NCT05606614).
