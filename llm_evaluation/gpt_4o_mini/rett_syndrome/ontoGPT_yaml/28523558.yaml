input_text: Epigenome Editing in the Brain. Epigenome editing aims for an introduction
  or removal of chromatin marks at a defined genomic region using artificial EpiEffectors
  resulting in a modulation of the activity of the targeted functional DNA elements.
  Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such
  as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but
  not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing
  opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system
  and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting
  of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression
  of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus-
  and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control
  of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential
  therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative
  and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated
  genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's
  and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we
  discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting
  disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.
