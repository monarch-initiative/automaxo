input_text: 'Presentation and Management Patterns of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
  in Adults Due to Rare Inherited Neuromuscular Diseases. OBJECTIVE: To describe the
  urologic sequalae of several rare congenital neuromuscular diseases. METHODS: We
  retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018)
  of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select
  rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett
  syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders
  characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist
  at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal
  cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter,
  or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive
  disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord
  and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and
  atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in
  late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have
  been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation
  of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable
  genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development
  followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors.
  Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage
  retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several
  congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when
  these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics
  and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults
  with congenital conditions.'
