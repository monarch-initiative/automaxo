input_text: "Adolescents with Rett syndrome at critical care pathway junctures: Examining
  clinicians' decision to initiate invasive long-term ventilation. BACKGROUND: The
  initiation of invasive long-term ventilation (I-LTV) for an adolescent with Rett
  Syndrome (RTT) involves many serious bioethical considerations. In moving towards
  a more inclusive model of patient participation, transparency surrounding the main
  influencing factors around this decision is important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify
  the main drivers influencing a clinician's decision to support initiation of I-LTV
  for an adolescent with RTT. METHOD: We used an anonymous online vignette-based factorial
  survey. The survey was distributed internationally through eight professional multi-disciplinary
  organisations to reach clinicians working in paediatrics. RESULTS: We analysed 504
  RTT vignettes completed by 246 clinicians using mixed effect regression modelling.
  The main three significant influencing factors identified were: parental agreement
  with the decision to support initiation, the family's support network, and proximity
  to a tertiary care centre. Additional comments from participants focused on family
  support, and the importance of on-going communication with the family. CONCLUSION:
  As the rights of those with disabilities improve and participation of adolescents
  in decision-making becomes more established, effective communications with the family
  around goals of care and particular sensitivity and reflective practice around methods
  of consensus building will likely contribute to a positive decision-making process
  at this difficult time."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
