input_text: 'A Pilot Study Delivering Physiotherapy Support for Rett Syndrome Using
  a Telehealth Framework Suitable for COVID-19 Lockdown. Background: Rett syndrome
  (RTT) is a genetically caused neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe
  disability. We assessed the feasibility of a telehealth program supporting gross
  motor skills in RTT.Methods: Five girls with RTT were assessed and a home-based
  exercise program developed in response to functional goals. Families then participated
  in monthly Skype sessions for 6 months, guided by a physiotherapist to monitor progress
  and adjust the program as necessary. Goal Attainment Scaling was used to evaluate
  progress and a parental satisfaction questionnaire was administered.Results: Four
  goals were established for each participant and progress was greater than would
  be expected in 16 of 20 goals. Parents evaluated the program as feasible and useful
  for their daughters.Discussion: A telehealth model of home-based intervention supported
  individuals with RTT to achieve gross motor skills and was found to be feasible.
  This model is important at present times during COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown.'
