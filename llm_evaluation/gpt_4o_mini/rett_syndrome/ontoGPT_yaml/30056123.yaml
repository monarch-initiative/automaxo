input_text: Chronic treatment with the phytocannabinoid Cannabidivarin (CBDV) rescues
  behavioural alterations and brain atrophy in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Rett
  syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by severe behavioural
  and physiological symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene in about
  95% of cases and to date no cure is available. The endocannabinoid system modulates
  several physiological processes and behavioural responses that are impaired in RTT
  and its deregulation has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders which have
  symptoms in common with RTT. The present study evaluated the potential therapeutic
  efficacy for RTT of cannabidivarin (CBDV), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid from
  Cannabis sativa that presents antagonistic properties on the G protein-coupled receptor
  55 (GPR55), the most recently identified cannabinoid receptor. Present results demonstrate
  that systemic treatment with CBDV (2, 20, 100 mg/Kg ip for 14 days) rescues behavioural
  and brain alterations in MeCP2-308 male mice, a validated RTT model. The CBDV treatment
  restored the compromised general health status, the sociability and the brain weight
  in RTT mice. A partial restoration of motor coordination was also observed. Moreover,
  increased levels of GPR55 were found in RTT mouse hippocampus, suggesting this G
  protein-coupled receptor as new potential target for the treatment of this disorder.
  Present findings highlight for the first time for RTT the translational relevance
  of CBDV, an innovative therapeutic agent that is under active investigation in the
  clinical setting.
