input_text: 'Forniceal deep brain stimulation in a mouse model of Rett syndrome increases
  neurogenesis and hippocampal memory beyond the treatment period. BACKGROUND: Rett
  syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding
  protein 2 (MeCP2), severely impairs learning and memory. We previously showed that
  forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with
  concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse
  model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize
  DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2
  genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS:
  Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix.
  We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different
  time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression
  of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal
  DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks
  was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of
  more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival.
  It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus.
  CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends
  well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation
  of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and
  memory benefits.'
