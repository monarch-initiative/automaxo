input_text: "Long Term Ventilation in Pediatric Central Apnea: Etiologies and Therapeutic
  Approach over a Decade. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to analyze the
  clinical characteristics, ventilatory strategies, and effectiveness of ventilation
  in pediatric patients with central apneas treated at the Sleep Medicine and Long-Term
  Ventilation Unit of the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome from 2012 to 2022.
  METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December
  2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline
  poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying
  disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset,
  ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness
  of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation.
  RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI
  > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine
  syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome,
  8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%);
  other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy,
  lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported
  ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed
  by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous
  positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant
  improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome
  (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01),
  and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant
  improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central
  apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory
  strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield
  significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this
  study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories.
  PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with
  predominantly obstructive sleep apneas."
