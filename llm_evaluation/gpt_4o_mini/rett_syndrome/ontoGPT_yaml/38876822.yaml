input_text: MeCP2 gene therapy ameliorates disease phenotype in mouse model for Pitt
  Hopkins syndrome. The neurodevelopmental disorder Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) causes
  clinical symptoms similar to Rett syndrome (RTT) patients. However, RTT is caused
  by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic
  commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology
  suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed
  patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly,
  we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to
  healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function
  and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically
  crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly
  ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly,
  post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated
  viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly
  improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and
  behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown
  role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple
  neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets
  for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or,
  potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.
