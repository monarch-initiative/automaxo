input_text: "Caregiver- and Clinician-Reported Adaptive Functioning in Rett Syndrome:
  a Systematic Review and Evaluation of Measurement Strategies. Rett syndrome is the
  second most common cause of intellectual disability in females worldwide. The severity
  of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment.
  However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight
  into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature
  assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement
  tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term
  \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes
  in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included.
  Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population
  of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning
  as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living).
  Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning
  relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement
  weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable
  to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are
  highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing
  measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification
  of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions
  aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
