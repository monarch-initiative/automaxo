input_text: 'Experimental Examination and Social Validation of a Microswitch Intervention
  to Improve Choice-Making and Activity Engagement for Six Girls with Rett Syndrome.
  Background: The use of assistive technology, specifically microswitches, with children
  with RTT has been shown to effectively moderate the impact of their disability on
  their quality of life- by facilitating access to meaningful leisure and other activities.
  Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a microswitch intervention
  on increased choice making, engagement in a targeted sorting activity, and indices
  of happiness, and decreased stereotypic behaviors for six girls with Rett syndrome.
  Targeted dependent variables were also assessed at six months post-intervention.
  Following the intervention study, 90 external raters completed a social validation
  procedure. Method: An ABABAB experimental sequence was implemented for each participant
  with a cross-over effect. A social validation assessment involving 90 external raters
  was carried out. Results: Data emphasized an improved performance for each participants
  involved (i.e., adaptive responses). Five participants showed a capacity of independent
  choice. One participant seemed to be closely linked to the position of the container.
  Social raters favorably endorsed the use of the program since they positively evaluated
  the use of the technology on all the dimensions investigated. Conclusion: A microswitch
  intervention may improve choice making and activity engagement for children with
  Rett syndrome. Further research is needed on the development of more sophisticated
  forms of individualized technological options to improve opportunities for enhanced
  engagement and choice-making for individuals with RTT.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
