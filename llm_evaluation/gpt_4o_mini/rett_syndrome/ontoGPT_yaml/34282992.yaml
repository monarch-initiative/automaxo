input_text: "Effects of a remotely supervised motor rehabilitation program for individuals
  with Rett syndrome at home. PURPOSE: In this study, the effect of a remotely supervised,
  home-based, family-centered individualized rehabilitation program of motor activities
  for individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen
  participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program
  of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals
  achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program
  was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls,
  twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%)
  rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly
  increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604).
  Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness
  of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction
  (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs
  for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented
  when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as
  during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA
  remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports
  motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to
  carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The
  program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental
  conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels."
