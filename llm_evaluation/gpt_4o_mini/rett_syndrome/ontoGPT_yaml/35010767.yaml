input_text: 'Comparing Advanced with Basic Telerehabilitation Technologies for Patients
  with Rett Syndrome-A Pilot Study on Behavioral Parameters. The aim of this study
  is to compare the performances of patients with Rett syndrome that were undergoing
  advanced telerehabilitation (ATR) and patients that were undergoing basic telerehabilitation
  (BTR). It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would
  have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities
  that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls
  and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50;
  IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test
  2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with
  three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced
  telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only
  in some neuropsychological measurements. The results are discussed in the light
  of critical factors of telerehabilitation.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
