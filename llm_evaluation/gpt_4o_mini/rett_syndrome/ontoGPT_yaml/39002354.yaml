input_text: 'The Efficacy of Noninvasive Ventilation in Patients Affected by Rett
  Syndrome With Hypoventilation. BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a progressive neurological
  disorder associated to several comorbidities that contribute significantly to impair
  lung function. Respiratory morbidity represents a major cause of death in this population.
  Little is known about the benefit of noninvasive ventilation. METHODS: We retrospectively
  enrolled patients with Rett syndrome who underwent a pneumological evaluation combined
  with a cardiorespiratory polygraphy and/or a pulse oximetry and capnography from
  2012 to 2022. RESULTS: Medical records of 11 patients with Rett syndrome, mean age
  13 +- 6 years, were evaluated. Most patients presented with both epilepsy and scoliosis.
  Five patients showed a pathologic sleep study and/or impaired night gas exchange:
  mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was 4 +- 3 events/hour; mean and minimal SpO2
  were, respectively, 93% +- 2% and 83% +- 6%, while mean and maximal transcutaneous
  carbon dioxide monitoring (PtcCO2) were, respectively, 51 +- 5 mm Hg and 55 +- 8
  mm Hg; and mean oxygen desaturation index was 13 +- 11 events/hour. These patients
  started noninvasive ventilation with clinical benefit and improved gas exchange
  mostly in terms of PtcCO2 (mean PtcCO2 51 +- 5 mm Hg before and 46 +- 6 mm Hg after
  noninvasive ventilation). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive ventilation is a suitable option
  for patients with Rett syndrome.'
