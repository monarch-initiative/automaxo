input_text: Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Non-Viral CRISPR-Cas9 for Enhanced Genome
  Editing to Treat Rett Syndrome. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology has the potential to
  revolutionize the treatment of various diseases, including Rett syndrome, by enabling
  the correction of genes or mutations in human patient cells. However, several challenges
  need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges
  include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of
  the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates.
  Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE)
  platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility,
  and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility
  of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in
  induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a
  Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting,
  MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%)
  with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents
  without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics
  as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE
  and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined
  CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly
  in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.
