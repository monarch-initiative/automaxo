input_text: AAV-mediated FOXG1 gene editing in human Rett primary cells. Variations
  in the Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) gene cause FOXG1 syndrome spectrum, including the
  congenital variant of Rett syndrome, characterized by early onset of regression,
  Rett-like and jerky movements, and cortical visual impairment. Due to the largely
  unknown pathophysiological mechanisms downstream the impairment of this transcriptional
  regulator, a specific treatment is not yet available. Since both haploinsufficiency
  and hyper-expression of FOXG1 cause diseases in humans, we reasoned that adding
  a gene under nonnative regulatory sequences would be a risky strategy as opposed
  to a genome editing approach where the mutated gene is reversed into wild-type.
  Here, we demonstrate that an adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)-coupled CRISPR/Cas9
  system is able to target and correct FOXG1 variants in patient-derived fibroblasts,
  induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons. Variant-specific
  single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and donor DNAs have been selected and cloned together
  with a mCherry/EGFP reporter system. Specific sgRNA recognition sequences were inserted
  upstream and downstream Cas9 CDS to allow self-cleavage and inactivation. We demonstrated
  that AAV serotypes vary in transduction efficiency depending on the target cell
  type, the best being AAV9 in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons, and AAV2 in iPSCs.
  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mCherry+/EGFP+ transfected cells demonstrated
  that the mutated alleles were repaired with high efficiency (20-35% reversion) and
  precision both in terms of allelic discrimination and off-target activity. The genome
  editing strategy tested in this study has proven to precisely repair FOXG1 and delivery
  through an AAV9-based system represents a step forward toward the development of
  a therapy for Rett syndrome.
