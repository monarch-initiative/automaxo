input_text: 'Deciphering MECP2-associated disorders: disrupted circuits and the hope
  for repair. MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication
  of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT)
  and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield
  ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development.
  Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that
  deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic
  mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits
  responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate
  models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions.'
