input_text: 'Effect of presentation rate on auditory processing in Rett syndrome:
  event-related potential study. BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RS) is a rare neurodevelopmental
  disorder characterized by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Patients with RS have severe
  motor abnormalities and are often unable to walk, use hands and speak. The preservation
  of perceptual and cognitive functions is hard to assess, while clinicians and care-givers
  point out that these patients need more time to process information than typically
  developing peers. Neurophysiological correlates of auditory processing have been
  also found to be distorted in RS, but sound presentation rates were relatively quick
  in these studies (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA < 1000 ms). As auditory event-related
  potential (ERP) is typically increased with prolongation of SOA we aim to study
  if SOA prolongation might compensate for observed abnormalities. METHODS: We presented
  a repetitive stimulus (1000 Hz) at three different SOAs of 900 ms, 1800 ms, and
  3600 ms in children with RS (N = 24, Mean age = 9.0 +- 3.1) and their typical development
  (TD) peers (N = 27, Mean age = 9.7 +- 3.4) while recording 28-channels electroencephalogram,
  EEG. Some RS participants (n = 10) did not show clear ERP and were excluded from
  the analysis. RESULTS: Major ERP components (here assessed as N1P1 and P2N1 peak-to-peak
  values) were smaller at SOA 900 than at longer SOAs in both groups, pointing out
  that the basic mechanism of adaptation in the auditory system is preserved in at
  least in RS patients with evident ERPs. At the same time the latencies of these
  components were significantly delayed in the RS than in TD. Moreover, late components
  (P2N1 and N2P2) were drastically reduced in Rett syndrome irrespective of the SOA,
  suggesting a largely affected mechanism of integration of upcoming sensory input
  with memory. Moreover, developmental stagnation of auditory ERP characterized patients
  with RS: absence of typical P2N1 enlargement and P1 and N1 shortening with age at
  least for shortest SOA. LIMITATIONS: We could not figure out the cause for the high
  percentage of no-evident ERP RS participants and our final sample of the RS group
  was rather small. Also, our study did not include a control clinical group. CONCLUSIONS:
  Thus, auditory ERPs inform us about abnormalities within auditory processing that
  cannot be fully overcomed by slowing presentation rate.'
