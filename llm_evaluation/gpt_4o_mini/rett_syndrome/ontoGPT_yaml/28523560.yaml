input_text: Stem Cell Technology for (Epi)genetic Brain Disorders. Despite the enormous
  efforts of the scientific community over the years, effective therapeutics for many
  (epi)genetic brain disorders remain unidentified. The common and persistent failures
  to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed
  to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular
  models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved
  in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of
  satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge
  of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough
  understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress
  in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years,
  however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study
  and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain
  a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro
  that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic
  interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding
  of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders,
  stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing,
  and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In
  the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models
  and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human
  brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's
  disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome
  (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).
