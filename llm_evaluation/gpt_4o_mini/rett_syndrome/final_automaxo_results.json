                    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X chromosome-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the transcription regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2 gene transfer has been shown to extend the survival of Mecp2-/y knockout mice modelling Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less.

Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

This disorder mainly affects females, who typically have seemingly normal early development followed by a regression of acquired skills. The rodent Mecp2 model exhibits many of the classic neural abnormalities and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with Rett syndrome. Similar to individuals with Rett syndrome, both auditory discrimination ability and auditory cortical responses are impaired in heterozygous Mecp2 rats. The development of therapies that can enhance plasticity in auditory networks and improve auditory processing has the potential to impact the lives of individuals with Rett syndrome. Evidence suggests that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with sound presentation can drive robust neuroplasticity in auditory networks and enhance the benefits of auditory therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of VNS paired with tones to restore auditory processing in Mecp2 transgenic rats. METHODS: Seventeen female heterozygous Mecp2 rats and 8 female wild-type (WT) littermates were used in this study. The rats were exposed to multiple tone frequencies paired with VNS 300 times per day for 20 days. Auditory cortex responses were then examined following VNS-tone pairing therapy or no therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that Mecp2 mutation alters auditory cortex responses to sounds compared to WT controls. VNS-tone pairing in Mecp2 rats improves the cortical response strength to both tones and speech sounds compared to untreated Mecp2 rats. Additionally, VNS-tone pairing increased the information contained in the neural response that can be used to discriminate between different consonant sounds.

Music-based interventions improve social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, and physical skills and reduce seizure frequency in patients with RTT. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which music-based interventions compromise sociability impairments in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice as an experimental RTT model. Male mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice and wild-type mice (24 days old) were randomly divided into control, noise, and music-based intervention groups. Mice were exposed to music or noise for 6 h/day for 3 consecutive weeks. Behavioral patterns, including anxiety, spontaneous exploration, and sociability, were characterized using open-field and three-chamber tests. BDNF, TrkB receptor motif, and FNDC5 expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala were probed using RT-PCR or immunoblotting. mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice showed less locomotion in an open field than wild-type mice. The social novelty rather than the sociability of these animals increased following a music-based intervention, suggesting that music influenced the mecp2-deletion-induced social interaction repression rather than motor deficit. Mechanically, the loss of BDNF signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions, but not in the basal ganglia and amygdala, was compromised following the music-based intervention in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice, whereas TrkB signaling was not significantly changed in either region. FNDC5 expression in the prefrontal cortex region in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice also increased following the music-based intervention. Collective evidence reveals that music-based interventions improve mecp2-loss-induced social dysfunction. BDNF and FNDC5 signaling in the prefrontal cortex region mediates the music-based-intervention promotion of social interactions. This study gives new insight into the mechanisms underlying the improvement of social behaviors in mice suffering from experimental Rett syndrome following a music-based intervention.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

In this review, we provide a blueprint for translational precision medicine in ASD and related neurogenetic syndromes. Methods: The discovery of trofinetide for Rett syndrome (RTT) is described, and the role of nonmammalian, mammalian, and stem cell model systems in the identification of molecular targets and drug screening is discussed. We then provide a framework for translating preclinical findings to human clinical trials, including the role of biomarkers in selecting molecular targets and evaluating target engagement, and discuss how to leverage these findings for future ASD drug development. Results: Multiple preclinical model systems for ASD have been developed, each with tradeoffs with regard to suitability for high-throughput small molecule screening, conservation across species, and behavioral face validity. Future clinical trials should incorporate biomarkers and intermediate phenotypes to demonstrate target engagement. Factors that contributed to the approval of trofinetide for RTT included replicated findings in mouse models, a well-studied natural history of the syndrome, development of RTT-specific outcome measures, and strong engagement of the RTT family community. Conclusions: The translation of our growing understanding of the neurobiology of ASD to human drug discovery will require a precision medicine approach, including the use of multiple model systems for molecular target selection, evaluation of target engagement, and clinical trial design strategies that address heterogeneity, power, and the placebo response.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily caused by mutations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

We previously showed that forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria, initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group, respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however, further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.",

Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria, initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group, respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however, further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.",

In this review, we provide a blueprint for translational precision medicine in ASD and related neurogenetic syndromes. Methods: The discovery of trofinetide for Rett syndrome (RTT) is described, and the role of nonmammalian, mammalian, and stem cell model systems in the identification of molecular targets and drug screening is discussed. We then provide a framework for translating preclinical findings to human clinical trials, including the role of biomarkers in selecting molecular targets and evaluating target engagement, and discuss how to leverage these findings for future ASD drug development. Results: Multiple preclinical model systems for ASD have been developed, each with tradeoffs with regard to suitability for high-throughput small molecule screening, conservation across species, and behavioral face validity. Future clinical trials should incorporate biomarkers and intermediate phenotypes to demonstrate target engagement. Factors that contributed to the approval of trofinetide for RTT included replicated findings in mouse models, a well-studied natural history of the syndrome, development of RTT-specific outcome measures, and strong engagement of the RTT family community. Conclusions: The translation of our growing understanding of the neurobiology of ASD to human drug discovery will require a precision medicine approach, including the use of multiple model systems for molecular target selection, evaluation of target engagement, and clinical trial design strategies that address heterogeneity, power, and the placebo response.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apneas.",

The increasing prevalence of GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity, and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) overcome many limitations of using peripheral blood derived macrophages. The ability to scale up and cryopreserve a large amount of end stage macrophages from single clonal iPSCs from normal and disease specific donors offers a unique opportunity for genomic analysis and drug screening. The present study describes the step wise generation and characterization of macrophages from iPSCs using a defined serum free method amenable to scale up to generate a large batch of pure end stage cryopreservable macrophages expressing CD68, CD33, CD11c, CD11b, CD1a, HLA-DR, CD86, CD64, CD80, CD206, CD169, CD47, HLA-ABC, and CX3CR. The end stage macrophages pre and post cryopreservation retain purity, morphology, responsiveness to stimuli and display robust phagocytic function coming right out of cryopreservation. The same differentiation process was used to generate end stage macrophages from isogenic iPSCs engineered to mimic mutations associated with Parkinson's disease (SNCA A53T), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (GRN2/GRN R493X), and Rett syndrome (MECP2-Knockout). End stage macrophages from isogenic engineered clones displayed differential macrophage-specific purity markers, phagocytic function, and response to specific stimuli. Thus, generating a panel of functional, physiologically relevant iPSC-derived macrophages can potentially facilitate the understanding of neural inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration.",

Here we engineered T. gondii's endogenous secretion systems, the rhoptries and dense granules, to deliver multiple large (>100 kDa) therapeutic proteins into neurons via translational fusions to toxofilin and GRA16. We demonstrate delivery in cultured cells, brain organoids and in vivo, and probe protein activity using imaging, pull-down assays, scRNA-seq and fluorescent reporters. We demonstrate robust delivery after intraperitoneal administration in mice and characterize 3D distribution throughout the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrate GRA16-mediated brain delivery of the MeCP2 protein, a putative therapeutic target for Rett syndrome. By characterizing the potential and current limitations of the system, we aim to guide future improvements that will be required for broader application.",

Due to the largely unknown pathophysiological mechanisms downstream the impairment of this transcriptional regulator, a specific treatment is not yet available. Since both haploinsufficiency and hyper-expression of FOXG1 cause diseases in humans, we reasoned that adding a gene under nonnative regulatory sequences would be a risky strategy as opposed to a genome editing approach where the mutated gene is reversed into wild-type. Here, we demonstrate that an adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)-coupled CRISPR/Cas9 system is able to target and correct FOXG1 variants in patient-derived fibroblasts, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons. Variant-specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and donor DNAs have been selected and cloned together with a mCherry/EGFP reporter system. Specific sgRNA recognition sequences were inserted upstream and downstream Cas9 CDS to allow self-cleavage and inactivation. We demonstrated that AAV serotypes vary in transduction efficiency depending on the target cell type, the best being AAV9 in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons, and AAV2 in iPSCs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mCherry+/EGFP+ transfected cells demonstrated that the mutated alleles were repaired with high efficiency (20-35% reversion) and precision both in terms of allelic discrimination and off-target activity. The genome editing strategy tested in this study has proven to precisely repair FOXG1 and delivery through an AAV9-based system represents a step forward toward the development of a therapy for Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Conventional methods of gene transfer lead to inconsistent transgene expression within cells. This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity. The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401 in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).",

Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

                    "abstract": "Despite the enormous efforts of the scientific community over the years, effective therapeutics for many (epi)genetic brain disorders remain unidentified. The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

CASE: A 13-year-old girl with a diagnosis of Rett syndrome, Stage IV, participated. The Individualized Numeric Rating Scale was developed in collaboration with the caregiver and scored by a physical therapist and student physical therapists during 16 sessions of whole body vibration training. OUTCOMES: The therapist and students reached 100% agreement on the Individualized Numeric Rating Scale ratings and successfully provided distractions to prevent pain and distress from reaching a level 5 out of 10 for 139 of 144 sessions. CONCLUSION: This is the first case in the literature to demonstrate use of the Individualized Numeric Rating Scale with a child who is nonverbal during a potentially painful physical therapy procedure.",

We examined two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS: We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1 years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION: ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.",

Previous work has demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that naturally travels from the human gut to the central nervous system (CNS), can deliver proteins to host cells. Here we engineered T. gondii's endogenous secretion systems, the rhoptries and dense granules, to deliver multiple large (>100 kDa) therapeutic proteins into neurons via translational fusions to toxofilin and GRA16. We demonstrate delivery in cultured cells, brain organoids and in vivo, and probe protein activity using imaging, pull-down assays, scRNA-seq and fluorescent reporters. We demonstrate robust delivery after intraperitoneal administration in mice and characterize 3D distribution throughout the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrate GRA16-mediated brain delivery of the MeCP2 protein, a putative therapeutic target for Rett syndrome. By characterizing the potential and current limitations of the system, we aim to guide future improvements that will be required for broader application.",

                    "abstract": "A considerable fraction of population in the world suffers from rare diseases. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival.

RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

It has become a major target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat memory impairment in both dementia patients and animal models of neurological diseases. Previously, we have reported the beneficial memory effects of chronic forniceal DBS in mouse models of intellectual disability disorders. In Rett syndrome and CDKL5 deficiency disorder models, DBS strengthens hippocampal synaptic plasticity, reduces dentate inhibitory transmission or increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis that aids memory. However, the underlying neuronal circuitry mechanisms remain unknown. This study we explored the neural network circuits involved in forniceal DBS treatment. Methods: We used acute forniceal DBS-induced expression of c-Fos, an activity-dependent neuronal marker, to map the brain structures functionally connected to the fornix. We also evaluated the mouse behavior of locomotion, anxiety, and fear memory after acute forniceal DBS treatment. Results: Acute forniceal DBS induces robust activation of multiple structures in the limbic system. DBS-induced neuronal activation extends beyond hippocampal formation and includes brain structures not directly innervated by the fornix. Conclusions: Acute forniceal DBS activates multiple limbic structures associated with emotion and memory. The neural circuits revealed here help elucidate the neural network effect and pave the way for further research on the mechanism by which forniceal DBS induces benefits on cognitive impairments.",

Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder which affects almost exclusively girls, caused by variants in MECP2 gene. Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2 gene transfer has been shown to extend the survival of Mecp2-/y knockout mice modelling Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

After gene transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

Despite promising results from strategies aimed at increasing MeCP2 levels, additional studies exploring how hypomorphic MeCP2 mutations impact the therapeutic window are needed. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically introducing a wild-type MECP2 transgene in the Mecp2 R133C mouse model of RTT. The MECP2 transgene reversed the majority of RTT-like phenotypes exhibited by male and female Mecp2 R133C mice. However, three core symptom domains were adversely affected in female Mecp2R133C/+ animals; these phenotypes resemble those observed in disease contexts of excess MeCP2. Parallel control experiments in Mecp2Null/+ mice linked these adverse effects to the hypomorphic R133C mutation. Collectively, these data provide evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of genetically overexpressing functional MeCP2 in Mecp2 R133C mice and suggest that personalized approaches may warrant consideration for the clinical assessment of MeCP2-targeted therapies.",

Due to the largely unknown pathophysiological mechanisms downstream the impairment of this transcriptional regulator, a specific treatment is not yet available. Since both haploinsufficiency and hyper-expression of FOXG1 cause diseases in humans, we reasoned that adding a gene under nonnative regulatory sequences would be a risky strategy as opposed to a genome editing approach where the mutated gene is reversed into wild-type. Here, we demonstrate that an adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)-coupled CRISPR/Cas9 system is able to target and correct FOXG1 variants in patient-derived fibroblasts, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons. Variant-specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and donor DNAs have been selected and cloned together with a mCherry/EGFP reporter system. Specific sgRNA recognition sequences were inserted upstream and downstream Cas9 CDS to allow self-cleavage and inactivation. We demonstrated that AAV serotypes vary in transduction efficiency depending on the target cell type, the best being AAV9 in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons, and AAV2 in iPSCs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mCherry+/EGFP+ transfected cells demonstrated that the mutated alleles were repaired with high efficiency (20-35% reversion) and precision both in terms of allelic discrimination and off-target activity. The genome editing strategy tested in this study has proven to precisely repair FOXG1 and delivery through an AAV9-based system represents a step forward toward the development of a therapy for Rett syndrome.",

However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.",

The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less.

We assessed the feasibility of a telehealth program supporting gross motor skills in RTT.Methods: Five girls with RTT were assessed and a home-based exercise program developed in response to functional goals. Families then participated in monthly Skype sessions for 6 months, guided by a physiotherapist to monitor progress and adjust the program as necessary. Goal Attainment Scaling was used to evaluate progress and a parental satisfaction questionnaire was administered.Results: Four goals were established for each participant and progress was greater than would be expected in 16 of 20 goals. Parents evaluated the program as feasible and useful for their daughters.Discussion: A telehealth model of home-based intervention supported individuals with RTT to achieve gross motor skills and was found to be feasible.

Gene therapy for this disease presents inherent hurdles since MECP2 is expressed throughout the brain and its duplication leads to severe neurological conditions as well. Herein, we use the AAV-PHP.eB to deliver an instability-prone Mecp2 (iMecp2) transgene cassette which, increasing RNA destabilization and inefficient protein translation of the viral Mecp2 transgene, limits supraphysiological Mecp2 protein levels. Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated delivery of iMecp2 provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

Despite promising results from strategies aimed at increasing MeCP2 levels, additional studies exploring how hypomorphic MeCP2 mutations impact the therapeutic window are needed. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically introducing a wild-type MECP2 transgene in the Mecp2 R133C mouse model of RTT. The MECP2 transgene reversed the majority of RTT-like phenotypes exhibited by male and female Mecp2 R133C mice. However, three core symptom domains were adversely affected in female Mecp2R133C/+ animals; these phenotypes resemble those observed in disease contexts of excess MeCP2. Parallel control experiments in Mecp2Null/+ mice linked these adverse effects to the hypomorphic R133C mutation. Collectively, these data provide evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of genetically overexpressing functional MeCP2 in Mecp2 R133C mice and suggest that personalized approaches may warrant consideration for the clinical assessment of MeCP2-targeted therapies.",

Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group.

Additionally, this new vector is highly efficacious at lower doses compared to previous constructs as demonstrated in extensive efficacy studies performed by two independent laboratories in two different Rett syndrome mouse models carrying either a knockout or one of the most frequent human mutations of MeCP2.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

Rett syndrome is the most common and is characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain; consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain. The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Previous work has demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that naturally travels from the human gut to the central nervous system (CNS), can deliver proteins to host cells. Here we engineered T. gondii's endogenous secretion systems, the rhoptries and dense granules, to deliver multiple large (>100 kDa) therapeutic proteins into neurons via translational fusions to toxofilin and GRA16. We demonstrate delivery in cultured cells, brain organoids and in vivo, and probe protein activity using imaging, pull-down assays, scRNA-seq and fluorescent reporters. We demonstrate robust delivery after intraperitoneal administration in mice and characterize 3D distribution throughout the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrate GRA16-mediated brain delivery of the MeCP2 protein, a putative therapeutic target for Rett syndrome. By characterizing the potential and current limitations of the system, we aim to guide future improvements that will be required for broader application.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2009, the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group published recommendations for children receiving ketogenic diet (KD) therapy for epilepsy. The document included a table listing epilepsy syndromes and conditions in which the KD has been particularly beneficial, hoping that physicians would refer children for the KD sooner. PURPOSE: To measure the impact of these 2009 recommendations on referral practice, we compared children initiated on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) 10 years before and after the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, children referred to the KD who met indications increased from the pre- to post-recommendation group, 44 % (112/256) to 69 % (175/255) (p < 0.001), with JHH neurologists specifically referring more frequently (10/112, 9 % to 58/175, 33 %) (p < 0.01). Referrals increased for Glut-1 deficiency (0 % to 2.4 %, p = 0.015), Dravet syndrome (0 % to 6.7 %, p < 0.01), Rett syndrome (0.4 % to 3 %, p = 0.018), and formula-fed only status (16 % to 31 %, p < 0.01). The chances of > 50 % seizure reduction for all children referred improved slightly between decades (56 % to 61 %, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Following the 2009 recommendations, our study shows there was an increase in referrals for children with indications at our center. Referrals from neurologists at our own institution increased the most. Ketogenic diet efficacy improved slightly over time but did not reach significance.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

This disorder mainly affects females, who typically have seemingly normal early development followed by a regression of acquired skills. The rodent Mecp2 model exhibits many of the classic neural abnormalities and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with Rett syndrome. Similar to individuals with Rett syndrome, both auditory discrimination ability and auditory cortical responses are impaired in heterozygous Mecp2 rats. The development of therapies that can enhance plasticity in auditory networks and improve auditory processing has the potential to impact the lives of individuals with Rett syndrome. Evidence suggests that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with sound presentation can drive robust neuroplasticity in auditory networks and enhance the benefits of auditory therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of VNS paired with tones to restore auditory processing in Mecp2 transgenic rats. METHODS: Seventeen female heterozygous Mecp2 rats and 8 female wild-type (WT) littermates were used in this study. The rats were exposed to multiple tone frequencies paired with VNS 300 times per day for 20 days. Auditory cortex responses were then examined following VNS-tone pairing therapy or no therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that Mecp2 mutation alters auditory cortex responses to sounds compared to WT controls. VNS-tone pairing in Mecp2 rats improves the cortical response strength to both tones and speech sounds compared to untreated Mecp2 rats. Additionally, VNS-tone pairing increased the information contained in the neural response that can be used to discriminate between different consonant sounds. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that VNS-sound pairing may represent a strategy to enhance auditory function in individuals with Rett syndrome.",

Similar to individuals with Rett syndrome, both auditory discrimination ability and auditory cortical responses are impaired in heterozygous Mecp2 rats. The development of therapies that can enhance plasticity in auditory networks and improve auditory processing has the potential to impact the lives of individuals with Rett syndrome. Evidence suggests that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with sound presentation can drive robust neuroplasticity in auditory networks and enhance the benefits of auditory therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of VNS paired with tones to restore auditory processing in Mecp2 transgenic rats. METHODS: Seventeen female heterozygous Mecp2 rats and 8 female wild-type (WT) littermates were used in this study. The rats were exposed to multiple tone frequencies paired with VNS 300 times per day for 20 days. Auditory cortex responses were then examined following VNS-tone pairing therapy or no therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that Mecp2 mutation alters auditory cortex responses to sounds compared to WT controls. VNS-tone pairing in Mecp2 rats improves the cortical response strength to both tones and speech sounds compared to untreated Mecp2 rats. Additionally, VNS-tone pairing increased the information contained in the neural response that can be used to discriminate between different consonant sounds. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that VNS-sound pairing may represent a strategy to enhance auditory function in individuals with Rett syndrome.",

Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both Cdkl5-/y and Cdkl5+/- mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. In vivo, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; ex vivo experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in Cdkl5-/y mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways, little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry. We find that CDKL5 loss reduces hippocampal synaptic plasticity and augments feedforward inhibition in the perforant path to the dentate gyrus in vivo in Cdkl5 mutant mice. Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice, as it had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Method: Two hundred and seventy-nine parents completed an online survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants were presented with five vignette scenarios involving adolescents with severe, treatment-resistant neurological or psychiatric conditions: Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Parents were then asked to evaluate each scenario and rate overall acceptability of using DBS to improve their child's core symptoms. Data were collected over a period of 2 weeks in the month of October 2018. Results: We found that parents reported favorable impressions of DBS regardless of the target condition, especially when greater improvement could be assured and when their child had the capacity to assist in the treatment decision-making. Parents indicated some reluctance to use DBS when possible safety concerns were present. Familiarity with DBS was directly associated with attitudes. Conclusions: The findings highlight an overall parental willingness to consider DBS as a treatment option for key symptoms of neurological and psychiatric conditions in adolescents.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

Gene therapy for this disease presents inherent hurdles since MECP2 is expressed throughout the brain and its duplication leads to severe neurological conditions as well. Herein, we use the AAV-PHP.eB to deliver an instability-prone Mecp2 (iMecp2) transgene cassette which, increasing RNA destabilization and inefficient protein translation of the viral Mecp2 transgene, limits supraphysiological Mecp2 protein levels. Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated delivery of iMecp2 provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.",

However, RTT is caused by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly, we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly, post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or, potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.",

These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated delivery of iMecp2 provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.",

Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused predominantly by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2, encoding transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease, these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective. While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations. We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However, careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls and women with RTT.",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

After gene transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse).

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms.

                    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X chromosome-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the transcription regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

Consequently, the use of innovative design and analysis of these clinical trials using model-informed approaches have become indispensable. This requires informative exposure-outcome analysis, together with formal statistical analysis, which should include the strength of evidence for a study outcome. We demonstrate how knowledge can be gained, with supporting strength of evidence, from a small (data) clinical trial with a low dose of blarcamesine in the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT). Based on a small data paradigm, pharmacometrics item response theory modeling and Bayes factor analysis were used to show that blarcamesine is efficacious in RTT.",

Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X chromosome-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the transcription regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied.

Moreover, caregivers of patients with RTT face stressors related to patients' medical and developmental concerns. Given the indications from case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. METHODS: Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music therapy program. RESULTS: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition, purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures. Lastly, caregivers in the study group exhibited significantly lower stress following the program. CONCLUSION: The 24-week music therapy program was effective in improving social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, hand function, and reducing seizure frequency among RTT patients. Additionally, music therapy was effective in relieving parenting stress, which may help healthcare providers initiate early intervention strategies that can prevent parenting stress and reduce the risk of depression.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) present characteristic regression in communication and hand skills, which eventually leads to intellectual and physical disability. Moreover, caregivers of patients with RTT face stressors related to patients' medical and developmental concerns. Given the indications from case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. METHODS: Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music therapy program. RESULTS: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition, purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures. Lastly, caregivers in the study group exhibited significantly lower stress following the program. CONCLUSION: The 24-week music therapy program was effective in improving social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, hand function, and reducing seizure frequency among RTT patients. Additionally, music therapy was effective in relieving parenting stress, which may help healthcare providers initiate early intervention strategies that can prevent parenting stress and reduce the risk of depression.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

Despite promising results from strategies aimed at increasing MeCP2 levels, additional studies exploring how hypomorphic MeCP2 mutations impact the therapeutic window are needed. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically introducing a wild-type MECP2 transgene in the Mecp2 R133C mouse model of RTT. The MECP2 transgene reversed the majority of RTT-like phenotypes exhibited by male and female Mecp2 R133C mice. However, three core symptom domains were adversely affected in female Mecp2R133C/+ animals; these phenotypes resemble those observed in disease contexts of excess MeCP2. Parallel control experiments in Mecp2Null/+ mice linked these adverse effects to the hypomorphic R133C mutation. Collectively, these data provide evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of genetically overexpressing functional MeCP2 in Mecp2 R133C mice and suggest that personalized approaches may warrant consideration for the clinical assessment of MeCP2-targeted therapies.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

The increasing prevalence of GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity, and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apneas.",

Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Patients with RS have severe motor abnormalities and are often unable to walk, use hands and speak. The preservation of perceptual and cognitive functions is hard to assess, while clinicians and care-givers point out that these patients need more time to process information than typically developing peers. Neurophysiological correlates of auditory processing have been also found to be distorted in RS, but sound presentation rates were relatively quick in these studies (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA < 1000 ms). As auditory event-related potential (ERP) is typically increased with prolongation of SOA we aim to study if SOA prolongation might compensate for observed abnormalities. METHODS: We presented a repetitive stimulus (1000 Hz) at three different SOAs of 900 ms, 1800 ms, and 3600 ms in children with RS (N = 24, Mean age = 9.0 +- 3.1) and their typical development (TD) peers (N = 27, Mean age = 9.7 +- 3.4) while recording 28-channels electroencephalogram, EEG. Some RS participants (n = 10) did not show clear ERP and were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Major ERP components (here assessed as N1P1 and P2N1 peak-to-peak values) were smaller at SOA 900 than at longer SOAs in both groups, pointing out that the basic mechanism of adaptation in the auditory system is preserved in at least in RS patients with evident ERPs. At the same time the latencies of these components were significantly delayed in the RS than in TD. Moreover, late components (P2N1 and N2P2) were drastically reduced in Rett syndrome irrespective of the SOA, suggesting a largely affected mechanism of integration of upcoming sensory input with memory. Moreover, developmental stagnation of auditory ERP characterized patients with RS: absence of typical P2N1 enlargement and P1 and N1 shortening with age at least for shortest SOA. LIMITATIONS: We could not figure out the cause for the high percentage of no-evident ERP RS participants and our final sample of the RS group was rather small. Also, our study did not include a control clinical group.

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations of the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene. Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity. The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401 in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).",

Consequently, the use of innovative design and analysis of these clinical trials using model-informed approaches have become indispensable. This requires informative exposure-outcome analysis, together with formal statistical analysis, which should include the strength of evidence for a study outcome. We demonstrate how knowledge can be gained, with supporting strength of evidence, from a small (data) clinical trial with a low dose of blarcamesine in the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT). Based on a small data paradigm, pharmacometrics item response theory modeling and Bayes factor analysis were used to show that blarcamesine is efficacious in RTT.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation.

                    "title": "Pre-op considerations in neuromuscular scoliosis deformity surgery: proceedings of the half day course at the 58th annual meeting of the Scoliosis Research Society.",
                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We highlight novel and emerging therapies in the treatment of childhood-onset movement disorders. We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.",

Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden.

In this review, we provide a blueprint for translational precision medicine in ASD and related neurogenetic syndromes. Methods: The discovery of trofinetide for Rett syndrome (RTT) is described, and the role of nonmammalian, mammalian, and stem cell model systems in the identification of molecular targets and drug screening is discussed. We then provide a framework for translating preclinical findings to human clinical trials, including the role of biomarkers in selecting molecular targets and evaluating target engagement, and discuss how to leverage these findings for future ASD drug development. Results: Multiple preclinical model systems for ASD have been developed, each with tradeoffs with regard to suitability for high-throughput small molecule screening, conservation across species, and behavioral face validity. Future clinical trials should incorporate biomarkers and intermediate phenotypes to demonstrate target engagement. Factors that contributed to the approval of trofinetide for RTT included replicated findings in mouse models, a well-studied natural history of the syndrome, development of RTT-specific outcome measures, and strong engagement of the RTT family community. Conclusions: The translation of our growing understanding of the neurobiology of ASD to human drug discovery will require a precision medicine approach, including the use of multiple model systems for molecular target selection, evaluation of target engagement, and clinical trial design strategies that address heterogeneity, power, and the placebo response.",

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly, or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems, it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments. Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat RTT patients.",

Families then participated in monthly Skype sessions for 6 months, guided by a physiotherapist to monitor progress and adjust the program as necessary. Goal Attainment Scaling was used to evaluate progress and a parental satisfaction questionnaire was administered.Results: Four goals were established for each participant and progress was greater than would be expected in 16 of 20 goals.

The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training.

We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

No cure exists for RTT. We previously reported that the behavioural phenotype and brain mitochondria dysfunction are widely rescued by a single intracerebroventricular injection of the bacterial toxin CNF1 in a RTT mouse model carrying a truncating mutation of the MeCP2 gene (MeCP2-308 mice). Given the heterogeneity of MECP2 mutations in RTT patients, we tested the CNF1 therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model carrying a null mutation (MeCP2-Bird mice). CNF1 selectively rescued cognitive defects, without improving other RTT-related behavioural alterations, and restored brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in MeCP2-Bird mice. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential CNF1 effects on the behavioural phenotype, we compared treatment effects on relevant signalling cascades in the brain of the two RTT models. CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308 hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential therapeutic approaches across RTT models.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2 deficiency causes a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders that can affect both genders. Rett syndrome is the most common and is characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain; consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain. The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden.

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile.

No cure exists for RTT. We previously reported that the behavioural phenotype and brain mitochondria dysfunction are widely rescued by a single intracerebroventricular injection of the bacterial toxin CNF1 in a RTT mouse model carrying a truncating mutation of the MeCP2 gene (MeCP2-308 mice). Given the heterogeneity of MECP2 mutations in RTT patients, we tested the CNF1 therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model carrying a null mutation (MeCP2-Bird mice). CNF1 selectively rescued cognitive defects, without improving other RTT-related behavioural alterations, and restored brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in MeCP2-Bird mice. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential CNF1 effects on the behavioural phenotype, we compared treatment effects on relevant signalling cascades in the brain of the two RTT models. CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308 hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential therapeutic approaches across RTT models.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene. Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs.

Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene. Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2 deficiency causes a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders that can affect both genders. Rett syndrome is the most common and is characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain; consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain. The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.",

                    "abstract": "A considerable fraction of population in the world suffers from rare diseases. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chloroquine (CQ) is an antimalarial drug with a growing number of applications as recently demonstrated in attempts to treat Covid-19. For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

Rett syndrome is the most common and is characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain; consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain. The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation.

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Conventional methods of gene transfer lead to inconsistent transgene expression within cells. This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity. The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401 in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly, or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems, it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments.

During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

                    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

We previously showed that forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains.

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported.

For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002).

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Conventional methods of gene transfer lead to inconsistent transgene expression within cells. This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity. The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401 in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).",

However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

                    "abstract": "Despite the enormous efforts of the scientific community over the years, effective therapeutics for many (epi)genetic brain disorders remain unidentified. The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

The vast majority of the human transcriptome corresponds to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) of different size, localization, and expression profile. Despite the fact that a biological function remains yet to be determined for most ncRNAs, growing evidence points to their crucial regulatory roles at all stages in gene expression regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional control, so that proper cell homeostasis seems to depend largely on a variety of ncRNA-mediated regulatory networks. This is particularly relevant in the human brain, which displays the richest repertoire of ncRNA species, and where several different ncRNA molecules are known to be involved in crucial steps for brain development and maturation. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by loss of function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MECP2 deficiency impacts globally on gene expression programs, mainly through its role as a transcriptional repressor, and growing data also points to an important dysregulation of the noncoding transcriptome in the disease. Here, we review the current knowledge on ncRNA alterations in Rett and explore links with other pathologies that might indicate the potential use of particular noncoding transcripts as therapeutical targets, tools, or disease biomarkers.",

Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lifespan has increased in individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT), but little is currently known about the provision of well-woman care to these individuals. OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), severely impairs learning and memory. We previously showed that forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

                    "abstract": "Nutritional supplements are traditionally employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.",

                    "title": "Neurophysiological Signatures of Motor Impairment in Patients with Rett Syndrome.",
                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",
