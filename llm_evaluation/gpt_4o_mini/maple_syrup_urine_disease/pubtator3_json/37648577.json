                    "text": "BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing liver transplantation for metabolic diseases, removing the patient's liver for transplantation to another recipient is called \"domino liver transplantation.\" The extracted liver can be divided and transplanted into 2 recipients, which is called domino split-liver transplantation in the literature. However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated. RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes. The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\"",
