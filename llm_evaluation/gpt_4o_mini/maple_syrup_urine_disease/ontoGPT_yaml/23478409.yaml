input_text: Biochemical correlates of neuropsychiatric illness in maple syrup urine
  disease. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder of branched chain
  amino acid metabolism presenting with neonatal encephalopathy, episodic metabolic
  decompensation, and chronic amino acid imbalances. Dietary management enables survival
  and reduces risk of acute crises. Liver transplantation has emerged as an effective
  way to eliminate acute decompensation risk. Psychiatric illness is a reported MSUD
  complication, but has not been well characterized and remains poorly understood.
  We report the prevalence and characteristics of neuropsychiatric problems among
  37 classical MSUD patients (ages 5-35 years, 26 on dietary therapy, 11 after liver
  transplantation) and explore their underlying mechanisms. Compared with 26 age-matched
  controls, MSUD patients were at higher risk for disorders of cognition, attention,
  and mood. Using quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found lower
  brain glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine concentrations in MSUD patients,
  which correlated with specific neuropsychiatric outcomes. Asymptomatic neonatal
  course and stringent longitudinal biochemical control proved fundamental to optimizing
  long-term mental health. Neuropsychiatric morbidity and neurochemistry were similar
  among transplanted and nontransplanted MSUD patients. In conclusion, amino acid
  dysregulation results in aberrant neural networks with neurochemical deficiencies
  that persist after transplant and correlate with neuropsychiatric morbidities. These
  findings may provide insight into general mechanisms of psychiatric illness.
