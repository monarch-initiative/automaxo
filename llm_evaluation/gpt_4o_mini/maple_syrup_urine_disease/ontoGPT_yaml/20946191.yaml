input_text: 'Cognitive and adaptive functioning after liver transplantation for maple
  syrup urine disease: a case series. MSUD is a complex metabolic disorder that has
  been associated with central nervous system damage, developmental delays, and neurocognitive
  deficits. Although liver transplantation provides a metabolic cure for MSUD, changes
  in cognitive and adaptive functioning following transplantation have not been investigated.
  In this report, we present data from 14 patients who completed cognitive and adaptive
  functioning testing pre- and one yr and/or three yr post-liver transplantation.
  Findings show either no significant change (n=8) or improvement (n=5) in IQ scores
  pre- to post-liver transplantation. Greater variability was observed in adaptive
  functioning scores, but the majority of patients evidenced no significant change
  (n=8) in adaptive scores. In general, findings indicate that liver transplantation
  minimizes the likelihood of additional central nervous system damage, providing
  an opportunity for possible stabilization or improvement in neurocognitive functioning.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
