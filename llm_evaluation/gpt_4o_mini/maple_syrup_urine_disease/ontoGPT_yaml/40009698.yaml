input_text: BCKDHA-BCKDHB digenic gene therapy restores metabolic homeostasis in two
  mouse models and a calf with classic maple syrup urine disease. Classic maple syrup
  urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain
  alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide
  branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial
  BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and
  valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening
  neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an
  exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement
  therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus
  serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB)
  to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of
  BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells
  and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type
  mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models
  of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for
  BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth,
  restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver,
  heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion.
  In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement
  strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and
  liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms
  of MSUD in humans.
