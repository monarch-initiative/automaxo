input_text: 'Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency (maple syrup urine
  disease): Treatment, biomarkers, and outcomes. Over the past three decades, we studied
  184 individuals with 174 different molecular variants of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid
  dehydrogenase activity, and here delineate essential clinical and biochemical aspects
  of the maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) phenotype. We collected data about treatment,
  survival, hospitalization, metabolic control, and liver transplantation from patients
  with classic (i.e., severe; n = 176), intermediate (n = 6) and intermittent (n =
  2) forms of MSUD. A total of 13,589 amino acid profiles were used to analyze leucine
  tolerance, amino acid homeostasis, estimated cerebral amino acid uptake, quantitative
  responses to anabolic therapy, and metabolic control after liver transplantation.
  Standard instruments were used to measure neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite advances
  in clinical care, classic MSUD remains a morbid and potentially fatal disorder.
  Stringent dietary therapy maintains metabolic variables within acceptable limits
  but is challenging to implement, fails to restore appropriate concentration relationships
  among circulating amino acids, and does not fully prevent cognitive and psychiatric
  disabilities. Liver transplantation eliminates the need for a prescription diet
  and safeguards patients from life-threatening metabolic crises, but is associated
  with predictable morbidities and does not reverse pre-existing neurological sequelae.
  There is a critical unmet need for safe and effective disease-modifying therapies
  for MSUD which can be implemented early in life. The biochemistry and physiology
  of MSUD and its response to liver transplantation afford key insights into the design
  of new therapies based on gene replacement or editing.'
