input_text: Continuous venovenous hemofiltration rapidly lowers toxic metabolites
  in a patient with MSUD and imminent cerebral herniation. Maple syrup urine disease
  (MSUD) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism. During catabolic stress encephalopathy
  and brain swelling that can culminate in brain herniation may occur. Beyond the
  neonatal period, these metabolic decompensations normally can be treated with a
  conservative dietary emergency regimen. Nevertheless in exceptionally severe cases
  also older patients may require extracorporeal interventions. We present the case
  of a 12-year-old patient with cerebral edema and imminent cerebral herniation. Continuous
  venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) caused a prompt decrease of the toxic metabolite
  levels as well as an improvement of the patient's condition.
