input_text: Evaluation of dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis as a novel indicator
  of oxidative stress in maple syrup urine disease patients under treatment. Maple
  syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a metabolic disorder that is caused by deficiency
  of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Although accumulation of
  toxic metabolites is associated with neurotoxicity, mechanisms underlying brain
  damage remain unclear. Aim of this study is to evaluate thiol/disulphide homeostasis
  as a novel indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients under treatment. Twenty
  patients with MSUD and 20 healthy individuals were included in study. All patients
  were under regular follow-up and had a good metabolic control. Serum native thiol
  (-SH), total thiol (-SH + -S-S-), disulphide (-S-S) levels were measured in all
  subjects. Disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total
  thiol ratios were calculated from these values. Simultaneous blood sampling for
  plasma quantitative amino acid analysis was performed in both groups. Any significant
  difference was not observed in -SH, -SH + -S-S-, -S-S levels between two groups.
  In addition no increase of disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios
  was detected in patient group. This study is the first study that evaluates dynamic
  thiol/disulphide homeostasis as an indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients.
  Among previous studies that were made to determine oxidative stress in treated MSUD
  patients, this study had the largest sample size also. In recent studies, it was
  claimed that oxidative stress could be responsible from neurotoxicity even in treated
  patients. Here, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis status showed that providing
  good metabolic control in MSUD patients prevent oxidative stress. Under regular
  follow-up and good compliance with diet, additional antioxidant therapies would
  possibly not be necessary.
