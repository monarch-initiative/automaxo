input_text: "Efficacy and safety of intermittent hemodialysis in infants and young
  children with inborn errors of metabolism. BACKGROUND: Intermittent hemodialysis
  (IHD) is the most efficient form of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for removing
  toxic substances from patients' bodies. However, the efficacy and safety of IHD
  in infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism are still not clear.
  METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with urea cycle disorders, maple
  syrup urine disease, and methylmalonic acidemia who received IHD or non-IHD RRT
  at our hospital between 2001 and 2012 to remove ammonia, leucine, or methylmalonic
  acid. Both the efficacy and safety of the RRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five
  courses of RRT, including 25 courses of IHD and ten courses of non-IHD RRT, for
  15 patients were included in the analysis. Before 2006, non-IHD RRT procedures,
  including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH),
  were the most often used; from 2006 onwards IHD was used. There was one procedure-unrelated
  death. Catheter penetration occurred in one course of IHD. The efficacy data revealed
  that both the median duration of dialysis and the median 50 % toxin reduction time
  were shorter in IHD than in non-IHD RRT. CONCLUSIONS: In infants and young children
  with inborn errors of metabolism, IHD is safe and more efficient than non-IHD RRT
  at removing toxins."
