input_text: In Vivo Intracerebral Administration of alpha-Ketoisocaproic Acid to Neonate
  Rats Disrupts Brain Redox Homeostasis and Promotes Neuronal Death, Glial Reactivity,
  and Myelination Injury. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by severe deficiency
  of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity, resulting in tissue
  accumulation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids and amino acids, particularly alpha-ketoisocaproic
  acid (KIC) and leucine. Affected patients regularly manifest with acute episodes
  of encephalopathy including seizures, coma, and potentially fatal brain edema during
  the newborn period. The present work investigated the ex vivo effects of a single
  intracerebroventricular injection of KIC to neonate rats on redox homeostasis and
  neurochemical markers of neuronal viability (neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN)), astrogliosis
  (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), and myelination (myelin basic protein
  (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)) in the cerebral
  cortex and striatum. KIC significantly disturbed redox homeostasis in these brain
  structures 6 h after injection, as observed by increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein
  oxidation (reactive oxygen species generation), malondialdehyde levels (lipid oxidative
  damage), and carbonyl formation (protein oxidative damage), besides impairing the
  antioxidant defenses (diminished levels of reduced glutathione and altered glutathione
  peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities) in both
  cerebral structures. Noteworthy, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and melatonin
  attenuated or normalized most of the KIC-induced effects on redox homeostasis. Furthermore,
  a reduction of NeuN, MBP, and CNPase, and an increase of GFAP levels were observed
  at postnatal day 15, suggesting neuronal loss, myelination injury, and astrocyte
  reactivity, respectively. Our data indicate that disruption of redox homeostasis,
  associated with neural damage caused by acute intracerebral accumulation of KIC
  in the neonatal period may contribute to the neuropathology characteristic of MSUD
  patients.
