input_text: "Classical maple syrup urine disease and brain development: principles
  of management and formula design. Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency
  results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development.
  Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying
  physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a
  20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize
  transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete
  with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter
  (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine
  caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential
  fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was
  enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and
  alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started
  on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in
  the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses.
  All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand,
  leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal
  growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline,
  most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated
  rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased
  plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes
  into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and
  serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and
  docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period,
  hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28
  hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated
  by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority
  of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula
  and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and
  effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment
  protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion,
  neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology
  of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace
  the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete
  amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake
  to the metabolic demands of growth and illness."
