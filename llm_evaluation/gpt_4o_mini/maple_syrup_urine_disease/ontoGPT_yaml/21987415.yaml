input_text: 'Domino liver transplantation: how far can we push the paradigm? Domino
  liver transplantation (DLT) has emerged as a strategy for increasing the number
  of liver grafts available: morphologically normal livers from donors with metabolic
  diseases can be used for select recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (usually
  outside the Milan criteria). Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is the most
  common indication for DLT. When FAP patients are involved in DLT, the indications
  and outcomes are clear and good, although de novo FAP development within various
  periods of time has been described in DLT recipients of FAP livers. With the increasing
  need for organs, livers explanted from patients with rare metabolic diseases, such
  as primary hyperoxaluria (PH), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD), and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFHC), are being used
  for DLT. However, insufficient data about the use of livers from patients with these
  rare metabolic diseases are available. In this review, we focus on the latter disorders.
  PH is not a good indication for DLT because recipients of PH livers develop hyperoxaluria
  and early acute renal failure. AIP also seems to be a debatable indication for DLT
  because of the rapid development of neurotoxicity in AIP liver recipients. However,
  the outcomes of DLT with HFHC and MSUD liver grafts (which include the risk of the
  de novo development of these genetic diseases) are promising. For rare metabolic
  liver diseases to be established as indications for DLT, more reports and studies
  are needed.'
