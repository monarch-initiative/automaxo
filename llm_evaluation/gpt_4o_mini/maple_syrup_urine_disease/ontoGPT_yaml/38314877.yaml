input_text: 'Changes in branched-chain amino acids in an infant with maple syrup urine
  disease during perioperative pediatric liver transplant: A case report. An 11-month-old
  female infant diagnosed with classic subtype IB maple syrup urine disease underwent
  living donor liver transplantation. Blood samples for plasma amino acid analysis
  were collected during the three phases of the operation. Despite the perioperative
  prophylactic administration of 12.5% hypertonic dextrose solution with insulin and
  a 20% intralipid emulsion, the blood levels of the branched-chain amino acids increased
  dramatically during surgery, consistent with an acute intraoperative metabolic decompensation.
  However, these blood levels normalized soon after liver transplantation with an
  excellent outcome. We suggest that the occurrence of an intraoperative metabolic
  crisis during liver transplantation is not necessarily a sign of graft failure.'
