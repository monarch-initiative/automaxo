input_text: 'Acute Administration of Branched-Chain Amino Acids Increases the Pro-BDNF/Total-BDNF
  Ratio in the Rat Brain. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by an inborn
  error in metabolism resulting from a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto
  acid dehydrogenase complex activity. This blockage leads to accumulation of the
  branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine and valine, as well as their
  corresponding alpha-keto acids and alpha-hydroxy acids. High levels of BCAAs are
  associated with neurological dysfunction and the role of pro- and mature brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neurological dysfunction of MSUD is still unclear.
  Thus, in the present study we investigated the effect of an acute BCAA pool administration
  on BDNF levels and on the pro-BDNF cleavage-related proteins S100A10 and tissue
  plasminogen activator (tPA) in rat brains. Our results demonstrated that acute Hyper-BCAA
  (H-BCAA) exposure during the early postnatal period increases pro-BDNF and total-BDNF
  levels in the hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, tPA levels were significantly
  decreased, without modifications in the tPA transcript levels in the hippocampus
  and striatum. On the other hand, the S100A10 mRNA and S100A10 protein levels were
  not changed in the hippocampus and striatum. In the 30-day-old rats, we observed
  increased pro-BDNF, total-BDNF and tPA levels only in the striatum, whereas the
  tPA and S100A10 mRNA expression and the immunocontent of S100A10 were not altered.
  In conclusion, we demonstrated that acute H-BCAA administration increases the pro-BDNF/total-BDNF
  ratio and decreases the tPA levels in animals, suggesting that the BCAA effect may
  depend, at least in part, on changes in BDNF post-translational processing. '
