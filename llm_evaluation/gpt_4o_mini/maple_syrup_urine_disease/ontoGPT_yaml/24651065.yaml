input_text: 'Branched-chain amino acid metabolism: from rare Mendelian diseases to
  more common disorders. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism plays a central
  role in the pathophysiology of both rare inborn errors of metabolism and the more
  common multifactorial diseases. Although deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid
  dehydrogenase (BCKDC) and associated elevations in the BCAAs and their ketoacids
  have been recognized as the cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) for decades,
  treatment options for this disorder have been limited to dietary interventions.
  In recent years, the discovery of improved leucine tolerance after liver transplantation
  has resulted in a new therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Likewise, targeting
  the regulation of the BCKDC activity may be an alternative potential treatment strategy
  for MSUD. The regulation of the BCKDC by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase
  kinase has also been implicated in a new inborn error of metabolism characterized
  by autism, intellectual disability and seizures. Finally, there is a growing body
  of literature implicating BCAA metabolism in more common disorders such as the metabolic
  syndrome, cancer and hepatic disease. This review surveys the knowledge acquired
  on the topic over the past 50 years and focuses on recent developments in the field
  of BCAA metabolism. '
