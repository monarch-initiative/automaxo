input_text: 'Maple syrup urine disease: Clinical outcomes, metabolic control, and
  genotypes in a screened population after four decades of newborn bloodspot screening
  in the Republic of Ireland. Since 1972, 18 patients (10 females/8 males) have been
  detected by newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) with neonatal-onset maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD) in Ireland. Patients were stratified into three clusters according
  to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical,
  and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient
  died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with
  clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147 975. Overall
  good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially
  normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single
  SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed
  genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state
  for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation
  of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting
  of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine >=400 mumol/L (outside therapeutic
  range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due
  to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management
  during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key
  risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through
  diet with early implementation of a "sick day" regime and, in some cases, dialysis
  as a rescue therapy. The Irish cohort, despite largely classical phenotypes, achieved
  good outcomes in the NBS era, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and
  skilled multidisciplinary team management.'
