input_text: "Placental stem cell correction of murine intermediate maple syrup urine
  disease. UNLABELLED: There is improved survival and partial metabolic correction
  of a mouse intermediate maple syrup urine disease (iMSUD) model after allogenic
  hepatocyte transplantation, confirming that a small number of enzyme-proficient
  liver-engrafted cells can improve phenotype. However, clinical shortages of suitable
  livers for hepatocyte isolation indicate a need for alternative cell sources. Human
  amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) share stem cell characteristics without the latter's
  safety and ethical concerns and differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells. Eight direct
  hepatic hAEC transplantations were performed in iMSUD mice over the first 35 days
  beginning at birth; animals were provided a normal protein diet and sacrificed at
  35 and 100 days. Treatment at the neonatal stage is clinically relevant for MSUD
  and may offer a donor cell engraftment advantage. Survival was significantly extended
  and body weight was normalized in iMSUD mice receiving hAEC transplantations compared
  with untreated iMSUD mice, which were severely cachectic and died <=28 days after
  birth. Branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme activity was significantly
  increased in transplanted livers. The branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine,
  valine, and alloisoleucine were significantly improved in serum and brain, as were
  other large neutral amino acids. CONCLUSION: Placental-derived stem cell transplantation
  lengthened survival and corrected many amino acid imbalances in a mouse model of
  iMSUD. This highlights the potential for their use as a viable alternative clinical
  therapy for MSUD and other liver-based metabolic diseases."
