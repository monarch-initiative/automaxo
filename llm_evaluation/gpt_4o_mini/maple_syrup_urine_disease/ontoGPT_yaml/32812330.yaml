input_text: Genotype-phenotype correlation of 33 patients with maple syrup urine disease.
  Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder
  due to defects in the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC).
  MSUD varies in severity and its clinical spectrum is quite broad, ranging from mild
  to severe phenotypes. Thirty-three MSUD patients were recruited into this study
  for molecular genetic variant profiling and genotype-phenotype correlation. Except
  for one patient, all other patients presented with the classic neonatal form of
  the disease. Seventeen different variants were detected where nine were novel. The
  detected variants spanned across the entire BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes. All variants
  were in homozygous forms. The commonest alterations were nonsense and frameshift
  variants, followed by missense variants. For the prediction of variant's pathogenicity,
  we used molecular modeling and several in silico tools including SIFT, Polyphen2,
  Condel, and Provean. In addition, six other tools were used for the prediction of
  the conservation of the variants' sites including Eigen-PC, GERP++, SiPhy, PhastCons
  vertebrates and primates, and PhyloP100 rank scores. Herein, we presented a comprehensive
  characterization of a large cohort of patients with MSUD. The clinical severity
  of the variants' phenotypes was well correlated with the genotypes. The study underscores
  the importance of the use of in silico analysis of MSUD genotypes for the prediction
  of the clinical outcomes in patients with MSUD.
