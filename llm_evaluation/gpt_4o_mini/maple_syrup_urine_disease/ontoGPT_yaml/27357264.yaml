input_text: "Heterozygous liver transplantation for maple syrup urine disease: First
  European reported case. MSUD is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that results
  from a defect in the BCKDH enzyme. This enzyme is essential for the second step
  in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
  Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless
  closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine
  throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer
  from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased
  donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids,
  even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of
  illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a
  child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial
  as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and
  have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant
  provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often
  requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited
  medical resources. "
