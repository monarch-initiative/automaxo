input_text: "Domino Liver Transplant in Maple Syrup Urine Disease: Technical Details
  of Cases in Which the First Surgery Involved a Living Donor. BACKGROUND: Data describing
  the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in
  maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes
  only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular
  stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here,
  we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical
  aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with
  MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were
  used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received
  a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the
  confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal
  vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery
  in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was
  performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and
  in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty.
  No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3
  cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed
  in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor
  liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands
  technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction."
