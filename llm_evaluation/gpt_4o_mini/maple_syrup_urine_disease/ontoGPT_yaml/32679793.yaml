input_text: Effects of Cryogenic Storage on Human Amnion Epithelial Cells. Perinatal
  stem cells and epithelial cells isolated from full term amnion membrane, in particular,
  have attracted interest over the last decade, as a promising source of multipotent
  cells for cellular therapies. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) have been used
  to treat monogenetic liver disease such as maple syrup urine disease or fibrosis
  of the liver in preclinical studies. In most studies xeno-transplants of hAEC were
  conducted without providing immunosuppression to recipients, reflecting the tolerogenic
  properties of hAEC. For many cell types, successful cryopreservation is critical
  for providing a readily available, off-the-shelf product. In this study, hAEC were
  isolated from full-term human placenta from 14 different donors, cryopreserved using
  a protocol and reagents commonly adopted for epithelial cell preservation. The cells
  were analyzed in terms of survival, recovery, and homogeneity, profiled for surface
  markers characteristic of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, or hematopoietic
  cells. There were no significant differences observed in the percentage of cells
  with epithelial cell markers before and after cryopreservation. The relative proportion
  of stromal and hematopoietic cells was significantly reduced in hAEC preparations
  after cryopreservation. The expression of stem cell and immunomodulatory molecules
  were confirmed in the final product. Since multipotent cells are readily available
  from full-term placenta, this novel cell source might significantly increase the
  number of patients eligible to receive cellular therapies for liver and other diseases.
