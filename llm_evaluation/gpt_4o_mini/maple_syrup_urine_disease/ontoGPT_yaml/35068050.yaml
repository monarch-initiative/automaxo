input_text: "Inborn error of metabolism patients after liver transplantation: Outcomes
  of 35 patients over 27 years in one pediatric quaternary hospital. Liver transplantation
  (LT) has been used for many years as a therapeutic option for certain inborn errors
  of metabolism (IEMs). Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with
  LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone
  LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic
  decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea
  cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the
  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions
  have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine
  disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic
  acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation
  was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic
  stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted.
  Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained
  metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does
  not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems.
  Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most
  patients no longer follow with a geneticist."
