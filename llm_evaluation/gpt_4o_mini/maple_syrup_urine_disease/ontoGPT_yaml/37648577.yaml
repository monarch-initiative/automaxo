input_text: "Living Donor-Initiated Domino Split-Liver Transplantation in Pediatric
  Setup: A Case Report With Literature Review. BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing
  liver transplantation for metabolic diseases, removing the patient's liver for transplantation
  to another recipient is called \"domino liver transplantation.\" The extracted liver
  can be divided and transplanted into 2 recipients, which is called domino split-liver
  transplantation in the literature. However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained
  from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
  underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in
  situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic
  data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated.
  RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old
  boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes.
  The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right
  lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient
  were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who
  underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative
  day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation
  died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION:
  Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor
  choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient
  volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\""
