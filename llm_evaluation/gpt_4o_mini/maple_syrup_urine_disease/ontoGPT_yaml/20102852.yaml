input_text: 'Perspectives on dietary adherence among women with inborn errors of metabolism.
  Adherence to highly restrictive diets is critical for women of childbearing age
  who have inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria. The purpose of this
  study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary
  adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence
  among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level
  interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups
  including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria,
  methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer
  camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts.
  Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and
  some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many
  reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced
  in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining
  dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular
  who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods
  was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning
  from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies
  for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for
  women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some,
  educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered
  dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care
  providers.'
