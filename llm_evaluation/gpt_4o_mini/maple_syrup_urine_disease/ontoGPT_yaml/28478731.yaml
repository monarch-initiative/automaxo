input_text: 'Maple syrup urine disease: tailoring a plan for pregnancy. Maple syrup
  urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal metabolic condition that can cause significant
  morbidity in pregnant women and their infants. Advances in nutritional management
  mean more mothers with congenital metabolic disorders are becoming pregnant, and
  presenting challenges in obstetric care. In particular, the increase in protein
  requirements during pregnancy and metabolic stress of childbirth require careful
  planning and caloric titration. We report a case of a second time mother with MSUD
  and demonstrate a treatment scaffold to help achieve successful pregnancies for
  women with this and similar conditions.'
