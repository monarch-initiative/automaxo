input_text: The Impact of Diet on Body Composition in a Cohort of Pediatric and Adult
  Patients with Maple Syrup Urine Disease. The treatment for Maple Syrup Urine Disease
  (MSUD) consists of a hypoproteic diet with integration therapy to limit leucine
  intake, ensuring adequate energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients to prevent
  catabolism and promote anabolism. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study
  at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza,
  Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation,
  and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the
  dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect
  of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight,
  BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected.
  Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which
  5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet
  and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass.
  A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation
  between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free
  mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive
  effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition
  of patients with MSUD. A similar study involving all Italian metabolic centers treating
  MSUD is recommended.
