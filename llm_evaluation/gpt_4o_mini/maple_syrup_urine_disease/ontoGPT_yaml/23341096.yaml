input_text: 'Diagnostic tools of early brain disturbances in an asymptomatic neonate
  with maple syrup urine disease. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare inherited
  metabolic disorder resulting from the defective activity of branched-chain 2-ketoacid
  dehydrogenase complex. Routine screening of newborn with tandem mass spectroscopy
  on the third day of life may detect elevated branched-chain amino acids in blood
  before the appearance of encephalopathic symptoms in MSUD cases. If undiagnosed
  by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and
  seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography
  and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography,
  electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging
  spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed
  with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at
  the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already
  asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure
  can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance
  of early diagnosis and management. Patients may also benefit from these investigations
  during the follow-up period. '
