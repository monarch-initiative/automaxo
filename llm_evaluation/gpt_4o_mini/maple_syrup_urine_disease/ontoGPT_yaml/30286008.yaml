input_text: "Red Blood Cell Transfusion in Pediatric Orthotopic Liver Transplantation:
  What a Difference a Few Decades Make. BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation in children
  is often associated with coagulopathy and significant blood loss. Available data
  are limited. In this observational retrospective study, we assessed transfusion
  practices in pediatric patients undergoing liver transplantation at a single institution
  over the course of 9 years. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from patient
  medical records at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh
  Medical Center. All patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 2008
  to June 2017 were included. Primary and secondary outcomes were volume of red blood
  cells (RBCs) transfused and mortality, respectively. RESULTS: From January 2008
  to June 2017, there were 278 liver transplants in 271 patients. The number of primary
  transplants were 259, second retransplants 15, and third retransplants 4. Average
  age at transplantation was 6.9 years. Biliary atresia, maple syrup urine disease,
  urea cycle defect, and liver tumor were the leading indications accounting for 66
  (23.7%), 45 (16.2%), 24 (8.6%), and 23 (8.3%) of transplants, respectively. Seventy-six
  cases (27.3%) did not require RBC transfusions. Among those transfused, 181 (89.6%)
  of the cases required <1 blood volume (BV). The median BV transfused among all cases
  was 0.21 (range, 0-9; Q1, 0; Q3, 0.45). There is a trend toward higher volume transfusions
  among infants (median, 0.46 BV) compared to children >12 months of age (0.12 BV).
  By diagnosis, the group requiring the highest median volume transfusion was patients
  with total parenteral nutrition-related liver failure (3.41 BV) followed by patients
  undergoing repeat transplants (0.6 BV). Comparison of primary versus repeat transplants
  shows a trend toward higher volume transfusions in third transplants (median, 2.71
  BV), compared to second transplants (0.43 BV) and primary transplants (0.18 BV).
  Four of 271 patients (1.5%) died during admission involving liver transplantation.
  Nine of 271 patients (3.3%) died subsequently. Total mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS:
  In contrast to historically reported trends, evaluation of current transfusion practices
  reveals that most patients undergoing liver transplantation receive <1 BV of packed
  RBCs. More than 1 in 4 transplantations require no transfusion at all. Risk factors
  for greater transfusion need include younger age, total parenteral nutrition-related
  liver failure, and repeat transplantation."
