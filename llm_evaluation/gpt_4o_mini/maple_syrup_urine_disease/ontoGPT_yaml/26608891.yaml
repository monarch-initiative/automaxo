input_text: Administration of branched-chain amino acids alters the balance between
  pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Acute leucine intoxication and
  neurologic deterioration can develop rapidly at any age as a result of net protein
  degradation precipitated by infection or psychological stress in patients with maple
  syrup urine disease (MSUD). Here, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic
  Hyper-BCAA (H-BCAA) administration on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the
  brains of rats. For acute administration, Wistar rats (10 and 30 days) received
  three injections of BCAA pool (15.8 muL/g at 1-h intervals) or saline, subcutaneously.
  For chronic administration, Wistar rats (7 days) received of BCAA pool or saline
  twice a day for 21 days, subcutaneously. Our results showed that acute administration
  of H-BCAA increased IL-1beta (~ 78%; p <= 0.009) and TNF-alpha (~ 155%; p <= 0.026)
  levels in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus of infant rats. Moreover,
  IL-6 levels were increased in the hippocampus (~ 135%; p <= 0.009) and cerebral
  cortex (~ 417%; p <= 0.008), whereas IL-10 levels were decreased only in the hippocampus
  (~ 42%; p <= 0.009). However, repeated administration of H-BCAA decreased IL-1beta
  (~ 59%; p <= 0.047), IL-6 (~ 70%; p <= 0.009) and IFN-gamma (~ 70%; p <= 0.008)
  levels in the cerebral cortex, whereas the IL-6 (~ 67%; p <= 0.009), IL-10 (~ 58%;
  p <= 0.01) and IFN-gamma (~ 67%; p <= 0.009) levels were decreased in the hippocampus.
  These findings suggest that a better understanding of the inflammatory response
  in MSUD patients may be useful to develop therapeutic strategies to modulate the
  hyperinflammatory/hypoinflammatory axis.
