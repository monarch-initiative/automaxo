input_text: 'Maple syrup urine disease in Brazil: a panorama of the last two decades.
  OBJECTIVE: To characterize a sample of Brazilian patients with maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD) diagnosed between 1992 and 2011. METHODS: In this retrospective study,
  patients were identified through a national reference laboratory for the diagnosis
  of MSUD and through contact with other medical genetics services across Brazil.
  Data were collected by means of a chart review. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients from
  75 families were enrolled in the study (median age, 3 years; interquartile range
  [IQR], 0.57-7). Median age at onset of symptoms was 10 days (IQR 5-30), whereas
  median age at diagnosis was 60 days (IQR 29-240, p=0.001). Only three (3.6%) patients
  were diagnosed before the onset of clinical manifestations. A comparison between
  patients with (n=12) and without (n=71) an early diagnosis shows that early diagnosis
  is associated with the presence of positive family history and decreased prevalence
  of clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, but not with a better outcome.
  Overall, 98.8% of patients have some psychomotor or neurodevelopmental delay. CONCLUSION:
  In Brazil, patients with MSUD are usually diagnosed late and exhibit neurological
  involvement and poor survival even with early diagnosis. We suggest that specific
  public policies for diagnosis and treatment of MSUD should be developed and implemented
  in the country.'
