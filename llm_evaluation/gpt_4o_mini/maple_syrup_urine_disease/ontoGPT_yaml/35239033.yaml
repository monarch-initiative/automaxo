input_text: 'Acute hemodialysis therapy in neonates with inborn errors of metabolism.
  BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), including organic acidemias and urea
  cycle defects, are characterized by systemic accumulation of toxic metabolites with
  deleterious effect on the developing brain. While hemodialysis (HD) is most efficient
  in clearing IEM-induced metabolic toxins, data regarding its use during the neonatal
  period is scarce. METHODS: We retrospectively summarize our experience with HD in
  20 neonates with IEM-induced metabolic intoxication (seven with maple syrup urine
  disease, 13 with primary hyperammonia), over a 16-year period, between 2004 and
  2020. All patients presented with IEM-induced neurologic deterioration at 48 h to
  14 days post-delivery, and were managed with HD in a pediatric intensive care setting.
  HD was performed through an internal jugular acute double-lumen catheter (6.5-7.0
  French), using an AK-200S (Gambro, Sweden) dialysis machine and tubing, with F3
  or FXpaed (Fresenius, Germany) dialyzers. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range)
  age and weight at presentation were 5 (3-8) days and 2830 (2725-3115) g, respectively.
  Two consecutive HD sessions decreased the mean leucine levels from 2281 +- 631 to
  179 +- 91 mumol/L (92.1% reduction) in MSUD patients, and the mean ammonia levels
  from 955 +- 444 to 129 +- 55 mumol/L (86.5% reduction), in patients with hyperammonemia.
  HD was uneventful in all patients, and led to marked clinical improvement in 17
  patients (85%). Three patients (15%) died during the neonatal period, and four died
  during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that
  HD is safe, effective, and life-saving for most neonates with severe IEM-induced
  metabolic intoxication, when promptly performed by an experienced and multidisciplinary
  team. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary
  information.'
