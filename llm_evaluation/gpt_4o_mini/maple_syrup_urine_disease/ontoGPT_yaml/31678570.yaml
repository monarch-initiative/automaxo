input_text: 'The utility of dried blood spot monitoring of branched-chain amino acids
  for maple syrup urine disease: A retrospective chart review study. BACKGROUND: Branched-chain
  amino acid (BCAA) concentrations must be tracked and maintained within an optimal
  range to minimize disease phenotypes in patients with maple syrup urine disease
  (MSUD). In 2014, the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) implemented a dried blood
  spot (DBS) home monitoring system, allowing patients to track BCAA concentrations
  without the inconvenience of having to travel to the hospital. METHODS: We conducted
  a retrospective chart review study (n = 15) to assess the impacts of DBS monitoring
  implementation on biochemical control. Furthermore, we explored relationships among
  various MSUD patient parameters, including monitoring frequency, age, biochemical
  control, and hospitalizations. RESULTS: There was a 35% increase in the proportion
  of LEU concentrations that met recommended targets post-DBS monitoring implementation.
  Monitoring frequency was positively associated with better biochemical control in
  the newborn period (r = 0.68, p = 0.046). Frequency of hospital visits decreased
  steadily throughout life. CONCLUSION: DBS monitoring has resulted in a sharp increase
  in monitoring frequency, which is further correlated with biochemical control. Younger
  patients are more likely to visit the hospital and respond better to increased monitoring
  efforts. We recommend that DBS monitoring be adopted by other centers more broadly
  to improve metabolic control in MSUD patients.'
