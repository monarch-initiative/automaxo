input_text: Ethical Analysis and Policy Recommendations Regarding Domino Liver Transplantation.
  Due to the widening gap between supply and demand, patients who need a liver transplant
  due to metabolic disease may be asked to serve as domino liver donors-to have their
  native liver transplanted into another candidate. We here analyze the ethical problems
  surrounding informed consent for the implant and explant procedures in transplant
  candidates who will serve as domino donors, using the case of a child with maple
  syrup urine disease. We discuss the need for 2 distinct consent processes separated
  in time to ensure that potential domino donors (or their surrogates) give a truly
  voluntary consent. We propose a Domino Donor Advocate-based on the concept of the
  independent living donor advocate to help the patient and/or his or her surrogates
  consider the risks, benefits and alternatives. Finally, we evaluate the Organ Procurement
  and Transplantation Network policy regarding "therapeutic organ donation" and propose
  several modifications to ensure that the decision by the potential domino donor
  (and/or his or her surrogate) is voluntary and informed.
