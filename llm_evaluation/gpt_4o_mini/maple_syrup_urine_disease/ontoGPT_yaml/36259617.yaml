input_text: Intestinal Mucormycosis in a Child With Maple Syrup Urine Disease After
  Orthotopic Liver Transplant. Mucormycosis can result in serious morbidity and mortality,
  especially in transplant recipients. In this case report, we present a 3-year-old
  female patient with maple syrup urine disease who developed mucormycosis infection
  after deceased donor split liver transplant. Progressive segmental necrosis of the
  small intestines and new ischemic areas were observed after repeated abdominal surgeries.
  Microscopic examination of biopsy material revealed mucormycosis. Early recognition
  is crucial for treatment, and patients with clinical suspicion can be treated empirically
  with antifungal medicine. However, diagnostic tests with accurate and fast results
  are needed and more effective therapeutic methods should be developed for better
  outcomes.
