input_text: Lipid nanoparticle mRNA therapy improves survival and reduces serum branched-chain
  amino acids in mouse models of maple syrup urine disease. Maple syrup urine disease
  (MSUD) is a rare, inherited, metabolic disorder characterized by dysfunction of
  the multi-subunit, mitochondrial enzyme complex branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase
  (BCKDH). BCKDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids
  (BCAAs). BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the
  blood and tissues in the absence of functional BCKDH. We evaluated a lipid nanoparticle
  (LNP)-based treatment approach to address all possible genetic mutations that can
  cause MSUD (BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT). In the intermediate MSUD mouse model, which
  harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT)
  subunit of BCKDH, repeated administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNA therapy significantly
  extended survival and reduced serum leucine levels. We also evaluated our LNP approach
  in several models of classic MSUD, namely DBT knockout (KO) mice and the new BCKDHA
  KO and BCKDHB KO mice. The latter two were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
  and contain the highly prevalent classic MSUD-causing mutations seen in the Mennonite
  and Costa Rican populations. Intravenous LNP-encapsulated mRNA administration extended
  survival and increased body weight in the DBT KO and BCKDHA KO models of classic
  MSUD but was not effective in BCKDHB KO mice. Our data provide a promising proof-of-concept
  that a universal, mutation-independent approach to treating MSUD is possible and
  viable.
