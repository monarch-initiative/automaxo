input_text: 'Liver and/or kidney transplantation in amino and organic acid-related
  inborn errors of metabolism: An overview on European data. BACKGROUND: This study
  provides a general overview on liver and/or kidney transplantation in patients with
  an amino and organic acid-related disorder (AOA) with the aim to investigate patient
  characteristics and global outcome in Europe. This study was an initiative of the
  E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all
  clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism
  (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic
  acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle
  disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation
  in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney
  transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients),
  followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant
  survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall,
  the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological
  complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications
  occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually
  absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all,
  except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority
  (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION:
  The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems
  satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved
  cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are
  indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.'
