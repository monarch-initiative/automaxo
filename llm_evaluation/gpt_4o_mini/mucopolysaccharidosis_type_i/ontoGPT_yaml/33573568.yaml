input_text: 'Gene Therapy of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Mice: Repeated Administrations
  and Safety Assessment of pIDUA/Nanoemulsion Complexes. BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is an inherited disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency.
  The available treatments are not effective in improving all signs and symptoms of
  the disease. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the transfection efficiency
  of repeated intravenous administrations of cationic nanoemulsions associated with
  the plasmid pIDUA (containing IDUA gene). METHODS: Cationic nanoemulsions were composed
  of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(amino[polyethylene
  glycol]- 2000) (DSPE-PEG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP),
  medium- chain triglycerides, glycerol, and water and were prepared by high-pressure
  homogenization and were repeatedly administered to MPS I mice for IDUA production
  and gene expression. RESULTS: A significant increase in IDUA expression was observed
  in all organs analyzed, and IDUA activity tended to increase with repeated administrations
  when compared to our previous report when mice received a single administration
  of the same dose. In addition, GAGs were partially cleared from organs, as assessed
  through biochemical and histological analyzes. There was no presence of inflammatory
  infiltrate, necrosis, or signs of an increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry
  for CD68 showed a reduced presence of macrophage cells in treated than in untreated
  MPS I mice. CONCLUSION: These sets of results suggest that repeated administrations
  can improve transfection efficiency of cationic complexes without a significant
  increase in toxicity in the MPS I murine model.'
