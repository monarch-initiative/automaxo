input_text: Neonatal combination therapy improves some of the clinical manifestations
  in the Mucopolysaccharidosis type I murine model. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I),
  a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme,
  results in the progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and consequent multiorgan
  dysfunction. Despite the effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in correcting clinical manifestations
  related to visceral organs, complete improvement of musculoskeletal and neurocognitive
  defects remains an unmet challenge and provides an impact on patients' quality of
  life. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining HSCT and ERT in the neonatal
  period. Using a mouse model of MPS-I, we demonstrated that the combination therapy
  improved clinical manifestations in organs usually refractory to current treatment.
  Moreover, combination with HSCT prevented the production of anti-IDUA antibodies
  that negatively impact ERT efficacy. The added benefits of combining both treatments
  also resulted in a reduction of skeletal anomalies and a trend towards decreased
  neuroinflammation and metabolic abnormalities. As currently there are limited therapeutic
  options for MPS-I patients, our findings suggest that the combination of HSCT and
  ERT during the neonatal period may provide a further step forward in the treatment
  of this rare disease.
