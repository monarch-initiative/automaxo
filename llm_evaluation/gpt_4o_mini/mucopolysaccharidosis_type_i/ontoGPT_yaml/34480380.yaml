input_text: 'MPS I: Early diagnosis, bone disease and treatment, where are we now?
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized
  by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency. Patients present with a broad spectrum of disease
  severity ranging from the most severe phenotype (Hurler) with devastating neurocognitive
  decline, bone disease and early death to intermediate (Hurler-Scheie) and more attenuated
  (Scheie) phenotypes, with a normal life expectancy. The most severely affected patients
  are preferably treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which halts
  the neurocognitive decline. Patients with more attenuated phenotypes are treated
  with enzyme replacement therapy. There are several challenges to be met in the treatment
  of MPS I patients. First, to optimize outcome, early recognition of the disease
  and clinical phenotype is needed to guide decisions on therapeutic strategies. Second,
  there is thus far no effective treatment available for MPS I bone disease. The pathophysiological
  mechanisms behind bone disease are largely unknown, limiting the development of
  effective therapeutic strategies. This article is a state of the art that comprehensively
  discusses three of the most urgent open issues in MPS I: early diagnosis of MPS
  I patients, pathophysiology of MPS I bone disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies
  for MPS I bone disease.'
