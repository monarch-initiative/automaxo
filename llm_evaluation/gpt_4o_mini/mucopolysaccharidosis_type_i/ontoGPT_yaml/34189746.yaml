input_text: Mucopolysaccharidoses type I gene therapy. Mucopolysaccharidoses type
  I (MPS I) is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by a malfunction of the
  alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme leading to the storage of glycosaminoglycans in
  the lysosomes. This disease has longtime been studied as a therapeutic target for
  those studying gene therapy and many studies have been done using various vectors
  to deliver the IDUA gene for corrective treatment. Many vectors have difficulties
  with efficacy and insertional mutagenesis concerns including adeno-associated viral
  (AAV) vectors. Studies of AAV vectors treating MPS I have seemed promising, but
  recent deaths in gene therapy clinical trials for other inherited diseases using
  AAV vectors have left questions about their safety. Additionally, the recent modifications
  to adenoviral vectors leading them to target the vascular endothelium minimizing
  the risk of hepatotoxicity could lead to them being a viable option for MPS I gene
  therapy when coupled with gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9.
