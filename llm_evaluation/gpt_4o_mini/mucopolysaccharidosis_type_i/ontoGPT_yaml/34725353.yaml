input_text: Self-inactivating, all-in-one AAV vectors for precision Cas9 genome editing
  via homology-directed repair in vivo. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important
  delivery platforms for therapeutic genome editing but are severely constrained by
  cargo limits. Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy
  and increase safety risks. Here, we describe single-vector, ~4.8-kb AAV platforms
  that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs for segmental deletions, or a single
  sgRNA with a homology-directed repair (HDR) template. We also use anti-CRISPR proteins
  to enable production of vectors that self-inactivate via Nme2Cas9 cleavage. We further
  introduce a nanopore-based sequencing platform that is designed to profile rAAV
  genomes and serves as a quality control measure for vector homogeneity. We demonstrate
  that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary
  tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice by HDR-based
  correction of the disease allele. These results will enable the engineering of single-vector
  AAVs that can achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.
