input_text: 'Obstructive sleep apnea and craniofacial appearance in MPS type I-Hurler
  children after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe
  multi-systemic organ manifestations including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice in severe
  MPS I (MPS IH, Hurler syndrome). However, the effect of HSCT on OSAS in MPS IH still
  remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze respiratory patterns during
  sleep following HSCT in MPS IH children and to relate these findings to craniofacial
  abnormalities. METHODS: Overnight polysomnographies of nine MPS IH children (mean
  age: 8.2 years) previously treated with HSCT were retrospectively analyzed. Magnetic
  resonance images of the head were assessed with regard to soft and hard tissue abnormalities
  of the upper respiratory tract. RESULTS: The mean apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was
  5.3 events/h (range, 0.3-12.2), and the majority of apnea/hypopneas were obstructive.
  Whereas two patients had severe OSAS (AHI > 10) and two moderate OSAS (5 > AHI <
  10), five patients had no evidence of OSAS (AHI < 2.0). Donor cell chimerism was
  significantly lower in MPS IH patients with OSAS as compared to patients without
  OSAS (p < 0.001). The upper airway space and the maxilla were significantly smaller
  and the adenoids larger in MPS IH patients with OSAS as compared to those of non-OSAS
  patients. CONCLUSION: OSAS was only observed in MPS IH patients with graft failure
  or low donor cell chimerism. Conversely, successful HSCT seems to ameliorate adenoid
  hyperplasia and maxillary constriction in MPS IH patients and thereby minimizes
  the risk of OSAS at least at younger ages.'
