input_text: "Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (Aldurazyme ) for treating
  mucopolysaccharidosis type I. BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified
  as three clinical sub-types; Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Scheie
  syndrome, with the scale of severity being such that Hurler syndrome is the most
  severe and Scheie syndrome the least severe. It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
  caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme results
  in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations
  are facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity
  and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence.
  There are more attenuated variants termed Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with
  those affected potentially not presenting until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy
  has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although
  the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those
  diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane
  Review published in 2013 and previously updated in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
  the effectiveness and safety of treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase
  enzyme replacement therapy as compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
  Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism
  Trials Register, MEDLINE via OVID and Embase.Date of most recent search: 30 January
  2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of
  laronidase enzyme replacement therapy compared to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  Two authors independently screened the identified studies. The authors then appraised
  and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS:
  One study (45 participants) met the inclusion criteria. This double-blind, placebo-controlled,
  randomised, multinational study looked at laronidase at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg/week
  versus placebo in people with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. All primary outcomes
  listed in this review were studied in this study. The laronidase group achieved
  statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced vital capacity
  compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96) (low-quality
  evidence) and in the six-minute-walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the
  laronidase group; P = 0.039, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance)
  (low-quality evidence). The levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly
  reduced (low-quality evidence). In addition, there were improvements in hepatomegaly,
  sleep apnoea and hypopnoea. Laronidase antibodies were detected in nearly all participants
  in the treatment group with no apparent clinical effect and titres were reducing
  by the end of the study (very low-quality evidence). Infusion-related adverse reactions
  occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated medical intervention
  or infusion cessation (low-quality evidence). As assessed by questionnaires,changes
  in a 'Disability Index' after treatment were small and did not differ between groups
  (low-quality evidence). There were no deaths in either group (low-quality evidence).
  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrates that laronidase is effective
  when compared to placebo in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included
  study was comprehensive, with few participants and of low quality. The study included
  all of the key outcome measures we wished to look at. It demonstrated that laronidase
  is efficacious in relation to reducing biochemical parameters (reduced urine glycosaminoglycan
  excretion) and improved functional capacity as assessed by forced vital capacity
  and the six-minute-walk test. In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced
  as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume. Laronidase appeared to be safe and,
  while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study.
  More studies are required to determine long-term effectiveness and safety and to
  assess the impact upon quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase
  can be used pre- and peri-haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold
  standard treatment in those individuals diagnosed under 2.5 years of age. We do
  not anticipate any further trials to be undertaken and therefore do not plan to
  update this review."
