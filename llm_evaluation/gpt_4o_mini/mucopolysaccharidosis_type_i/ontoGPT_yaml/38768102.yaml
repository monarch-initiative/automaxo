input_text: Discovery of allosteric regulators with clinical potential to stabilize
  alpha-L-iduronidase in mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal disease caused by lowered activity of the enzyme
  alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Current therapeutic options show limited efficacy and
  do not treat some important aspects of the disease. Therefore, it may be advantageous
  to identify strategies that could improve the efficacy of existing treatments. Pharmacological
  chaperones are small molecules that protect proteins from degradation, and their
  use in combination with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been proposed as an
  alternative therapeutic strategy. Using the SEE-Tx  proprietary computational drug
  discovery platform, a new allosteric ligand binding cavity in IDUA was identified
  distal from the active site. Virtual high-throughput screening of approximately
  5 million compounds using the SEE-Tx  docking platform identified a subset of small
  molecules that bound to the druggable cavity and functioned as novel allosteric
  chaperones of IDUA. Experimental validation by differential scanning fluorimetry
  showed an overall hit rate of 11.4%. Biophysical studies showed that one exemplary
  hit molecule GT-01803 bound to (Kd = 22 muM) and stabilized recombinant human IDUA
  (rhIDUA) in a dose-dependent manner. Co-administration of rhIDUA and GT-01803 increased
  IDUA activity in patient-derived fibroblasts. Preliminary in vivo studies have shown
  that GT-01803 improved the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rhIDUA, increasing plasma
  levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GT-01803 also increased IDUA enzymatic
  activity in bone marrow tissue, which benefits least from standard ERT. Oral bioavailability
  of GT-01803 was found to be good (50%). Overall, the discovery and validation of
  a novel allosteric chaperone for rhIDUA presents a promising strategy to enhance
  the efficacy of existing treatments for MPS I. The compound's ability to increase
  rhIDUA activity in patient-derived fibroblasts and its good oral bioavailability
  underscore its potential as a potent adjunct to ERT, particularly for addressing
  aspects of the disease less responsive to standard treatment.
