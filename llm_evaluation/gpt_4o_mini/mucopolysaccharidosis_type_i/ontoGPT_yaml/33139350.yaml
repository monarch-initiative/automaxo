input_text: 'Improvement in time to treatment, but not time to diagnosis, in patients
  with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis and treatment initiation
  are important factors for successful treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I). The purpose of this observational study was to assess whether age at diagnosis
  and time to first treatment for individuals with MPS I have improved over the last
  15 years. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the MPS I Registry (NCT00144794) for individuals
  with attenuated or severe disease who initiated therapy with laronidase enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 1 January
  2003 and 31 December 2017 were included. RESULTS: Data were available for 740 individuals
  with attenuated (n=291) or severe (n=424) MPS I (unknown n=25). Median age at diagnosis
  for attenuated disease did not change over time and ranged between 4.5 and 6 years
  of age while the median duration from diagnosis to first ERT decreased from 5.6
  years before/during 2004 to 2.4 months in 2014-2017. For severe MPS I treated with
  HSCT, median age at diagnosis was less than 1 year and median time to first treatment
  was less than 3 months throughout the 15-year observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Times
  to diagnosis and HSCT initiation for individuals with severe MPS I were consistent
  over time. For individuals with attenuated MPS I, the time to ERT initiation after
  diagnosis has improved substantially in the last 15 years, but median age at diagnosis
  has not improved. Efforts to improve early diagnosis in attenuated MPS I are needed
  to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment at the optimal time.'
