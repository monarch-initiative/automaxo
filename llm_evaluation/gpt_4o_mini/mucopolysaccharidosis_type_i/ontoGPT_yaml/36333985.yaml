input_text: '18-year follow-up of enzyme-replacement therapy in two siblings with
  attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal
  recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase and characterized
  by a progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, MPS I is divided
  into two forms: (1) severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized
  by rapid progressive neurological involvement; (2) attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and
  Scheie syndromes), which displays a slower progression and absent to mild nervous
  system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated MPS I consists of enzyme-replacement
  therapy with laronidase (human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We
  present updated data after 18 years of laronidase treatment in two siblings affected
  by the attenuated form of MPS I who started therapy at 5 months and 5 years of age,
  respectively. Clinical and laboratory data of the siblings show that long-term enzyme
  replacement therapy may improve/stabilize many symptoms already present at the time
  of the diagnosis and reduce the disease progression. This study confirms that early
  diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy are essential to modify
  positively the natural history of the attenuated form of MPS I.'
