input_text: Safe and Sustained Expression of Human Iduronidase After Intrathecal Administration
  of Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 9 in Infant Rhesus Monkeys. Many neuropathic
  diseases cause early, irreversible neurologic deterioration, which warrants therapeutic
  intervention during the first months of life. In the case of mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I, a recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency of
  the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), one of the most promising treatment
  approaches is to restore enzyme expression through gene therapy. Specifically, administering
  pantropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding IDUA into the cerebrospinal fluid
  (CSF) via suboccipital administration has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in large
  animals. Preclinical safety studies conducted in adult nonhuman primates supported
  a positive risk-benefit profile of the procedure while highlighting potential subclinical
  toxicity to primary sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This
  study investigated the long-term performance of intrathecal cervical AAV serotype
  9 gene transfer of human IDUA administered to 1-month-old rhesus monkeys (N = 4)
  with half of the animals tolerized to the human transgene at birth via systemic
  administration of an AAV serotype 8 vector expressing human IDUA from the liver.
  Sustained expression of the transgene for almost 4 years is reported in all animals.
  Transduced cells were primarily pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus,
  Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lower motor neurons, and DRG neurons. Both tolerized
  and non-tolerized animals were robust and maintained transgene expression as measured
  by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue. However, the presence of antibodies
  in the non-tolerized animals led to a loss of measurable levels of secreted enzyme
  in the CSF. These results support the safety and efficiency of treating neonatal
  rhesus monkeys with AAV serotype 9 gene therapy delivered into the CSF.
