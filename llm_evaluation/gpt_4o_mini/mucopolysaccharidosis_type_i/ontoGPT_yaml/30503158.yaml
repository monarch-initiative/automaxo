input_text: 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe MPS I in the first six
  months of life: The heart of the matter. BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplantation
  (HCT) is accepted therapy for severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS IH). With
  implementation of newborn screening (NBS) for MPS I in the US, HCT may now occur
  earlier than 1-2 years of age and it might be assumed that cardiac issues will be
  fewer. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our records for any MPS IH infant
  who underwent HCT at <=6 months of age. STUDY PATIENTS: Pre- and (most recent) post-HCT
  cardiac echos and clinical courses were reviewed in all infants with MPS IH undergoing
  HCT at <=6 months of age. RESULTS: 7 MPS IH infants (4 M) who were diagnosed at
  median (range) (MEDRNG) of 14 (3, 22) days of life (DOL) by NBS [2] or because an
  older sib had MPS IH [5], began enzyme replacement therapy at MEDRNG of 48 (7, 62)
  DOL. First pre-HCT echo was performed at MEDRNG of 45 (0, 88) DOL. HCT (6 cord blood,
  1 related) occurred at MEDRNG of 131 (105, 183) DOL with most recent echo at MEDRNG
  of 408 (10, 1897) days after HCT. Mitral regurgitation (>=mild) occurred before
  (2/7) and after (2/7) HCT; LVH (2/7) occurred after HCT; PFO was common before (5/7)
  and after (3/7) HCT. One infant had severely decreased function at initial echo
  and required ICU management. Another infant with a patent foramen ovale and indwelling
  central line required additional neuroimaging to determine the cause of a seizure.
  A final infant died unexpectedly 69 days post-HCT without evidence of occlusive
  coronary disease at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the traditional phenotypic
  features of severe MPS I, newborns presenting for HCT have cardiac and non-cardiac
  problems unique to their young age. Recognition of these issues is essential for
  optimal outcomes.'
