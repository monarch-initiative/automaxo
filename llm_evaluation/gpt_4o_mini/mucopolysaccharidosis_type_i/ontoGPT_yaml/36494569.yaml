input_text: 'Long term follow-up after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for
  mucopolysaccharidosis type I-H: a retrospective study of 51 patients. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I-H (MPS I-H) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-Iduronidase
  deficiency. Early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the sole available
  therapeutic option to preserve neurocognitive functions. We report long-term follow-up
  (median 9 years, interquartile range 8-16.5) for 51 MPS I-H patients who underwent
  HSCT between 1986 and 2018 in France. 4 patients died from complications of HSCT
  and one from disease progression. Complete chimerism and normal alpha-L-Iduronidase
  activity were obtained in 84% and 71% of patients respectively. No difference of
  outcomes was observed between bone marrow and cord blood stem cell sources. All
  patients acquired independent walking and 91% and 78% acquired intelligible language
  or reading and writing. Intelligence Quotient evaluation (n = 23) showed that 69%
  had IQ >= 70 at last follow-up. 58% of patients had normal or remedial schooling
  and 62% of the 13 adults had good socio-professional insertion. Skeletal dysplasia
  as well as vision and hearing impairments progressed despite HSCT, with significant
  disability. These results provide a long-term assessment of HSCT efficacy in MPS
  I-H and could be useful in the evaluation of novel promising treatments such as
  gene therapy.'
