input_text: Intra-articular nonviral gene therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis I mice.
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by the lysosomal accumulation of
  glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase
  (IDUA). Currently available treatments may improve several clinical manifestations,
  but they have limited effects on joint disease, resulting in persistent orthopedic
  complications and impaired mobility. Thus, this study aimed to perform an intra-articular
  administration of cationic nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid encoding for
  the IDUA protein (pIDUA) targeting MPS I gene therapy for the synovial joints. Formulations
  composed of DOPE, DOTAP, MCT (NE), and DSPE-PEG (NE-PEG) were prepared by high-pressure
  homogenization, and the pIDUA plasmid was associated by adsorption onto the surface
  of nanoemulsions (pIDUA/NE or pIDUA/NE-PEG). The physicochemical characterization
  showed that the presence of DSPE-PEG in pIDUA/NE-PEG formulations led to small and
  highly stable droplets even when incubated with simulated synovial fluid (SSF),
  when compared to the non-pegylated complexes (pIDUA/NE). Uptake by fibroblast-like
  synoviocytes (FLS) was demonstrated, and high cell viability (70%) in addition with
  increased IDUA activity (2.5% of normal) were observed after incubation with pIDUA/NE-PEG.
  The intra-articular injection of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes in MPS I mice showed that
  the complexes were localized in the joints, were able to transfect synovial cells,
  and thus promoted an increase in IDUA activity and expression in the synovial fluid,
  with no significant activity in other tissues (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen).
  The overall results demonstrated a contained, safe, tolerable, and effective in
  situ approach of nonviral intra-articular gene therapy targeting the reduction or
  prevention of the debilitating orthopedic complications of MPS I disorder.
