input_text: 'Intranasal Adeno-Associated Virus Mediated Gene Delivery and Expression
  of Human Iduronidase in the Central Nervous System: A Noninvasive and Effective
  Approach for Prevention of Neurologic Disease in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is a progressive, multi-systemic, inherited metabolic disease caused
  by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Current treatments for this disease
  are ineffective in treating central nervous system (CNS) disease due to the inability
  of lysosomal enzymes to traverse the blood-brain barrier. A noninvasive and effective
  approach was taken in the treatment of CNS disease by intranasal administration
  of an IDUA-encoding adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector. Adult IDUA-deficient
  mice aged 3 months were instilled intranasally with AAV9-IDUA vector. Animals sacrificed
  5 months post instillation exhibited IDUA enzyme activity levels that were up to
  50-fold that of wild-type mice in the olfactory bulb, with wild-type levels of enzyme
  restored in all other parts of the brain. Intranasal treatment with AAV9-IDUA also
  resulted in the reduction of tissue glycosaminoglycan storage materials in the brain.
  There was strong IDUA immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections observed in
  the nasal epithelium and olfactory bulb, but there was no evidence of the presence
  of transduced cells in other portions of the brain. This indicates that reduction
  of storage materials most likely occurred as a result of enzyme diffusion from the
  olfactory bulb and the nasal epithelium into deeper areas of the brain. At 8 months
  of age, neurocognitive testing using the Barnes maze to assess spatial navigation
  demonstrated that treated IDUA-deficient mice were no different from normal control
  animals, while untreated IDUA-deficient mice exhibited significant learning and
  navigation deficits. This novel, noninvasive strategy for intranasal AAV9-IDUA instillation
  could potentially be used to treat CNS manifestations of human MPS I.'
