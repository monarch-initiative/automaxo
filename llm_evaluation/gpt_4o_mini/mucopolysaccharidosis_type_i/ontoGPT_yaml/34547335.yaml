input_text: Evidence of Treatment Benefits in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I-Hurler in Long-term Follow-up Using a New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring
  System. We developed a brain and spine magnetic resonance scoring system based on
  a magnetic resonance assessment of 9 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler
  who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The score is reliable and
  correlates with long-term clinical and cognitive outcome in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I-Hurler.
