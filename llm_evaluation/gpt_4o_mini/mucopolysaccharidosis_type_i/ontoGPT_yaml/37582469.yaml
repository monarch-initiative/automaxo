input_text: Incidence of bloodstream infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  for Hurler Syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic disorder
  characterized by the deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme necessary for
  the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the lysosome. Hurler syndrome is
  the most severe form of MPS I, manifesting as multiorgan dysfunction, cognitive
  delay, and death, usually within ten years if left untreated. Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant (HSCT) is the optimal treatment option since it provides a permanent
  solution to enzyme deficiency and halts cognitive decline. However, transplant-associated
  thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) are HSCT
  complications that are also known risk factors for bloodstream infections (BSI).
  BSIs are a serious complication of HSCT, contributing to poor outcomes and transplant-related
  morbidity. There are little data evaluating BSI after HSCT in the Hurler patient
  population. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with Hurler syndrome
  who underwent HSCT at our center between 2013 and 2020 to determine the incidence
  of BSI within the first-year post-transplant. Twenty-five patients were included
  in the analysis; the majority (n=17, 68%) were male, with a median age of 1.1 years
  (IQR 0.35 to 1.44) at the time of transplant. The most common graft source was cord
  blood (n=15, 54%), followed by bone marrow (n=13, 46%), with the majority from matched
  unrelated donors (n=14, 52%) and mismatched unrelated donors (n=13, 44%). Sixteen
  BSIs were diagnosed in 12 patients (n=12, 48%). Most infections (n=7, 43.8%) were
  diagnosed in the first 20 days after transplant, with fewer infections being observed
  at later time points. The incidence rate of BSIs in Hurlers patients (n=12, 48%)
  was higher than the reported general pediatric HSCT population one-year post-transplant
  (15-35%). Given the high rate of Hurlers patients diagnosed with both TA-TMA and
  a BSI (n=7, 78%), we suspect a possible correlation between the two. Additionally,
  due to the time it takes for GAG levels to normalize post-HSCT in Hurlers patients,
  it is reasonable to suspect that the high BSI rates in these patients are linked
  to their Hurlers diagnosis.
