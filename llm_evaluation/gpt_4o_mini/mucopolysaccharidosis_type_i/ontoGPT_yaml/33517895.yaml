input_text: 'Long term disease burden post-transplantation: three decades of observations
  in 25 Hurler patients successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT). BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPSI-H) is a lysosomal
  storage disease characterized by severe physical symptoms and cognitive decline.
  Early treatment with hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) is critical to the survival
  of these patients. While survival rates and short-term outcomes are known to be
  improved by HSCT, the long-term cognitive, adaptive and psychosocial functional
  outcomes of children with (MPSI-H) post-HSCT are not well documented. This manuscript
  focuses on retrospective long-term follow-up (7-33 years) of 25 MPSI-H patients,
  transplanted between 1986 and 2011. RESULTS: The median age at transplantation was
  21 months (range 12-57 months). Except for one death, all successfully transplanted
  MPSI-H patients surviving at least 1 year after HSCT are alive to-date, with a median
  age of 21 years (range 8-36 years) at the last follow-up evaluation. A majority
  of HSCT grafts were bone marrow transplants (BMT), resulting in durable full chimerism
  in 18 (72%). Pre-HSCT, the onset of first symptoms occurred very early, at a median
  age of 3 months (range birth-16 months). The most prevalent symptoms before MPSI-H
  diagnosis involved progressive dysostosis multiplex; almost all patients suffered
  from hip dysplasia and thoracolumbar spine Kyphosis. Despite HSCT, considerable
  residual disease burden and ensuing corrective surgical interventions were observed
  in all, and at every decade of follow-up post HSCT. Late-onset psychiatric manifestations
  were significant (n = 17 patients; 68%), including depression in 13 patients at
  a median onset age of 18 years (range 13-31 years), hyperactivity and attention
  deficit disorder (n = 4), and multiple acute psychotic episodes (APE), independent
  of depression observed (n = 3) at a median onset age of 18 years (range 17-31 years).
  The adult Welscher Intelligence Scale results (n = 16) were heterogenous across
  the four scale dimensions; overall lower scores were observed on both working memory
  index (median WMI = 69.5) and processing speed index (median PSI = 65), whereas
  verbal comprehension index (median VCI = 79) and perceptual reasoning index (median
  PRI = 74) were higher. CONCLUSION: With advanced treatment options, MPSI-H are living
  into 3rd and 4th decades of life, however not disease free and with poor adaptation.
  Residual disease (loss of mobility, limited gross and fine motor skills; low cognitive
  ability; suboptimal cardiopulmonary function, vision and hearing) negatively impacts
  the quality of life and psychosocial functioning of affected individuals.'
