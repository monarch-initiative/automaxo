input_text: Neonatal nonviral gene editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system improves some
  cardiovascular, respiratory, and bone disease features of the mucopolysaccharidosis
  I phenotype in mice. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by deficiency
  of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), leading to multisystemic accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
  (GAG). Untreated MPS I patients may die in the first decades of life, mostly due
  to cardiovascular and respiratory complications. We previously reported that the
  treatment of newborn MPS I mice with intravenous administration of lipossomal CRISPR/Cas9
  complexes carrying the murine Idua gene aiming at the ROSA26 locus resulted in long-lasting
  IDUA activity and GAG reduction in various tissues. Following this, the present
  study reports the effects of gene editing in cardiovascular, respiratory, bone,
  and neurologic functions in MPS I mice. Bone morphology, specifically the width
  of zygomatic and femoral bones, showed partial improvement. Although heart valves
  were still thickened, cardiac mass and aortic elastin breaks were reduced, with
  normalization of aortic diameter. Pulmonary resistance was normalized, suggesting
  improvement in respiratory function. In contrast, behavioral abnormalities and neuroinflammation
  still persisted, suggesting deterioration of the neurological functions. The set
  of results shows that gene editing performed in newborn animals improved some manifestations
  of the MPS I disorder in bone, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. However,
  further studies will be imperative to find better delivery strategies to reach "hard-to-treat"
  tissues to ensure better systemic and neurological effects.
