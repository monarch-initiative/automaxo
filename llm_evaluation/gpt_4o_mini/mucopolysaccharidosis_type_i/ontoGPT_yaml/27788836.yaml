input_text: 'Outcomes of Long-Term Treatment with Laronidase in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes of laronidase enzyme replacement
  therapy in patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I. STUDY DESIGN:
  Retrospective analyses of case notes, laboratory results, and data from clinical
  trials were used to evaluate urinary glycosaminoglycans, forced vital capacity (FVC),
  6-minute walk test (6MWT), height-for-age Z score, cardiac valve function, corneal
  clouding, and visual acuity in 35 patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) for up to 10 years following the initiation
  of laronidase therapy. RESULTS: Statistically significant (P < .001) reductions
  in mean urinary glycosaminoglycan levels relative to baseline were observed 6 months
  after treatment initiation and were sustained throughout follow-up. Disease remained
  stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean
  FVC, 6MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve
  function remained stable in 65% (22/34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable
  in 78% (18/23); visual acuity remained stable in 33% (8/24) and improved in 42%
  (10/24) of patients. Younger patients (<10 years at treatment initiation) maintained
  disease measures closer to norms for age for FVC, 6MWT, and height and showed fewer
  deteriorations in mitral and aortic valve disease and corneal clouding compared
  with patients aged >=10 years at treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: Laronidase treatment
  resulted in disease stabilization in the majority of patients with a mean follow-up
  of 6.1 years. Data suggest that early treatment may result in better outcomes.'
