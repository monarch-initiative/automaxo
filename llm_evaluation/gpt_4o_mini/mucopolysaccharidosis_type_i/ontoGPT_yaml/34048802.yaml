input_text: "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I-Associated Corneal Disease: A Clinicopathologic
  Study. PURPOSE: To report the anterior segment clinical features and histopathologic
  and histochemical characteristics of explanted corneas from the largest reported
  cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome and other variants of mucopolysaccharidosis
  (MPS) I undergoing corneal transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective observational
  case series. METHODS: This institutional study reviewed 15 corneas from 9 patients
  with MPS I spectrum disease who underwent corneal transplant to treat corneal clouding
  between May 2011 and October 2020. We reviewed the clinical data, hematoxylin-eosin-stained
  sections, and histochemical stains, including those for mucopolysaccharides (Alcian
  blue and/or colloidal iron). The main outcome measures were pathology observed under
  light microscopy and postsurgical clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent
  15 corneal transplants for corneal clouding (14/15 procedures were deep anterior
  lamellar keratoplasty). All corneas had mucopolysaccharide deposition visible on
  hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, which was highlighted in blue with histochemical
  stains. All corneas also showed alterations in Bowman's layer and the majority also
  showed epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSION: MPS I shows significant corneal clouding
  that is successfully treated with deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The excised
  corneas show characteristic epithelial changes, disruption or breaks in Bowman's
  membrane, and amphophilic collections of stromal granular mucopolysaccharides which
  are visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and highlighted by special histochemical
  stains (Alcian blue and collodial iron). These changes, although subtle, should
  alert the pathologist to the possibility of an underlying lysosomal storage disorder."
