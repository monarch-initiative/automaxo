input_text: 'Pentosan Polysulfate: Oral Versus Subcutaneous Injection in Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I Dogs. BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of
  pentosan polysulfate (PPS) in a rat model of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VI.
  Reduction of inflammation, reduction of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage, and improvement
  in the skeletal phenotype were shown. Herein, we evaluate the long-term safety and
  therapeutic effects of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, MPS
  I dogs. We focused on the arterial phenotype since this is one of the most consistent
  and clinically significant features of the model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
  MPS I dogs were treated with daily oral or biweekly subcutaneous (subQ) PPS at a
  human equivalent dose of 1.6 mg/kg for 17 and 12 months, respectively. Safety parameters
  were assessed at 6 months and at the end of the study. Following treatment, cytokine
  and GAG levels were determined in fluids and tissues. Assessments of the aorta and
  carotid arteries also were performed. No drug-related increases in liver enzymes,
  coagulation factors, or other adverse effects were observed. Significantly reduced
  IL-8 and TNF-alpha were found in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GAG reduction
  was observed in urine and tissues. Increases in the luminal openings and reduction
  of the intimal media thickening occurred in the carotids and aortas of PPS-treated
  animals, along with a reduction of storage vacuoles. These results were correlated
  with a reduction of GAG storage, reduction of clusterin 1 staining, and improved
  elastin integrity. No significant changes in the spines of the treated animals were
  observed. CONCLUSIONS: PPS treatment led to reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and GAG storage in urine and tissues of MPS I dogs, which were most evident after
  subQ administration. SubQ administration also led to significant cytokine reductions
  in the CSF. Both treatment groups exhibited markedly reduced carotid and aortic
  inflammation, increased vessel integrity, and improved histopathology. We conclude
  that PPS may be a safe and useful therapy for MPS I, either as an adjunct or as
  a stand-alone treatment that reduces inflammation and GAG storage.'
