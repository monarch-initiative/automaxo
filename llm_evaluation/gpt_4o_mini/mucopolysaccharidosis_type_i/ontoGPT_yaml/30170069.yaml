input_text: In vivo genome editing of mucopolysaccharidosis I mice using the CRISPR/Cas9
  system. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a multisystemic disorder caused
  by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) that leads to intracellular accumulation
  of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). In the present study we aimed to use cationic liposomes
  carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid and a donor vector for in vitro and in vivo MPS
  I gene editing, and compare to treatment with naked plasmids. The liposomal formulation
  was prepared by microfluidization. Complexes were obtained by the addition of DNA
  at +4/-1 charge ratio. The overall results showed complexes of about 110 nm, with
  positive zeta potential of +30 mV. The incubation of the complexes with fibroblasts
  from MPS I patients led to a significant increase in IDUA activity and reduction
  of lysosomal abnormalities. Hydrodynamic injection of the liposomal complex in newborn
  MPS I mice led to a significant increase in serum IDUA levels for up to six months.
  The biodistribution of complexes after hydrodynamic injection was markedly detected
  in the lungs and heart, corroborating the results of increased IDUA activity and
  decreased GAG storage especially in these tissues, while the group that received
  the naked plasmids presented increased enzyme activity especially in the liver.
  Furthermore, animals treated with the liposomal formulation presented improvement
  in cardiovascular parameters, one of the main causes of death observed in MPS I
  patients. We conclude that the IDUA production in multiple organs had a significant
  beneficial effect on the characteristics of MPS I disease, which may bring hope
  to gene therapy of Hurler patients.
