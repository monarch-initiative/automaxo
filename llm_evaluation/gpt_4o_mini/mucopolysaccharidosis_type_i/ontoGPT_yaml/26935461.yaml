input_text: 'Progression of Hip Dysplasia in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Hurler After
  Successful Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. BACKGROUND: Dysostosis multiplex
  contributes substantially to morbidity in patients with Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I Hurler phenotype [MPS I-H]), even after successful hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation (HSCT). One of the hallmarks of dysostosis multiplex in MPS I-H
  is hip dysplasia, which often requires surgical intervention. We sought to describe
  in detail the course of hip dysplasia in this group of patients, as assessed by
  radiographic analysis, and to identify potential outcome predictors. METHODS: Longitudinal
  data were obtained from digitally scored pelvic radiographs of patients with MPS
  I-H using OrthoGon software for parameters including, but not limited to, the acetabular
  index, migration percentage, Smith ratio, and neck-shaft angle. Scoring was performed
  independently by two blinded observers. Additional information on genotype, enzyme
  replacement therapy pre-HSCT, donor chimerism, and enzyme activity post-HSCT were
  obtained. General trends and potential correlations were calculated with mixed-model
  statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (192 radiographs) were included in this
  analysis. Intraobserver and interobserver variation analysis showed an intraclass
  correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 1.00. Among the twenty-one patients
  with follow-up beyond the age of five years, the acetabular index was in the range
  of severe hip dysplasia in up to 86% of the patients. Severe coxa valga was seen
  in 91% of the patients. Lateral and superior femoral displacement were highly prevalent,
  with the migration percentage outside the reference range in up to 96% of the patients.
  Finally, anterior pelvic tilt increased with age (p = 0.001). No correlations were
  identified between clinical parameters and radiographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  study shows that progressive acetabular dysplasia as well as coxa valga and hip
  displacement are highly prevalent and progressive over time in patients with MPS
  I-H, despite successful HSCT. These data may provide essential natural history determinations
  for the assessment of efficacy of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving
  skeletal outcomes in patients with MPS I-H.'
