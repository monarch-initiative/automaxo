input_text: 'Progressive eye pathology in mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice and effects
  of enzyme replacement therapy. BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)
  is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency, resulting
  in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Ophthalmological manifestations are
  common in MPS I patients and often lead to visual impairment. Accumulation of GAG
  in corneal or retinal tissues reduces vision causing corneal opacity and neurosensory
  complications. One available treatment for MPS I patients is enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT), but the results of such treatment on eye disease are still debatable.
  Therefore, we aimed to determine the progression of ocular manifestations as well
  as the effectiveness of intravenous ERT in MPS I. METHODS: Corneal and retinal analyses
  were perform in eyes from 2- to 8-month normal and MPS I mice. Some MPS I mice received
  ERT (1.2 mg/kg of laronidase) every 2 weeks from 6 to 8 months and histological
  findings were compared with controls. Additionally, cornea from two MPS I patients
  under ERT were evaluated. RESULTS: Mouse corneal tissues had GAG accumulation early
  in life. In the retina, we found a progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, starting
  at 6 months. ERT did not improve or stabilize the histological abnormalities. MPS
  I patients, despite being on ERT for over a decade, presented GAG accumulation in
  the cornea, corneal thickening, visual loss and needed corneal transplantation.
  CONCLUSION: We provide data on the time course of ocular alteration in MPS I mice.
  Our results also suggest that ERT is not effective in treating the progressive ocular
  manifestations in MPS I mice and fails to prevent corneal abnormalities in patients.'
