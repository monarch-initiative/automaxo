input_text: 'Neurocognitive and somatic stabilization in pediatric patients with severe
  Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I after 52 weeks of intravenous brain-penetrating insulin
  receptor antibody-iduronidase fusion protein (valanafusp alpha): an open label phase
  1-2 trial. BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type I (MPSI) is caused by mutations
  in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), and a majority
  of patients present with severe neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Recombinant
  IDUA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enable BBB transport, IDUA
  was re-engineered as an IgG-IDUA fusion protein, valanafusp alpha, where the IgG
  domain targets the BBB human insulin receptor to enable transport of the enzyme
  into the brain. We report the results of a 52-week clinical trial on the safety
  and efficacy of valanafusp alpha in pediatric MPSI patients with cognitive impairment.
  In the phase I trial, 6 adults with attenuated MPSI were administered 0.3, 1, and
  3 mg/kg doses of valanafusp alpha by intravenous (IV) infusion. In the phase II
  trial, 11 pediatric subjects, 2-15 years of age, were treated for 52 weeks with
  weekly IV infusions of valanafusp alpha at 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg. Assessments of adverse
  events, cognitive stabilization, and somatic stabilization were made. Outcomes at
  52 weeks were compared to baseline. RESULTS: Drug related adverse events included
  infusion related reactions, with an incidence of 1.7%, and transient hypoglycemia,
  with an incidence of 6.4%. The pediatric subjects had CNS involvement with a mean
  enrollment Development Quotient (DQ) of 36.1+-7.1. The DQ, and the cortical grey
  matter volume of brain, were stabilized by valanafusp alpha treatment. Somatic manifestations
  were stabilized, or improved, based on urinary glycosaminoglycan levels, hepatic
  and spleen volumes, and shoulder range of motion. CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence
  of the cognitive and somatic stabilization indicates that valanafusp alpha is transported
  into both the CNS and into peripheral organs due to its dual targeting mechanism
  via the insulin receptor and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. This novel fusion
  protein offers a pharmacologic approach to the stabilization of cognitive function
  in MPSI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.Gov, NCT03053089 . Retrospectively
