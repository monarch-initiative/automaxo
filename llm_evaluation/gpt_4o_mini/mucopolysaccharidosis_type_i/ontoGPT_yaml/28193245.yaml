input_text: "Early disease progression of Hurler syndrome. BACKGROUND: Newborn screening
  for mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) shows promise to improve outcomes by facilitating
  early diagnosis and treatment. However, diagnostic tests for MPS I are of limited
  value in predicting whether a child will develop severe central nervous system disease
  associated with Hurler syndrome, or minimal or no central nervous system involvement
  associated with the attenuated phenotypes (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes).
  Given that the optimal treatment differs between Hurler syndrome and the attenuated
  MPS I phenotypes, the absence of a reliable prognostic biomarker complicates clinical
  decision making for infants diagnosed through newborn screening. Information about
  the natural history of Hurler syndrome may aid in the management of affected infants,
  contribute to treatment decisions, and facilitate evaluation of treatment effectiveness
  and prognosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the progression and
  timing of symptom onset in infants with Hurler syndrome. RESULTS: Clinical data
  from 55 patients evaluated at a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Information
  about each child's medical history was obtained following a standardized protocol
  including a thorough parent interview and the review of previous medical records.
  All patients underwent systematic physical and neurodevelopmental evaluations by
  a multidisciplinary team. Nearly all patients (98%) showed signs of disease during
  the first 6 months of life. Common early disease manifestations included failed
  newborn hearing screen, respiratory symptoms, difficulty latching, and otitis media.
  Other symptoms such as kyphosis, corneal clouding, cardiac disease, joint restrictions,
  and enlarged head circumference typically appeared slightly later (median age, 8-10
  months). During the first 12 months, gross motor development was the most severely
  affected area of functioning, and a significant number of patients also experienced
  language delays. Cognition was typically preserved during this period. CONCLUSIONS:
  In this large cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome, the vast majority showed
  signs and symptoms of disease during the first months of life. More research is
  needed to determine the extent to which early clinical manifestations of MPS I can
  predict phenotype and treatment outcomes."
