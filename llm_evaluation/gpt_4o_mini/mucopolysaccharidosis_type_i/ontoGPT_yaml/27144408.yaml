input_text: 'IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity and Desensitisation with Recombinant Enzymes
  in Pompe Disease and Type I and Type VI Mucopolysaccharidosis. Enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) is important for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders. Hypersensitivity
  reactions with ERT have been reported, and in these cases, desensitisation with
  the enzyme is necessary. Here we report the cases of 3 patients with lysosomal storage
  disorders, including Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I and VI, who
  had IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions and positive skin tests. Successful
  desensitisation protocols with the culprit enzyme solution were used for these patients.
  All 3 patients were able to safely receive ERT with the desensitisation protocol. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
