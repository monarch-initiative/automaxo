input_text: 'Thalidomide as treatment of crohn-like disease occurred after allogeneic
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a pediatric patient. BACKGROUND: Autoimmune
  diseases may occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)
  and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD or Crohn disease) is rarely described. We describe
  a child who developed CD after allo-HSCT, successfully treated with thalidomide.
  CASE REPORT: A child affected by mucopolysaccharidosis type I received two allogeneic
  HSCTs for rejection after the first one. After cutaneous and intestinal chronic
  GvHD and 6 months after HSCT, the patients developed a trilinear autoimmune cytopenia
  successfully treated with rituximab and sirolimus. Due to persisting intestinal
  symptoms, colonoscopies were performed and histological findings demonstrated a
  picture of CD. Based on this observation and according to the recommendations for
  the treatment of CD, thalidomide was started. A complete stable clinical response
  was obtained 8 weeks after start of thalidomide. Colonoscopy performed 4.8 years
  later demonstrated a complete endoscopic and histological remission of CD. DISCUSSION:
  In this case, the diagnosis of CD after HSCT was based on histological findings.
  Indeed, repeated colonscopies were necessary for diagnosis, since both clinical
  and endoscopic features are often common to chronic GvHD and CD. Thalidomide was
  started at the dose of 1.7 mg/Kg/day, and it was well tolerated. Mild peripheral
  neurotoxicity occurred 5 years later but disappeared completely with the dose reduction.
  Currently, the patient is in complete remission from CD, despite the discontinuation
  of all the immunosuppressive therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide could represent
  a therapeutic option to treat CD as autoimmune disease after allogeneic HSCT.'
