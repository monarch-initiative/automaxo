input_text: Deleterious effects of interruption followed by reintroduction of enzyme
  replacement therapy on a lysosomal storage disorder. Temporary interruption of enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with different lysosomal storage disorders
  may happen for different reasons (adverse reactions, issues with reimbursement,
  logistic difficulties, and so forth), and the impact of the interruption is still
  uncertain. In the present work, we studied the effects of the interruption of intravenous
  ERT (Laronidase, Genzyme) followed by its reintroduction in mice with the prototypical
  lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type I, comparing to mice receiving
  continuous treatment, untreated mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice, and normal mice.
  In the animals which treatment was temporarily interrupted, we observed clear benefits
  of treatment in several organs (liver, lung, heart, kidney, and testis) after reintroduction,
  but a worsening in the thickness of the aortic wall was detected. Furthermore, these
  mice had just partial improvements in behavioral tests, suggesting some deterioration
  in the brain function. Despite worsening is some disease aspects, urinary glycosaminoglycans
  levels did not increase during interruption, which indicates that this biomarker
  commonly used to monitor treatment in patients should not be used alone to assess
  treatment efficacy. The deterioration observed was not caused by the development
  of serum antienzyme antibodies. All together our results suggest that temporary
  ERT interruption leads to deterioration of function in some organs and should be
  avoided whenever possible.
