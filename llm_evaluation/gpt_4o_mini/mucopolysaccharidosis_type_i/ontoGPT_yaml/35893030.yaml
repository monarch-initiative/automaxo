input_text: 'Early Neonatal Cardiac Phenotype in Hurler Syndrome: Case Report and
  Literature Review. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare inherited lysosomal
  disorder caused by deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme, resulting in the
  progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which interfere with the
  normal function of multiple tissues and organs. The clinical phenotype includes
  characteristic facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, umbilical
  and inguinal hernias, progressive cognitive deficits with corresponding hydrocephalus,
  and neuropathology. Untreated children do not survive into the second decade. The
  common cardiac phenotype seen in MPS I and other MPS types includes valve thickening
  and dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy-usually
  seen later in the disease course. A 15-month-old ex-35-weeker who presented with
  cardiomyopathy and left ventricular failure at the age of three weeks is presented
  here. Early evaluation and diagnosis with the help of newborn screening (NBS), followed
  by treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT), resulted in improvement of his cardiopulmonary status. In MPS I, an early
  cardiac phenotype is uncommon. Based on the evidence from the literature review
  for early neonatal cardiac phenotype, we propose that all infants with abnormal
  newborn screening for MPS I should receive cardiac screening with echocardiogram
  and NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) during the initial evaluation.'
