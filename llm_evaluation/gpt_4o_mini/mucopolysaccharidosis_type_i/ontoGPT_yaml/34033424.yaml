input_text: 'A few challenges in mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Here we describe the
  current challenges of mucopolysaccharidosis type I: the need for an adequate classification,
  establishing its relationship to therapeutic indications; an early diagnosis, from
  neonatal screening, its advantages and barriers, to clinical suspicion of severe
  and attenuated forms; spinal and eye disease care, from diagnosis to follow-up and
  treatment; allergic reactions caused by enzyme replacement therapy, their diagnosis
  and treatment. And lastly, transition to adult care.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
