input_text: 'Proposal of an Algorithm to Early Detect Attenuated Type I Mucopolysaccharidosis
  (MPS Ia) among Children with Growth Abnormalities. Background and Objectives: Diagnostic
  delay is common in attenuated Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS Ia) due to the rarity
  of the disease and the variability of clinical presentation. Short stature and impaired
  growth velocity are frequent findings in MPS Ia, but they rarely raise suspicion
  as paediatric endocrinologists are generally poorly trained to detect earlier and
  milder clinical signs of this condition. Materials and Methods: Following a consensus-based
  methodology, a multidisciplinary panel including paediatric endocrinologists, paediatricians
  with expertise in metabolic disorders, radiologists, and rheumatologists shared
  their experience on a possible clinical approach to the diagnosis of MPS Ia in children
  with short stature or stunted growth. Results: The result was the formation of an
  algorithm that illustrates how to raise the suspicion of MPS Ia in a patient older
  than 5 years with short stature and suggestive clinical signs. Conclusion: The proposed
  algorithm may represent a useful tool to improve the awareness of paediatric endocrinologists
  and reduce the diagnostic delay for patients with MPS Ia.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
