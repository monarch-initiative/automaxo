input_text: Intrastromal Gene Therapy Prevents and Reverses Advanced Corneal Clouding
  in a Canine Model of Mucopolysaccharidosis I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe phenotypes,
  including corneal clouding. MPS I is caused by mutations in alpha-l-iduronidase
  (IDUA), a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycosaminoglycans.
  Currently, no treatment exists to address MPS I corneal clouding other than corneal
  transplantation, which is complicated by a high risk for rejection. Investigation
  of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) IDUA gene addition strategy targeting the corneal
  stroma addresses this deficiency. In MPS I canines with early or advanced corneal
  disease, a single intrastromal AAV8G9-IDUA injection was well tolerated at all administered
  doses. The eyes with advanced disease demonstrated resolution of corneal clouding
  as early as 1 week post-injection, followed by sustained corneal transparency until
  the experimental endpoint of 25 weeks. AAV8G9-IDUA injection in the MPS I canine
  eye with early corneal disease prevented the development of advanced corneal changes
  while restoring clarity. Biodistribution studies demonstrated vector genomes in
  ocular compartments other than the cornea and in some systemic organs; however,
  a capsid antibody response was detected in only the highest dosed subject. Collectively,
  the results suggest that intrastromal AAV8G9-IDUA therapy prevents and reverses
  visual impairment associated with MPS I corneal clouding.
