input_text: "Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous
  enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond. BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency
  (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home
  therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This
  research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance
  of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme ) and Pompe Disease patients
  treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme ) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report
  herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a
  multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed
  38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort
  B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before
  enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort
  A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective
  of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of
  patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main
  reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%).
  Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as
  \"good\" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety
  profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use
  of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy."
