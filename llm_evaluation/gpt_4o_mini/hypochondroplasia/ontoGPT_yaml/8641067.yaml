input_text: Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy for the correction of tibia vara in
  the young. Proximal tibial osteotomy in the growing patient historically has been
  associated with a high rate of neurovascular complications and malunion. Here is
  reported a technique of valgus proximal tibial osteotomy, of the incomplete closing
  wedge type, that has avoided neurovascular compromise while achieving reliable correction
  and rapid bony union. Oblique proximal tibial valgus osteotomies with lateral tension
  plate fixation were performed on 18 tibiae in 14 patients (age range, 5-25 years)
  with tibia vara. The primary diagnosis was Blount's disease in 13 tibiae, achondroplasia
  in 2 tibiae, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia in 2 tibiae, and hypochondroplasia in
  1 tibia. No postoperative plaster immobilization was necessary. All patients were
  able to bear weight fully by 8 weeks after surgery. Average angular correction was
  18 degrees. One patient had overcorrection because of an unrecognized intraoperative
  fracture of the media] tibial cortex. There were no neurovascular complications.
  No growth disturbance of the proximal tibial physis was noted. Oblique proximal
  tibial osteotomy with tension plate fixation successfully corrected varus deformity
  of the proximal tibia in the growing patient without damage to the proximal tibial
  physis or neurovascular compromise.
