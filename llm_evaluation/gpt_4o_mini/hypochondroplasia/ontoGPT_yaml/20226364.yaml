input_text: 'Improving mobility in a client with hypochondroplasia (dwarfism): a case
  report. A client with hypochondroplasia dwarfism and a medical diagnosis of spinal
  stenosis had found that her ability to walk had decreased over the past 7 years
  from easily walking 6 miles (10 K) to now needing to rest every half block (171
  ft/52 m) due to muscle fatigue. Such weakness is consistent with nerve impingement
  due to spinal stenosis, which would not be improved by massage. However, during
  a preliminary assessment, it was found that both lower legs had severe fascial adhesions,
  possibly compressing lower leg blood vessels and nerves. It was hoped that by using
  myofascial massage techniques to relieve the adhesions, her mobility would improve
  over the course of 8 sessions. Myofascial massage techniques showed positive results
  in reducing adhesions, improving circulation, and increasing the distance the client
  could walk before resting to 2 blocks (686 ft/209 m). Working with this client showed
  that Licensed Massage Practitioners (LMPs) can easily accommodate clients of very
  short height.'
