input_text: '[Clinical condition and therapy of bone diseases]. Skeletal dysplasia
  is the term which represents disorders including growth and differentiation of bone,
  cartilage and ligament. A lot of diseases are included, and new disorders have been
  added. However, the therapy of most bone diseases is less well-established. Achondroplasia,
  hypochondroplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are most frequent bone diseases.
  There is no curative treatment for these diseases, however, supportive therapies
  are available ; for example, growth-hormone therapy for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia,
  and bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, enzyme replacement
  therapy for hypophosphatasia is now on clinical trial. '
