input_text: '[Growth hormone therapy in childhood. Growth hormone therapy in small
  children without growth hormone deficiency]. The availability of unlimited amounts
  of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has now made it possible to investigate
  its growth-promoting effect in children in whom growth hormone production is not
  deficient. In girls suffering from the Ullrich Turner syndrome, treatment with rhGH
  increases final height by some 6 to 8 cm. An increase in growth rate has also been
  observed in children with renal insufficiency, and in children with intrauterine
  growth retardation. Favourable results have also been reported in children receiving
  glucocorticoids for such chronic conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, and in youngsters
  with hypochondroplasia. In a further group of children with various disorders an
  improvement in the growth rate has been observed, although nothing can yet be said
  about the outcome in terms of final height. To achieve an increase in growth rate,
  pharmacological doses of growth hormone higher than those used in children with
  growth hormone deficiency are necessary. For this reason, the risk of unwanted side
  effects might be higher than in the latter.'
