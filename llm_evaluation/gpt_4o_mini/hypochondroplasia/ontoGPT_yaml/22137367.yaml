input_text: 'A pilot study of discontinuous, insulin-like growth factor 1-dosing growth
  hormone treatment in young children with FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia.
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the growth promoting effect of a recombinant growth hormone
  (rGH) treatment protocol adjusted on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) dosing
  in children affected by the most severe forms of FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia.
  STUDY DESIGN: Midterm results of an open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, 2003-2020
  pilot trial to final stature, including 6 children (mean age, 2.6 +- 0.7 years;
  mean height SDS, -3.0 +- 0.5) with the N540K mutation of FGFR3 gene who received
  an rGH dosage titrated to an IGF-1 level close to 1.5 SDS of the normal range. rGH
  therapy was interrupted 1 day per week, 1 month per year, and 6 months every 2 years.
  RESULTS: The mean height SDS increased by 1.9 during the 6.1 +- 0.9-year study period,
  reaching -0.8 to -1.3 at age 8.7 +- 1 years. The mean+-SDS baseline IGF-1 value
  was -1.6 +- 0.5 before rGH treatment and 1.4+-0.3 during the last year of observation.
  The average cumulative rGH dose was 0.075 +- 0.018 mg/kg/day (range, 0.059-0.100
  mg/kg/day). Trunk/leg disproportion was improved. CONCLUSION: IGF-1-dosing rGH treatment
  durably improves growth and reduces body disproportion in children with severe forms
  of hypochondroplasia.'
