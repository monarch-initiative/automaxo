input_text: 'Medulloblastoma in children with Fanconi anemia: Association with FA-D1/FA-N,
  SHH type and poor survival independent of treatment strategies. BACKGROUND: Outcome
  of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA
  repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated
  by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data
  are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and
  molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including
  detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA
  MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified
  22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup
  reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients.
  FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N
  (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy
  (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related
  toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients
  treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less
  toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival
  (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged
  survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2%
  with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly
  associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant
  therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in
  selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative
  therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.'
