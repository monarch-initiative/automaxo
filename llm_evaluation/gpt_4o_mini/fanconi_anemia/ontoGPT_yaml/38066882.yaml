input_text: 'Posttransplant complications in patients with marrow failure syndromes:
  are we improving long-term outcomes? Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)
  encompass a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure,
  non-hematologic multisystemic comorbidities, disease defining congenital anomalies,
  and a susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and in
  some instances solid tumors. The most common IBMFS include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond
  syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and telomere biology disorders/ dyskeratosis
  congenita. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established
  curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt
  or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances
  in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number
  of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects
  from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural
  history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation
  of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated
  and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced
  toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify
  the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often
  included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT
  outcomes within IBMFS.'
