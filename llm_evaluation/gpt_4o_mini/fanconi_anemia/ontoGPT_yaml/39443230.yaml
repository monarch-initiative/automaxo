input_text: 'Genetic predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome: Genetic counseling
  and transplant implications. The development of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
  is influenced by various genetic predispositions. Several important genes contribute
  to disease susceptibility. This paper explores common genetic predisposition genes
  in MDS, including DDX41, CEBPA, and SAMD9/SAMD9L, which are linked to hereditary
  conditions presenting diagnostic and clinical challenges. It delves into hereditary
  conditions that affect platelet production and count, such as RUNX1, ETV6, and ANKRD26,
  detailing their clinical features and how they contribute to an increased risk of
  MDS. The discussion extends to additional genetic syndromes like GATA2 deficiency,
  telomere biology disorders, Fanconi anemia, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, along with
  new findings on genes like ERG that offer new insights into disease etiology. The
  importance of genetic counseling in MDS is underscored, outlining its goals, methods
  for evaluating family history, risk assessment, and the ethical considerations involved.
  Furthermore, the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation in managing MDS, particularly
  in patients with germline syndromes, is reviewed, emphasizing the need for optimal
  donor selection and personalized treatment approaches. This comprehensive overview
  illustrates the critical role of genetic factors in MDS and highlights the need
  for continued research and tailored clinical practices to improve patient outcomes.'
