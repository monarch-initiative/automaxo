input_text: Human Mastadenovirus A Infection in a Child During the Course of Hematopoietic
  Stem Cell Transplant. Following primary infection, human mastadeno- viruses can
  persist in various tissues. We report a case of a pediatric patient with Fanconi
  anemia who had a complicated posttransplant course after allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant that was associated with human mastadenovirus infection. Human
  mastadenovirus reactivation was detected with metagenomic analysis during a 3-month
  follow- up period; the predominant rate of occurrence of human mastadenoviruses
  was 1.1% on day 0, 84% on day +15, 90% on day +30, and 42% on day +82. Virus shedding
  continued up to 3 months after transplant. At 36 months after hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant, the patient was in good clinical condition with full donor chimerism.
  Long-term follow-up studies for human mastadenoviruses are needed to determine latency
  period.
