input_text: The Fanconi anemia ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as an anti-cancer target.
  Agents that induce DNA damage can cure some cancers. However, the side effects of
  chemotherapy are severe because of the indiscriminate action of DNA-damaging agents
  on both healthy and cancerous cells. DNA repair pathway inhibition provides a less
  toxic and targeted alternative to chemotherapy. A compelling DNA repair target is
  the Fanconi anemia (FA) E3 ligase core complex due to its critical-and likely singular-role
  in the efficient removal of specific DNA lesions. FA pathway inactivation has been
  demonstrated to specifically kill some types of cancer cells without the addition
  of exogenous DNA damage, including cells that lack BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, or functionally
  related genes. In this perspective, we discuss the genetic and biochemical evidence
  in support of the FA core complex as a compelling drug target for cancer therapy.
  In particular, we discuss the genetic, biochemical, and structural data that could
  rapidly advance our capacity to identify and implement the use of FA core complex
  inhibitors in the clinic.
