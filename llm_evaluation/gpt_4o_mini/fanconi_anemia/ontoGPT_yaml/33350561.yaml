input_text: A case series of medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia following
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia. Systemic medications
  categorized as diphenylhydantoin, calcineurin inhibitor and calcium channel blocker
  may have effects on the oral cavity by modifying the inflammatory and immune response
  and causing undesired tissue proliferative reactions. Calcineurin inhibitors are
  medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related
  fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth
  associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients
  (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented
  similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital
  and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described
  them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the
  patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH.
  Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is
  fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and
  correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological
  findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation
  should be "medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia". The correct nomenclature
  related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications
  with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate
  scientific communication and improve the treatment.
