input_text: 'Successful sequential liver and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in a patient with Fanconi anemia. BACKGROUND: In Fanconi anemia bone marrow failure
  is the major cause of morbidity and mortality and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  represents the only curative treatment. Liver disease, in terms of elevated liver
  function tests, as well as benign and malignant liver tumors, occurs especially
  in case of androgen treatment. We report a unique case of a child with Fanconi anemia
  with FANCD2 mutation who developed neonatal cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and bone
  marrow failure. The child successfully underwent sequential liver transplantation
  and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the first 2 years of life. Nineteen
  months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 30 months after liver transplantation,
  the patient is clinically well with normal hematopoietic function and excellent
  liver function. CONCLUSION: This is the first FA patient who successfully received
  sequential LT and HSCT highlighting that successful sequential transplantation is
  feasible in Fanconi anemia patients.'
