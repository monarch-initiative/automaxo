input_text: '[STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH FANCONI ANEMIA: AN ISRAELI
  TERTIARY CENTER EXPERIENCE]. INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic
  syndrome characterized by increased chromosomal breakage, congenital anomalies,
  bone marrow failure and an increased tendency to develop malignancies. Allogeneic
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for
  bone marrow failure and the hematologic malignancies these patients develop. Given
  the sensitivity of FA patients to chemotherapy and radiation, as to the clinical
  symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), HSCT in these patients is challenging.
  Since the mid-nineties, HSCT for FA patients is performed in our center by using
  the fludarabine based reduced-intensity protocol. AIMS: To summarize the results
  of HSCT for patients with FA using a fludarabine based reduced-intensity conditioning
  regimen at the Hadassah Medical Center. METHODS: This retrospective research is
  based on the collection and analysis of clinical and laboratory data from the medical
  records of patients. RESULTS: Since June 1996 up till February 2020, 39 patients
  with FA underwent 43 HSCTs with a fludarabine based protocol at the Hadassah Medical
  Center. Four patients required a second transplant due to primary engraftment failure.
  Nine patients (23%) suffered from acute GvHD, four of them severe. Eight patients
  (20%) developed chronic GvHD, two with an extensive and debilitating disease. Thirty-three
  (85%) of the patients survived and six died, five shortly after the transplant,
  and one twenty years later from malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show high survival
  rates with low rates of engraftment failure and reasonable rates of GvHD. DISCUSSION:
  As of today, there is an effective and safe treatment for patients with FA who require
  HSCT by using a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with high
  survival rates and few complications.'
