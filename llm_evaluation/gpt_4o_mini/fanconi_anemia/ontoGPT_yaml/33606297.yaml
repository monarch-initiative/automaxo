input_text: 'Haplo-identical or mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation
  for Fanconi anemia: Results from the Severe Aplastic Anemia Working Party of the
  EBMT. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option
  for bone marrow failure or hematopoietic malignant diseases for Fanconi anemia (FA)
  patients. Although results have improved over the last decades, reaching more than
  90% survival when a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is available,
  alternative HCT donors are still less reported. We compared HCT outcomes using HLA-mismatched
  unrelated donors (MMUD; n = 123) or haplo-identical donors (HDs), either using only
  in vivo T cell depletion (n = 33) or T cells depleted in vivo with some type of
  graft manipulation ex vivo (n = 59) performed for FA between 2000 and 2018. Overall
  survival (OS) by 24 months was 62% (53-71%) for MMUD, versus 80% (66-95%) for HDs
  with only in vivo T cell depletion and 60% (47-73%) for HDs with in vivo and ex
  vivo T cell depletion (p = .22). Event-free survival (EFS) was better for HD-transplanted
  FA patients with only in vivo T cell depletion 86% (73-99%) than for those transplanted
  from a MMUD 58% (48-68%) or those with graft manipulation 56% (42-69%) (p = .046).
  Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41% (MMUD) versus 40% (HDs
  with no graft manipulation) versus 17% (HDs with T cell depleted graft), (p = .005).
  No differences were found for the other transplant related outcomes. These data
  suggest that HDs might be considered as an alternative option for FA patients with
  better EFS using unmanipulated grafts.'
