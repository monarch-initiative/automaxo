input_text: "Tongue cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation for Fanconi
  anemia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence
  and the clinical outcome of tongue cancer (TC) in patients affected by Fanconi anemia
  (FA) who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara
  was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data
  were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS:
  Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related
  causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7
  years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no
  patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence
  function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy
  alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed
  by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized
  by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer
  progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis
  of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular
  tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long
  maintained. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Considering the rarity of FA and the frailty of
  FA patients, this study may add important information for the cancer management
  of these patients."
