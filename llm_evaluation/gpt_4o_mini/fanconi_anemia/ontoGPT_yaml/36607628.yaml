  Long Noncoding RNAs. STUDY DESIGN: A functional, transcriptome, and long noncoding
  RNAs (lncRNAs) expression analysis in the spinal cord of mice after hyperbaric oxygen
  (HBO) treatment. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats
  spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense
  amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of
  neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified.
  METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and
  analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI,
  and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups
  was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential
  expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis
  showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication,
  synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase
  activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment
  analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication,
  lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal
  pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1,
  NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between
  the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the
  first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord
  after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this
  setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats
  SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.'
