input_text: 'Recommendations for pregnancy in Fanconi anemia. Introduction: Fanconi
  anemia (FA) is a rare congenital disease that belongs to the family of congenital
  trilinear bone marrow failure. Most FA patients will suffer bone marrow failure
  and the main treatment relies on supportive measures or more recently on the use
  of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The improvements seen in the management of
  FA has led women to reach childbearing age and have successful pregnancies. However,
  these pregnancies are associated with increased complications such as preterm delivery,
  cesarean delivery, eclampsia and others.Areas covered: This review highlights on
  the outcome of pregnancies in FA patients reported in the literature along with
  practical recommendations.Expert opinion: Multidisciplinary efforts are required
  to optimize the management of pregnancy in FA patients. Moreover, the development
  of a set of recommendations to optimize the treatment is highly necessary.'
