input_text: LNK (SH2B3) inhibition expands healthy and Fanconi anemia human hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains
  the only curative treatment for a variety of hematological diseases. Allogenic HSCT
  requires hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from matched donors and comes with cytotoxicity
  and mortality. Recent advances in genome modification of HSCs have demonstrated
  the possibility of using autologous HSCT-based gene therapy to alleviate hematologic
  symptoms in monogenic diseases, such as the inherited bone marrow failure (BMF)
  syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). However, for FA and other BMF syndromes, insufficient
  HSC numbers with functional defects results in delayed hematopoietic recovery and
  increased risk of graft failure. We and others previously identified the adaptor
  protein LNK (SH2B3) as a critical negative regulator of murine HSC homeostasis.
  However, whether LNK controls human HSCs has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate
  that depletion of LNK via lentiviral expression of miR30-based short hairpin RNAs
  results in robust expansion of transplantable human HSCs that provided balanced
  multilineage reconstitution in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Importantly,
  LNK depletion enhances cytokine-mediated JAK/STAT activation in CD34+ hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, we demonstrate that LNK depletion expands
  primary HSPCs associated with FA. In xenotransplant, engraftment of FANCD2-depleted
  FA-like HSCs was markedly improved by LNK inhibition. Finally, targeting LNK in
  primary bone marrow HSPCs from FA patients enhanced their colony forming potential
  in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of targeting LNK to
  expand HSCs to improve HSCT and HSCT-based gene therapy.
