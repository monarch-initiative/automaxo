input_text: Division of labor within the DNA damage tolerance system reveals non-epistatic
  and clinically actionable targets for precision cancer medicine. Crosslink repair
  depends on the Fanconi anemia pathway and translesion synthesis polymerases that
  replicate over unhooked crosslinks. Translesion synthesis is regulated via ubiquitination
  of PCNA, and independently via translesion synthesis polymerase REV1. The division
  of labor between PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 in interstrand crosslink repair is
  unclear. Inhibition of either of these pathways has been proposed as a strategy
  to increase cytotoxicity of platinating agents in cancer treatment. Here, we defined
  the importance of PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 for DNA in mammalian ICL repair.
  In mice, loss of PCNA-ubiquitination, but not REV1, resulted in germ cell defects
  and hypersensitivity to cisplatin. Loss of PCNA-ubiquitination, but not REV1 sensitized
  mammalian cancer cell lines to cisplatin. We identify polymerase Kappa as essential
  in tolerating DNA damage-induced lesions, in particular cisplatin lesions. Polk-deficient
  tumors were controlled by cisplatin treatment and it significantly delayed tumor
  outgrowth and increased overall survival of tumor bearing mice. Our results indicate
  that PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 play distinct roles in DNA damage tolerance. Moreover,
  our results highlight POLK as a critical TLS polymerase in tolerating multiple genotoxic
  lesions, including cisplatin lesions. The relative frequent loss of Polk in cancers
  indicates an exploitable vulnerability for precision cancer medicine.
