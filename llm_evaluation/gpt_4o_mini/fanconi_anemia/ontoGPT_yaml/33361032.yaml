input_text: "Whole exome sequencing identifies a novel FANCD2 gene splice site mutation
  associated with disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia: Implication in
  targeted therapy of advanced phase CML. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly
  improved the clinical outcome of BCR-ABL+ Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
  (CP-CML). Nonetheless, approximately one-third of the CP-CML patient's progress
  to advanced phases of CML (accelerated and blast phase). Impaired DNA repair including
  mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of
  many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid
  cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with
  CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along
  with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2
  is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first
  report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel
  marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies
  are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can
  provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination
  TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved
  anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome
  CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease."
