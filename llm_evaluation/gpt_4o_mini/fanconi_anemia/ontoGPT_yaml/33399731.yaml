input_text: 'Outcomes in pediatrics patients diagnosed with bone marrow failure disorders
  treated in a tertiary care center. INTRODUCTION: Bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes
  are rare disorders with an annual incidence of 2-4 cases per million. Treatment
  options include immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with
  BMF treated in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study
  of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF who consulted at Fundacion Valle de Lili,
  Cali. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed according to Acquired BMF (ABMF)
  and Inherited BMF (IBMF). The outcomes include treatment, complications, overall
  survival (OS) in transplant patients, calculated using the Kaplan Meier method.
  RESULTS: We included 24 patients with BMF, average age 6.5 +- 4 years, and 50% were
  women. 58% presented IBMF, 9 with Fanconi anemia (FA), 2 dyskeratosis congenita,
  2 congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and 1 presented Diamond-Blackfan
  anemia. 12 patients treated with HSCT had a 5-year OS of 83%. ABMF represented 42%.
  6 patients received IST-HSCT, 3 received IST, and 1 received HSCT. The OS of the
  IST-HSCT group was 86%. Six patients died, four of them related to infection. CONCLUSIONS:
  In this series, there was a higher number of cases with IBMF. The OS of patients
  treated with HSCT is similar to that reported in recent studies. The most frequent
  cause of death was of infectious origin which has also been previously reported.
  The treatment esta blished in the patients showed favorable results in a Latin American
  tertiary care center.'
