input_text: 'Pathological evaluation of renal complications in children following
  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective cohort study.
  BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a
  curative therapy for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant disorders, such
  as aplastic anemia, fanconi anemia, and certain immune deficiencies. Post-transplantation
  kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide spectrum of structural
  abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis;
  FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis;
  MCD, minimal change disease), vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or
  tubulointerstitial (TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury).
  Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of
  kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little
  is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients.
  METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney
  injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10
  years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria
  indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d),
  nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <
  30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT).
  The main pathologies identified from kidney biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n
  = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD (n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF,
  n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or combined with other pathologies. The median
  follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy
  and/or severe infection, one child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD),
  six patients (24%) had elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100micromol/l) and nine
  patients (36%) still had proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates histomorphologic
  findings from kidney biopsies of pediatric recipients following allo-HSCT. Detailed
  evaluation of renal biopsy samples is helpful to elucidate the nature of renal insult,
  and may potentially identify treatable disease processes.'
