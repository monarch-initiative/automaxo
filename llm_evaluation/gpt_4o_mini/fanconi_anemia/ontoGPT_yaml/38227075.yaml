input_text: HLA-haploidentical T-cell receptor alphabetaT/B-cell-depleted stem cell
  transplantation for Fanconi anemia. HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation
  (haplo-SCT) using post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) is an alternative
  choice when a suitable donors is unavailable. However, PT-CY is difficult in patients
  with Fanconi anemia (FA) due to their high vulnerability to alkylating agents. For
  FA, we prefer haplo-SCT by T-cell receptor alphabetaT-cell and B-cell depletion
  (alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT), which can reduce the risks of PT-CY-related complications
  and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An 11-year-old boy with diagnosed FA (FANCG
  mutation) and bone marrow failure was to receive alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT
  from his father (HLA 4/8 allele matched) due to absence of an HLA-matched donors.
  alphabetaT/B-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (CD34 + cell count, 1.17 x 107/kg;
  alphabeta + T-cell count, 1.3 x 105/kg) were infused following conditioning consisting
  of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin
  (5 mg/kg), rituximab (375 mg/m2), and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (3 Gy). Tacrolimus
  was used for GVHD prophylaxis until day + 30. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved
  on day + 9, and complete chimerism was confirmed on days + 28 and + 96. At 12-month
  post-SCT, the patient was well without GVHD or any other complications. alphabetaT/B-depleted
  haplo-SCT is a good choice not only for patients unsuitable for PT-CY, but also
  for all pediatric recipients to reduce SCT-related complications.
