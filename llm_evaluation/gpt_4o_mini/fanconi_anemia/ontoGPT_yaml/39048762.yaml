input_text: 'MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement: The risk of secondary oral cancer
  following hematopoietic cell transplantation. PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice
  Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates
  practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer
  patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic
  cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation
  of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts,
  members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented
  in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard
  of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer
  (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly
  in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases
  over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer
  risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the
  higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong
  oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting
  lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of)
  cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous
  follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence
  of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions
  should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.'
