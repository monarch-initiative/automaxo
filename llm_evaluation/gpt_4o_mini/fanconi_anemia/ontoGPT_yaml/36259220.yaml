input_text: 'Two decades of stem cell transplantation in patients with Fanconi anemia:
  Analysis of factors affecting transplant outcomes. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for the hematological
  complications of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). Over the last two decades, HSCT
  outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored
  for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data
  of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November
  1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up
  time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute
  graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed
  chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable
  mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them
  had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants
  from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p
  = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable
  between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival
  rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet
  engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor
  and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate
  the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between
  matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors
  that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism
  status.'
