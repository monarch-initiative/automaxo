input_text: "In Vivo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Genome Editing: Perspectives and Limitations.
  The tremendous evolution of genome-editing tools in the last two decades has provided
  innovative and effective approaches for gene therapy of congenital and acquired
  diseases. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator- like effector nucleases
  (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 have been already applied by ex vivo hematopoietic stem
  cell (HSC) gene therapy in genetic diseases (i.e., Hemoglobinopathies, Fanconi anemia
  and hereditary Immunodeficiencies) as well as infectious diseases (i.e., HIV), and
  the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems using base and prime editors
  as well as epigenome editors has provided safer tools for gene therapy. The ex vivo
  approach for gene addition or editing of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically
  challenging, costly and not free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise
  to transform gene therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a \"user-friendly'
  approach to eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially
  affordable treatment modality. In the present review article, based on the lessons
  gained by more than 3 decades of ex vivo HSC gene therapy, we discuss the concept,
  the tools, the progress made and the challenges to clinical translation of in vivo
  HSC gene editing."
