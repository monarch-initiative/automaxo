input_text: Does Mixed Chimerism After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
  in Pediatric Patients With Fanconi Anemia Impact on Outcome? Fanconi anemia (FA)
  cells are characterized by genomic instability, which places FA patients at risk
  for malignancies such as leukemia and oropharyngeal/urogenital cancers. The risk
  of development of leukemia is theoretically eliminated after hematopoietic cell
  transplantation (HCT). Mixed chimerism (MC) in FA patients might have a unique implication
  because the persistent existence of FA cells might give rise to a malignant clone.
  We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at
  our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients
  with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion
  dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study.
  Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia
  were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time
  of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our
  center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data
  at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this
  analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%)
  had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%)
  exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades
  acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD
  was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute
  GVHD (grade >= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with
  FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the
  last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100
  group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00).
  At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range,
  19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years
  was 95.7% +- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year
  overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day
  +100 (95.7% +- 3.0% versus 95.6% +- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up
  (96.0% +- 2.8% versus 95.4% +- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group
  developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism
  in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up
  period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of
  this statement.
