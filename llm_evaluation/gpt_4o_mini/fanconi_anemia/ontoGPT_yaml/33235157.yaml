input_text: Care Coordination in a SARS-CoV-2-infected Child With Newly Diagnosed
  Medulloblastoma and Fanconi Anemia. COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for a global pandemic that can
  cause severe infections in children, especially those with comorbid conditions.
  Here, we report a case of a child with a newly diagnosed medulloblastoma, Fanconi
  Anemia, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through multidisciplinary care coordination and
  meticulous planning, we were able to safely initiate this patient's oncology care
  and implement a long-term model to address the patient's care. This approach could
  be replicated with any newly diagnosed pediatric patient that requires monitoring
  for signs of COVID-19 with concurrent oncology care.
