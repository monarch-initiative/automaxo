input_text: 'A new step in understanding stem cell mobilization in patients with Fanconi
  anemia: A bridge to gene therapy. BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited
  disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone
  marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA,
  via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions
  and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate
  harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene
  therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly
  challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates
  the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients
  with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use
  them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received
  two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24
  mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+
  cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor
  injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization
  peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term
  adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION:
  Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor
  is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.'
