input_text: 'Molecular Monitoring of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Fanconi
  Anemia. BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is
  the treatment of choice in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). The aim of our study
  is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case
  of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2
  months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood
  samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood
  samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA)
  with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification,
  the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR
  system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers
  was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex
  PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI
  3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation,
  a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived
  hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained
  with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring
  after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation
  complications such as graft versus host disease.'
