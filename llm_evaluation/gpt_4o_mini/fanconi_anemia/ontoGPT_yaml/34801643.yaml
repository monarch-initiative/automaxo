input_text: Translational research for bone marrow failure patients. Bone marrow failure
  syndromes encompass a range of inherited and acquired hematological diseases that
  result in insufficient blood cell production, which leads to severe complications
  including anemia, weakening of the immune system, impaired coagulation, and increased
  risk of cancer. Within inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a number of genetically
  distinct diseases have been described including Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and Fanconi
  anemia. Given the genetic complexity and poor prognosis of these inherited bone
  marrow failure syndromes, there is increasing interest in both characterizing the
  genetic landscapes of these diseases and developing novel gene therapies to effectively
  monitor and cure patients. These topics were the focus of the winter 2021 International
  Society for Experimental Hematology New Investigator Webinar, which featured presentations
  by Dr. Akiko Shimamura and Dr. Paula Rio. Here, we review the topics covered within
  this webinar.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
