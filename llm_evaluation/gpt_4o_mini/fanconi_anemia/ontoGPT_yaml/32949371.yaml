input_text: 'Long-term outcome in patients with Fanconi anemia who received hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation: a retrospective nationwide analysis. We retrospectively
  analyzed nationwide records of 163 Fanconi anemia (FA) patients [aplastic anemia
  (AA), n = 118; myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), n = 30; acute leukemia, n = 15] who
  underwent first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between
  1987 and 2015 in Japan. An alternative donor was used in 119 (73%) patients, and
  160 (98%) patients received a non-T-cell-depleted graft. With an 8.7-year median
  follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81%. The 5-year OS was significantly
  higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%,
  respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in
  univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>= 18 years), conditioning regimen without
  anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease.
  After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12
  were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen
  and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven
  deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT.
  On the basis of the risk factors for HSCT in MDS/leukemia patients and subsequent
  malignancies, a more effective HSCT approach is required.'
