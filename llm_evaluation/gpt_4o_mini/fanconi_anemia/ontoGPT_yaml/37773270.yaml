input_text: T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for the
  treatment of Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML. The only curative approach for myelodysplastic
  syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising in patients with Fanconi
  anemia (FA) is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT); however,
  HCT approaches are inconsistent and limited data on outcomes exist. We retrospectively
  evaluated outcomes of thirty patients with FA and MDS/AML who underwent first allogeneic
  HCT with a T-cell depleted (TCD) graft at our institution. Patients were transplanted
  on successive protocols with stepwise changes in cytoreduction and GVHD prophylaxis.
  All but two patients (93%) experienced durable hematopoietic engraftment. With median
  follow-up of 8.7 years, 5-year OS was 66.8% and DFS 53.8%. No significant differences
  in survival were found in patients with high-risk prognostic features (age >=20
  years, AML diagnosis, alternative donor graft) or when stratified by conditioning
  regimen. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were 24.3% and 21.9%,
  respectively. NRM was higher in patients >=20 years at HCT but did not otherwise
  differ. We herein demonstrate promising outcomes following allogeneic HCT for patients
  with FA and MDS/AML using TCD grafts, particularly in a cohort of high-risk patients
  with 50% >=20 years and a majority receiving mismatched grafts. Future prospective
  studies are needed to compare this approach with other HCT platforms.
