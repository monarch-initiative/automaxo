input_text: 'Oral Premalignant and Malignant Lesions in Fanconi Anemia Patients. OBJECTIVE:
  There is a lack of data supporting cancer surveillance in pediatric Fanconi Anemia
  patients. We sought to describe the rates of upper aerodigestive lesions and malignancy
  in this population to augment current management guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective
  cohort study of patients with Fanconi Anemia from a quaternary referral center between
  2007-2021 was completed for head and neck cancer risk. RESULTS: One hundred and
  five FA patients were reviewed. Average age at presentation was 11.3 years old and
  90.5% of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A total of
  8.6% of patients had leukoplakia or erythroplakia and 3.8% developed malignancy.
  The standardized incidence ratio of head and neck malignancy was 483.8. Patients
  presented with leukoplakia and malignancy at an average age of 14.6 and 25.1 years
  old, respectively. Malignancies were aggressive and marked by recurrence. There
  were no premalignant or malignant lesions found on flexible laryngoscopy. This series
  represents the largest longitudinal series of pediatric FA head and neck lesions.
  CONCLUSIONS: Fanconi Anemia patients should begin screening for head and neck cancer
  at age 10 or after HSCT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Laryngoscope, 2022.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
