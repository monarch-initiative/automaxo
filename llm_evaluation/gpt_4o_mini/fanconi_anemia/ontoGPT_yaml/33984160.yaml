input_text: Natural gene therapy by reverse mosaicism leads to improved hematology
  in Fanconi anemia patients. Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by chromosome fragility,
  bone marrow failure (BMF) and predisposition to cancer. As reverse genetic mosaicism
  has been described as "natural gene therapy" in patients with FA, we sought to evaluate
  the clinical course of a cohort of FA mosaic patients followed at referral centers
  in Spain over a 30-year period. This cohort includes patients with a majority of
  T cells without chromosomal aberrations in the DEB-chromosomal breakage test. Relative
  to non-mosaic FA patients, we observed a higher proportion of adult patients in
  the cohort of mosaics, with a later age of hematologic onset and a milder evolution
  of (BMF). Consequently, the requirement for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
  was also lower. Additional studies allowed us to identify a sub-cohort of mosaic
  FA patients in whom the reversion was present in bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells
  leading to multilineage mosaicism. These multilineage mosaic patients are older,
  have a lower percentage of aberrant cells, have more stable hematology and none
  of them developed leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome when compared to non-mosaics.
  In conclusion, our data indicate that reverse mosaicism is a good prognostic factor
  in FA and is associated with more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.
