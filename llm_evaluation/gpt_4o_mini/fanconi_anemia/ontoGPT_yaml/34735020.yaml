input_text: 'Fanconi anemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant as risk factors
  for oral squamous cell carcinoma: A case report with a 12-year follow-up. Fanconi
  anemia is a rare disorder resulting from defects in genes responsible for DNA damage
  responses. It is characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia, and a predisposition
  to cancer. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative
  treatment available for bone marrow failure; however, HSCT increases oral squamous
  cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk. Here we report the case of a patient diagnosed with
  Fanconi anemia in childhood who was treated with HSCT and later diagnosed with multiple
  OSCCs during a 12-year follow-up. Despite multiple surgical interventions and radiotherapy
  regimens, the patient`s health deteriorated. Management of individuals with Fanconi
  anemia is challenging and must be provided by a multidisciplinary healthcare team
  to ensure better staging, treatment planning, and coordination.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
