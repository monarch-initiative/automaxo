input_text: 'HLA-haploidentical TCRalphabeta+/CD19+-depleted stem cell transplantation
  in children and young adults with Fanconi anemia. We report on the outcome of 24
  patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) lacking an HLA matched related or unrelated donor,
  given an HLA-haploidentical T-cell receptor alphabeta (TCRalphabeta+) and CD19+
  cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the context of a
  prospective, single-center phase 2 trial. Sustained primary engraftment was achieved
  in 22 (91.6%) of 24 patients, with median time to neutrophil recovery of 12 days
  (range, 9-15 days) and platelet recovery of 10 days (range, 7-14 days). Cumulative
  incidences of grade 1 to 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD
  were 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5%-35.5%) and 5.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-33.4%),
  respectively. The conditioning regimen, which included fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide
  and, in most patients, single-dose irradiation was well tolerated; no fatal transplant-related
  toxicity was observed. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 0.3-8.7 years),
  the overall and event-free survival probabilities were 100% and 86.3% (95% CI, 62.8%-95.4%),
  respectively (2 graft failures and 1 case of poor graft function were considered
  as events). The 2 patients who experienced primary graft failure underwent a subsequent
  successful HSCT from the other parent. This is the first report of FA patients given
  TCRalphabeta+/CD19+-depleted haplo-HSCT in the context of a prospective trial, and
  the largest series of T-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT in FA reported to date. This trial
  was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01810120.'
