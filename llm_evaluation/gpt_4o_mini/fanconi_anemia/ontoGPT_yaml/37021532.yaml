input_text: Gene therapy restores the transcriptional program of hematopoietic stem
  cells in Fanconi anemia. Clinical trials have shown that lentiviral-mediated gene
  therapy can ameliorate bone marrow failure (BMF) in non-conditioned Fanconi anemia
  (FA) patients resulting from the proliferative advantage of corrected FA HSPCs,
  however it is yet unknown if gene therapy can revert affected molecular pathways
  in diseased HSPCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in chimeric populations
  of corrected and uncorrected HSPCs coexisting in the BM of gene therapy treated
  FA patients. Our study demonstrates that gene therapy reverts the transcriptional
  signature of FA HSPCs, which then resembles the transcriptional program of healthy
  donor HSPCs. This includes a downregulated expression of TGF-beta and p21, typically
  upregulated in FA HSPCs, and upregulation of DNA damage response and telomere maintenance
  pathways. Our results show for the first time the potential of gene therapy to rescue
  defects in the HSPC transcriptional program from patients with inherited diseases,
  in this case in FA characterized by BMF and cancer predisposition.
