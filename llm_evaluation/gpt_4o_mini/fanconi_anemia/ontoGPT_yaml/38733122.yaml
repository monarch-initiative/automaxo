input_text: 'Long-term combination therapy with metformin and oxymetholone in a Fanconi
  anemia mouse model. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease caused by defective deoxyribonucleic
  acid (DNA) repair that manifests as bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition,
  and developmental defects. We previously reported that monotherapy with either metformin
  (MET) or oxymetholone (OXM) improved peripheral blood (PB) counts and the number
  and functionality of bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) number
  in Fancd2-/- mice. To evaluate whether the combination treatment of these drugs
  has a synergistic effect to prevent bone marrow failure in FA, we treated cohorts
  of Fancd2-/- mice and wildtype controls with either MET alone, OXM alone, MET+OXM,
  or placebo diet from age 3 weeks to 18 months. The OXM treated animals showed modest
  improvements in blood parameters including platelet count (p = .01) and hemoglobin
  levels (p < .05). In addition, the percentage of quiescent hematopoietic stem cell
  (HSC) (LSK [Lin-Sca+c-Kit+]) was significantly increased (p = .001) by long-term
  treatment with MET alone. The combination of metformin and oxymetholone did not
  result in a significant synergistic effect in any hematopoietic parameter. Gene
  expression analysis of liver tissue from these animals showed that some of the expression
  changes caused by Fancd2 deletion were partially normalized by metformin treatment.
  Importantly, no adverse effects of the individual or combination therapies were
  observed, despite the long-term administration. We conclude that androgen therapy
  is not a contraindication to concurrent metformin administration in clinical trials.
  HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term coadministration of metformin in combination with oxymetholone
  is well tolerated by Fancd2-/- mice. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in mutant
  mice was enhanced by treatment with metformin alone. Metformin treatment caused
  a partial normalization of gene expression in the livers of mutant mice.'
