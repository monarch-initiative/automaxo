input_text: 'Why hematopoietic stem cells fail in Fanconi anemia: Mechanisms and models.
  Fanconi anemia (FA) is generally classified as a DNA repair disorder, conferring
  a genetic predisposition to cancer and prominent bone marrow failure (BMF) in early
  childhood. Corroborative human and murine studies point to a fetal origin of hematopoietic
  stem cell (HSC) attrition under replicative stress. Along with intriguing recent
  insights into non-canonical roles and domain-specific functions of FA proteins,
  these studies have raised the possibility of a DNA repair-independent BMF etiology.
  However, deeper mechanistic insight is critical as current curative options of allogeneic
  stem cell transplantation and emerging gene therapy have limited eligibility, carry
  significant side effects, and involve complex procedures restricted to resource-rich
  environments. To develop rational and broadly accessible therapies for FA patients,
  the field will need more faithful disease models that overcome the scarcity of patient
  samples, leverage technological advances, and adopt investigational clinical trial
  designs tailored for rare diseases.'
