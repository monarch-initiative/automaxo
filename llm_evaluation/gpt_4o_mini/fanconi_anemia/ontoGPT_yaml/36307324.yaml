input_text: '[Management of genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies in
  patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Guidelines
  from the SFGM-TC]. The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify
  genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL)
  more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations
  in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these
  mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family
  history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it
  is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy
  (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management
  of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data,
  with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of
  the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases.
  Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual
  criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure
  that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility
  of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary
  to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information
  on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess
  the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning
  (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the
  risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to
  recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized
  syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In
  summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence
  of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order
  to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard
  to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure,
  such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if
  the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and
  psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family.
  A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists
  and psychologists is essential.'
