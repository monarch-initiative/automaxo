input_text: "Late Effects After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Among Childhood
  Transplant Survivors with Fanconi Anemia. Background: Fanconi anemia is the most
  common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. HSCT remains the only curative treatment
  for hematological manifestations of FA. Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis,
  patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we
  aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients,
  and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines
  for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered,
  cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA
  according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36
  years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation
  (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant.
  Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal
  dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic
  hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated
  for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and
  12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation
  score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two
  (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although,
  none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients
  had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions
  revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive
  changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of
  the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients.
  Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed
  in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary
  approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential
  for early detection and management of late effects."
