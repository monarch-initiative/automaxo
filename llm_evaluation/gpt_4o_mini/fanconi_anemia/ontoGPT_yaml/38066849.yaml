input_text: Management of Fanconi anemia beyond childhood. Fanconi anemia (FA) has
  long been considered a severe inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) disorder of early
  childhood. Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar
  to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA).
  The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline
  genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched
  sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed
  for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients
  achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons
  why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this
  review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations
  for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic
  monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies
  occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ
  dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term
  monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.
