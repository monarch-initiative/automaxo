input_text: 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for inherited bone marrow failure
  syndromes: alternative donor and disease-specific conditioning regimen with unmanipulated
  grafts. Objective: The outcomes of alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) with unmanipulated grafts for Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)
  are discouraging. Our study is to demonstrate that IBMFS with disease-specific characteristics
  requires a tailored conditioning regimens to enhance engraftment and reduce regimen
  related toxicities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with
  IBMFS and transplanted with an alternative donor graft at our center from November
  2012 to August 2018. Twenty-seven patients had Fanconi anemia (FA), 7 had dyskeratosis
  congenita (DC), and 8 had severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients received
  ex-vivo unmanipulated alternative donor grafts from a matched unrelated donor (MUD)
  (n = 22), haploidentical donor (HID) (n = 17) and unrelated cord blood donor (UCBD)
  (n = 3). FA and DC patient subgroups received reduce intensified conditioning (RIC),
  while SCN patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Results:
  The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 38 months (range: 9-63
  months). The failure-free survival (FFS) for entire cohort was 76.1%, and was 72.4%,
  100% and 56.2% for patients with FA, DC and SCN, respectively. There were no primary
  graft failures. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD at day 100 was 48.1%. The cumulative
  incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 3 years was 35.0% and 69.3%, respectively. Conclusion:
  HSCT using alternative donors with unmanipulated grafts and disease-specific conditioning
  regimens for IBMFS patients shows promising survival.'
