input_text: 'Minimal intensity conditioning strategies for bone marrow failure: is
  it time for "preventative" transplants? Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
  can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients
  with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high
  mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening
  cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests
  that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking.
  These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes
  until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS
  is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention
  can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities,
  or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT
  trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including
  Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions
  in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients
  to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also
  indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem
  and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic
  genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens,
  this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?'
