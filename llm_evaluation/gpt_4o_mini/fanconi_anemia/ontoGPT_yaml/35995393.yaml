input_text: Non-genotoxic Restoration of the Hematolymphoid System in Fanconi Anemia.
  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients
  with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens
  contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both
  short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly
  harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting
  in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents.
  mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy
  for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage.
  Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate
  the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic
  stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic
  donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of
  different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and
  depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals
  were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates
  (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo
  experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and
  recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to
  evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical
  analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117
  mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models;
  however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination
  with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion
  and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the
  first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting,
  with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly,
  our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for
  FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression
  alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results
  demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based
  conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient
  immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of
  a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival
  advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning
  strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid
  diseases.
