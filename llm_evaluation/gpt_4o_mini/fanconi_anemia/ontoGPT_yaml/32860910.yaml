input_text: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome after Allogeneic Stem Cell
  Transplantation in Pediatric Patients with Fanconi Anemia, a Prospective Study.
  Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is one of the most common neurologic
  complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed
  to evaluate the incidence, clinical, and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients
  with Fanconi anemia (FA) following HSCT. This prospective study included all post-HSCT
  patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017. Brain computed tomography
  scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in all individuals who
  developed neurologic symptoms. PRES was diagnosed based on clinic-radiological evidence.
  Follow-up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months. Forty-one
  patients with FA (28 males; mean age, 8.19 +- 3.25 years) were enrolled. Out of
  15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms, PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals
  (21.95% of the total cohort). The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in
  patients who had a donor with a 1-locus mismatch (P= .02). Donor relation, stem
  cell source, and graft-versus-host disease grade did not have any significant association
  with the development of PRES. MRI showed asymmetric vasogenic edema in 5 patients,
  an overt infarct in 1 patient, and foci of microhemorrhages in 3 patients, 1 of
  whom developed a hemorrhagic infarct. This patient died shortly, and persistent
  microhemorrhages were noted in the other 2 patients. Our findings demonstrate a
  greater risk of developing PRES after HSCT in patients with FA compared with those
  with other diseases (21.95% versus 1% to 10%), and in contrast to its term, it might
  be irreversible and has adverse effects on HSCT outcomes. The increased vascular
  and endothelial fragility in FA may contribute to the higher frequency of PRES in
  these individuals.
