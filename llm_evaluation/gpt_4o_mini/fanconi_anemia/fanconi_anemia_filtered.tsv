33350561	A case series of medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia.	"Systemic medications categorized as diphenylhydantoin, calcineurin inhibitor and calcium channel blocker may have effects on the oral cavity by modifying the inflammatory and immune response and causing undesired tissue proliferative reactions. Calcineurin inhibitors are medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH. Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation should be ""medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia"". The correct nomenclature related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate scientific communication and improve the treatment."
38066900	"Minimal intensity conditioning strategies for bone marrow failure: is it time for ""preventative"" transplants?"	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?
35202716	Radiation-free reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with in vivo T-cell depletion from matched related and unrelated donors for Fanconi anemia: prognostic factor analysis.	Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare and complex genetic disorder, clinically characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer predisposition. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis after the occurrence of marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality. However, radiation exposure during transplant may increase the risk of later malignancies. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen in FA patients. A total of 122 patients (median age: 8 years, range: 2-18 years) with FA who underwent HSCT between January 2008 and January 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed up to the end of 2020. The preparative regimen included busulfan (0.2 mg/kg/day, days -9 to -6), cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg/day, days -5 to -2), and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze patient survival. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood hematopoietic stem cells were used in 84 (68.9%), 31 (25.4%) and 7 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Donors were matched siblings in 48 (39.3%), matched other relatives in 56 (45.9%), and matched unrelated persons in 18 (14.8%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 24.25 months, graft rejection occurred in only one patient. The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.14% (95% confidence interval: 76.02-89.70) and 82.16% (95% confidence interval: 73.01-88.45), respectively. Of the patient characteristics documented before transplant, the presence of cardiopulmonary, genitourinary tract, central nervous system, and limb malformations significantly affected survival rates. Our results indicate excellent outcomes in patients with FA undergoing HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. It would be desirable to aim at optimizing the outcome of HSCT in FA patients in future studies.
38066849	Management of Fanconi anemia beyond childhood.	Fanconi anemia (FA) has long been considered a severe inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) disorder of early childhood. Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.
38497679	HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes: A retrospective analysis on behalf of EBMT severe aplastic Anemia and pediatric diseases working parties.	Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) represents the main alternative for children with inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (I-BMF) lacking a matched donor. This retrospective study, conducted on behalf of the EBMT SAAWP and PDWP, aims to report the current outcomes of haplo-SCT in I-BMFs, comparing the different in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion approaches. One hundred and sixty-two I-BMF patients who underwent haplo-SCT (median age 7.4 years) have been registered. Fanconi Anemia was the most represented diagnosis (70.1%). Based on different T-cell depletion (TCD) approaches, four categories were identified: (1) TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ -depletion (43.8%); (2) T-repleted with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy, 34.0%); (3) In-vivo T-depletion with ATG/alemtuzumab (14.8%); (4) CD34+ positive selection (7.4%). The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS) and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively. The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001), while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms.
37085779	Pathological evaluation of renal complications in children following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative therapy for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant disorders, such as aplastic anemia, fanconi anemia, and certain immune deficiencies. Post-transplantation kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide spectrum of structural abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis; FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; MCD, minimal change disease), vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or tubulointerstitial (TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury). Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d), nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The main pathologies identified from kidney biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD (n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF, n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or combined with other pathologies. The median follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy and/or severe infection, one child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), six patients (24%) had elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100micromol/l) and nine patients (36%) still had proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates histomorphologic findings from kidney biopsies of pediatric recipients following allo-HSCT. Detailed evaluation of renal biopsy samples is helpful to elucidate the nature of renal insult, and may potentially identify treatable disease processes.
33399731	Outcomes in pediatrics patients diagnosed with bone marrow failure disorders treated in a tertiary care center.	INTRODUCTION: Bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes are rare disorders with an annual incidence of 2-4 cases per million. Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF treated in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF who consulted at Fundacion Valle de Lili, Cali. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed according to Acquired BMF (ABMF) and Inherited BMF (IBMF). The outcomes include treatment, complications, overall survival (OS) in transplant patients, calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: We included 24 patients with BMF, average age 6.5 +- 4 years, and 50% were women. 58% presented IBMF, 9 with Fanconi anemia (FA), 2 dyskeratosis congenita, 2 congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and 1 presented Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 12 patients treated with HSCT had a 5-year OS of 83%. ABMF represented 42%. 6 patients received IST-HSCT, 3 received IST, and 1 received HSCT. The OS of the IST-HSCT group was 86%. Six patients died, four of them related to infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, there was a higher number of cases with IBMF. The OS of patients treated with HSCT is similar to that reported in recent studies. The most frequent cause of death was of infectious origin which has also been previously reported. The treatment esta blished in the patients showed favorable results in a Latin American tertiary care center.
37880411	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with Fanconi anemia: a report of late effects and psychosocial adjustment in life.	
37400941	Cancer in buccal mucosa in patients with Fanconi anemia: Report of six cases.	INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive hereditary disease characterized by bone marrow failure, and the treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients diagnosed with FA are more predisposed to develop oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and this risk increases in transplant patients. The clinical characteristics of the oral manifestations of SCC in this group of patients do not differ from the lesions present in patients without the disease; however, they can be diagnosed in young patients and less common locations, such as, for example, in the buccal mucosa. OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions in patients with FA. Thus, disclosing a series of cases with similar changes may be relevant to improving and refining the multidisciplinary team's clinical view of suspected SCC or oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), providing surveillance and timely management.
39252317	Clinical and genetic features of Fanconi anemia associated with a variant of FANCA gene: Case report and literature review.	RATIONALE: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the genes involved in the DNA damage repair pathway. The FANCA gene is the most commonly pathogenic gene, accounting for more than 60% of all causative genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: The clinical case is a 3-year-old boy showed mild anemia and scattered bleeding spots the size of a needle tip all over his body. DIAGNOSES: Compound heterozygous mutation was identified in the FANCA gene in the FA case: c.1A > T from the father in exon 1; the deletion of chr16: 89857810-89858476 (exon13-14 del) from the mother; finally, the patient was diagnosed as Fanconi anemia. INTERVENTION: After diagnosis, the child received chemotherapy (Ara-C + Flu + Cy + ATG). Then, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and unrelated umbilical cord blood transfusion were performed. OUTCOMES: The child is recovering well and is in regular follow-up. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The discovery of new mutations in the FANCA gene enriches the genetic profile of FA and helps clinicians to further understand this disease and guide genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing FA.
33656536	HLA-haploidentical TCRalphabeta+/CD19+-depleted stem cell transplantation in children and young adults with Fanconi anemia.	We report on the outcome of 24 patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) lacking an HLA matched related or unrelated donor, given an HLA-haploidentical T-cell receptor alphabeta (TCRalphabeta+) and CD19+ cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the context of a prospective, single-center phase 2 trial. Sustained primary engraftment was achieved in 22 (91.6%) of 24 patients, with median time to neutrophil recovery of 12 days (range, 9-15 days) and platelet recovery of 10 days (range, 7-14 days). Cumulative incidences of grade 1 to 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5%-35.5%) and 5.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-33.4%), respectively. The conditioning regimen, which included fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide and, in most patients, single-dose irradiation was well tolerated; no fatal transplant-related toxicity was observed. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 0.3-8.7 years), the overall and event-free survival probabilities were 100% and 86.3% (95% CI, 62.8%-95.4%), respectively (2 graft failures and 1 case of poor graft function were considered as events). The 2 patients who experienced primary graft failure underwent a subsequent successful HSCT from the other parent. This is the first report of FA patients given TCRalphabeta+/CD19+-depleted haplo-HSCT in the context of a prospective trial, and the largest series of T-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT in FA reported to date. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01810120.
40251844	High-Power Laser Treatment for Oral Leukoplakia in Fanconi Anemia: A Case Series Report.	INTRODUCTION: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder with high susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Oral leukoplakia (OL) is frequent in FA patients and lacks a defined treatment. High-power diode lasers (HPDL) offer precise, minimally invasive ablation with favorable healing. This paper reports HPDL use in OL management in FA patients. CASE REPORT: Four FA patients (1742 years) with clinically and histologically confirmed OL underwent HPDL ablation (808 nm, 1.52 W). Lesions were removed with a 0.5 mm safety margin. All cases showed good healing, no recurrences within 1218 months, and minimal discomfort. Two lesions had dysplasia; one patient had prior SCC. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: HPDL showed favorable short-term outcomes for OL in FA patients. Though limited by small sample and follow-up, the approach may delay malignant transformation. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term benefits.
38227075	HLA-haploidentical T-cell receptor alphabetaT/B-cell-depleted stem cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia.	HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) using post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) is an alternative choice when a suitable donors is unavailable. However, PT-CY is difficult in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) due to their high vulnerability to alkylating agents. For FA, we prefer haplo-SCT by T-cell receptor alphabetaT-cell and B-cell depletion (alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT), which can reduce the risks of PT-CY-related complications and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An 11-year-old boy with diagnosed FA (FANCG mutation) and bone marrow failure was to receive alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT from his father (HLA 4/8 allele matched) due to absence of an HLA-matched donors. alphabetaT/B-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (CD34 + cell count, 1.17 x 107/kg; alphabeta + T-cell count, 1.3 x 105/kg) were infused following conditioning consisting of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin (5 mg/kg), rituximab (375 mg/m2), and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (3 Gy). Tacrolimus was used for GVHD prophylaxis until day + 30. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day + 9, and complete chimerism was confirmed on days + 28 and + 96. At 12-month post-SCT, the patient was well without GVHD or any other complications. alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT is a good choice not only for patients unsuitable for PT-CY, but also for all pediatric recipients to reduce SCT-related complications.
39591479	[Application of gene therapy in the treatment of hematological diseases: achievements, and economic and ethical aspects of the topic].	The discovery of the structure of DNA and the mechanisms that regulate gene expression during the first half of the last century established the theoretical and methodological bases for the development of technology that makes it possible to modify a gene or a genome. The clinical application of techniques that modify the expression of a gene is called gene therapy (GT). These techniques include platforms (viral and non-viral) that bring genetic modification systems or healthy genes to the target cells. ClinicalTrial.gov is a repository of clinical trials that incorporates protocols using TG. In this work, a systematic review of the works registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on the use of TG in hematological diseases was carried out. A total of 41 GT-related clinical trials were found most of which were registered in the United States of America (56.1%). On the other hand, 41.46% of the protocols obtained private funding. Of 50% of all pathologies, only diseases of hematological origin of monogenic origin (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Fanconi anemia) received TG. On the other hand, the number of clinical protocols registered by country was positively correlated with economic development, scientific development, investment in health per capita, and quality of life. Finally, there are still many bioethical, social, political, and economic controversies that must be solved.
35781747	Fanconi anemia and haploidentical stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia is a congenital disorder belonging to bone marrow syndromes, with a risk of developing malignancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment in these cases. Here, we aimed to report our clinical experience in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia treated with haploidentical stem cell transplantation and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, an alternative strategy. METHODS: We performed a case report based on clinical records of two patients who signed the informed consent form and were treated at Fundacion Valle del Lili. RESULT: Two pediatric patients, both with reduced-intensity conditioning, prophylaxis for acute graft-versus-host disease with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. They achieved primary neutrophil/platelets engraftment, and 100% chimerism. Had grade I or II graft-versus-host disease resolved? Currently are alive and in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mismatched related donors for haploidentical stem cell transplantation and post-transplant cyclophosphamide might be a promising option, and well-tolerated in pediatric patients. Serial chimerism can be useful during follow-up.
39048762	MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement: The risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation.	PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.
34669643	Successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with haploidentical donors and non-irradiation conditioning in patients with Fanconi anemia.	
36915258	Successful sequential liver and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with Fanconi anemia.	BACKGROUND: In Fanconi anemia bone marrow failure is the major cause of morbidity and mortality and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents the only curative treatment. Liver disease, in terms of elevated liver function tests, as well as benign and malignant liver tumors, occurs especially in case of androgen treatment. We report a unique case of a child with Fanconi anemia with FANCD2 mutation who developed neonatal cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and bone marrow failure. The child successfully underwent sequential liver transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the first 2 years of life. Nineteen months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 30 months after liver transplantation, the patient is clinically well with normal hematopoietic function and excellent liver function. CONCLUSION: This is the first FA patient who successfully received sequential LT and HSCT highlighting that successful sequential transplantation is feasible in Fanconi anemia patients.
34751952	A new step in understanding stem cell mobilization in patients with Fanconi anemia: A bridge to gene therapy.	BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA, via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+ cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION: Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.
33122581	Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Offer Good Outcomes in Pediatric Aplastic Anemia: Experience From Developing World.	Between 2014 and 2020, 31 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent full match allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our center. Of the 31 patients with SAA, 19 had acquired aplastic anemia, 2 had Diamond Blackfan anemia and 10 had Fanconi anemia. Donors were either matched sibling (n=29), related donors (n=2), or unrelated donors (n=3). Peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source in all the cases except 1. Fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning was used in all except for patients with a diagnosis of Diamond Blackfan anemia. All patients except 1 achieved hematologic recovery in the form of neutrophil engraftment at 13 days (range, 9 to 17), whereas platelet engraftment occurred at 14 days (range, 10 to 18). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate +-antithymocyte globulin (horse/rabbit). Acute GvHD developed in 12.9% patients, whereas no patients developed chronic GvHD till the time of last follow-up. The 2-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 93.21+-4.6%. In patients with SAA, allogeneic stem cell transplant using fludarabine-based conditioning regimens are very well tolerated and have excellent outcomes in a full match setting.
38968140	Outcome of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in 813 Pediatric Patients with Fanconi Anemia.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established curative option for Fanconi anemia (FA) associated bone marrow failure (BMF)/aplastic anemia (AA) and hematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective multicenter study on 813 FA children undergoing first HSCT between 2010 and 2018. Median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range, 3.4-4.0). Median age at transplant was 8.8 years (6.5-18.1). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 5 years were 83% (80-86%), 78% (75-81%) and 70% (67-74%) respectively. OS was comparable between matched family donor (MFD, n=441, 88%) and matched unrelated donor (MUD, n=162, 86%) and was superior to that of mismatched family or unrelated donor (MMFD/MMUD, n=144, 72%) and haploidentical donor (HID) (n=66, 70%, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, a transplant indication of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome compared to AA/BMF, use of MMFD/MMUD and HID compared to MFD, Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (FluCy) + other conditioning compared to FluCy independently predicted inferior OS, while alemtuzumab compared to ATG was associated with better OS. Age   10 years was associated with worse EFS and GRFS. Cumulative incidences (CIN) of primary and secondary graft failure were 2% (1-3%) and 3% (2-4%) respectively. CIN of grade II-IV acute GvHD, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD were 23% (20-26%), 12% (10-15%) and 8% (6-10%) respectively. The 5-year CIN of secondary malignancy was 2% (1-3%). These data suggest that HSCT should be offered to Fanconi Anemia patients with AA/BMF at a younger age in the presence of a well-matched donor.
34417960	Post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant squamous cell carcinoma in patients with Fanconi anemia: a dreadful enemy.	INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative option for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and hematological manifestations but it does not prevent solid tumors, especially squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.

40140759	Effective management of pediatric septic shock: a case study utilizing continuous renal replacement therapy with cytosorb and citrate in a leukemic patient with hyper-interleukin (IL)-6-naemia and severe thrombocytopenia.	BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.
32860910	Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Pediatric Patients with Fanconi Anemia, a Prospective Study.	Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is one of the most common neurologic complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical, and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) following HSCT. This prospective study included all post-HSCT patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms. PRES was diagnosed based on clinic-radiological evidence. Follow-up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months. Forty-one patients with FA (28 males; mean age, 8.19 +- 3.25 years) were enrolled. Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms, PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals (21.95% of the total cohort). The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1-locus mismatch (P= .02). Donor relation, stem cell source, and graft-versus-host disease grade did not have any significant association with the development of PRES. MRI showed asymmetric vasogenic edema in 5 patients, an overt infarct in 1 patient, and foci of microhemorrhages in 3 patients, 1 of whom developed a hemorrhagic infarct. This patient died shortly, and persistent microhemorrhages were noted in the other 2 patients. Our findings demonstrate a greater risk of developing PRES after HSCT in patients with FA compared with those with other diseases (21.95% versus 1% to 10%), and in contrast to its term, it might be irreversible and has adverse effects on HSCT outcomes. The increased vascular and endothelial fragility in FA may contribute to the higher frequency of PRES in these individuals.
37773270	T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for the treatment of Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML.	The only curative approach for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT); however, HCT approaches are inconsistent and limited data on outcomes exist. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of thirty patients with FA and MDS/AML who underwent first allogeneic HCT with a T-cell depleted (TCD) graft at our institution. Patients were transplanted on successive protocols with stepwise changes in cytoreduction and GVHD prophylaxis. All but two patients (93%) experienced durable hematopoietic engraftment. With median follow-up of 8.7 years, 5-year OS was 66.8% and DFS 53.8%. No significant differences in survival were found in patients with high-risk prognostic features (age >=20 years, AML diagnosis, alternative donor graft) or when stratified by conditioning regimen. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively. NRM was higher in patients >=20 years at HCT but did not otherwise differ. We herein demonstrate promising outcomes following allogeneic HCT for patients with FA and MDS/AML using TCD grafts, particularly in a cohort of high-risk patients with 50% >=20 years and a majority receiving mismatched grafts. Future prospective studies are needed to compare this approach with other HCT platforms.
38982646	Fanconi Anemia in a 31-Year-Old Patient with Multiple Malignant Tumor Foci, Including Appendiceal Cancer, and Multiple Coexisting Pathologies.	BACKGROUND Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that impairs the function of the bone marrow and predisposes individuals to aplastic anemia. The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic pathology.
34553252	Kidney complications in 107 Fanconi anemia patients submitted to hematopoietic cell transplantation.	Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and multiple systemic malformations, including congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.
36714935	[STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH FANCONI ANEMIA: AN ISRAELI TERTIARY CENTER EXPERIENCE].	INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by increased chromosomal breakage, congenital anomalies, bone marrow failure and an increased tendency to develop malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for bone marrow failure and the hematologic malignancies these patients develop. Given the sensitivity of FA patients to chemotherapy and radiation, as to the clinical symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), HSCT in these patients is challenging. Since the mid-nineties, HSCT for FA patients is performed in our center by using the fludarabine based reduced-intensity protocol. AIMS: To summarize the results of HSCT for patients with FA using a fludarabine based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen at the Hadassah Medical Center. METHODS: This retrospective research is based on the collection and analysis of clinical and laboratory data from the medical records of patients. RESULTS: Since June 1996 up till February 2020, 39 patients with FA underwent 43 HSCTs with a fludarabine based protocol at the Hadassah Medical Center. Four patients required a second transplant due to primary engraftment failure. Nine patients (23%) suffered from acute GvHD, four of them severe. Eight patients (20%) developed chronic GvHD, two with an extensive and debilitating disease. Thirty-three (85%) of the patients survived and six died, five shortly after the transplant, and one twenty years later from malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show high survival rates with low rates of engraftment failure and reasonable rates of GvHD. DISCUSSION: As of today, there is an effective and safe treatment for patients with FA who require HSCT by using a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with high survival rates and few complications.
35624384	Tongue cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence and the clinical outcome of tongue cancer (TC) in patients affected by Fanconi anemia (FA) who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS: Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7 years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long maintained. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Considering the rarity of FA and the frailty of FA patients, this study may add important information for the cancer management of these patients.
36054728	Oral Premalignant and Malignant Lesions in Fanconi Anemia Patients.	OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of data supporting cancer surveillance in pediatric Fanconi Anemia patients. We sought to describe the rates of upper aerodigestive lesions and malignancy in this population to augment current management guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with Fanconi Anemia from a quaternary referral center between 2007-2021 was completed for head and neck cancer risk. RESULTS: One hundred and five FA patients were reviewed. Average age at presentation was 11.3 years old and 90.5% of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A total of 8.6% of patients had leukoplakia or erythroplakia and 3.8% developed malignancy. The standardized incidence ratio of head and neck malignancy was 483.8. Patients presented with leukoplakia and malignancy at an average age of 14.6 and 25.1 years old, respectively. Malignancies were aggressive and marked by recurrence. There were no premalignant or malignant lesions found on flexible laryngoscopy. This series represents the largest longitudinal series of pediatric FA head and neck lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Fanconi Anemia patients should begin screening for head and neck cancer at age 10 or after HSCT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Laryngoscope, 2022.
33781527	Does Mixed Chimerism After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Pediatric Patients With Fanconi Anemia Impact on Outcome?	Fanconi anemia (FA) cells are characterized by genomic instability, which places FA patients at risk for malignancies such as leukemia and oropharyngeal/urogenital cancers. The risk of development of leukemia is theoretically eliminated after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Mixed chimerism (MC) in FA patients might have a unique implication because the persistent existence of FA cells might give rise to a malignant clone. We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study. Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%) had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%) exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade >= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100 group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00). At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range, 19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 95.7% +- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day +100 (95.7% +- 3.0% versus 95.6% +- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up (96.0% +- 2.8% versus 95.4% +- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of this statement.
36125134	Molecular Monitoring of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Fanconi Anemia.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.
36476918	[Clinical Analysis of Salvage Treatment of Glucocorticoid Resistant Graft-Versus-Host Disease with Vedolizumab in Children].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of VDZ (Vedolizumab) in the salvage treatment of glucocorticoid resistance to gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GR-GI GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children. METHODS: The clinical data of 5 patients with refractory GI GVHD who received allo-HSCT in Wuhan Children's Hospital from December 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed with VDZ salvage therapy. RESULTS: Among the 5 children with refractory GI GVHD, there were 1 male and 4 female, including 2 cases of extremely severe aplastic anemia, 1 case of acute myeloid leukemia (M2, high-risk), 1 case of fanconi anemia and 1 case of myelodysplastic syndrome. The median age of transplant recipients was 54.4 (12-164) months. The median treatment time from transplantation to VDZ was 1.4 (0.6-6.8) months. On average, 3.5 (2-5) doses of VDZ were received. After receiving treatment, 2 patients achieved a complete response (CR), 2 patients achieved a very good partial response (VGPR), 1 patient was non-responsive (NR) after a short-term partial response (PR). Compared with that before VDZ treatment, the amount of diarrhea, stool color, blood and traits of the children after medication were effectively improved. The median follow-up time was 9.3 (7.23-12.83) months. No disseminated or severe bacterial/fungal infections occurred during VDZ treatment and follow-up, and 2 children died of leukemia recurrence and pulmonary bronchiolitis obliterans. CONCLUSION: VDZ salvage treatment of refractory GI GVHD in children has obvious short-term efficacy and good safety.
34774576	Ocular Manifestations in Patients with Fanconi Anemia: A Single-Center Experience Including 106 Patients.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of acquired ocular manifestations in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and to describe and correlate the congenital ocular malformations with the genetic subtypes of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional observational study of 106 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of FA who were followed at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Service at the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. Participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation and 84 patients underwent ocular ultrasound examination. This study was conducted between November 2014 and August 2017. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 43 years of age. Microphthalmia was the most common congenital ocular abnormality (95.2%). A decrease in anthropometric measurements was observed, including palpebral fissure length (78/103 patients [76.5%]), microcornea (48/103 patients [46.6%]), and ptosis (31/103 patients [30.1%]). We identified a new ophthalmic condition in 15 patients with FA, that is, epiretinal tissue on the optic disc. The genetic subtype was identified in 78 patients (79.6%), the FA-A subtype was most prevalent (50%). The most common acquired ocular manifestation (non-graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] related) in patients who did not undergo HSCT (n = 44) was limbal neovascularization (13.6%), whereas in patients who underwent HSCT (n = 62), the GVHD-related manifestation was ocular GVHD (51.6%). The most frequent symptom of ocular GVHD was keratoconjunctivitis sicca (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Several ocular manifestations were identified in patients with FA.
33755277	Bone marrow transplant using fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen with in vivo T cell depletion in patients with Fanconi anemia.	FA is the most common cause of inherited BMF syndromes. The only cure for BMF in FA remains HSCT. Due to DNA instability in FA, RIC has been used to decrease immediate and late complications of HSCT. Most FA conditioning regimens in mismatched and unrelated donor transplants rely on TBI, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies. Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.
38066882	Posttransplant complications in patients with marrow failure syndromes: are we improving long-term outcomes?	Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) encompass a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, non-hematologic multisystemic comorbidities, disease defining congenital anomalies, and a susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and in some instances solid tumors. The most common IBMFS include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and telomere biology disorders/ dyskeratosis congenita. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.
33984160	Natural gene therapy by reverse mosaicism leads to improved hematology in Fanconi anemia patients.	"Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by chromosome fragility, bone marrow failure (BMF) and predisposition to cancer. As reverse genetic mosaicism has been described as ""natural gene therapy"" in patients with FA, we sought to evaluate the clinical course of a cohort of FA mosaic patients followed at referral centers in Spain over a 30-year period. This cohort includes patients with a majority of T cells without chromosomal aberrations in the DEB-chromosomal breakage test. Relative to non-mosaic FA patients, we observed a higher proportion of adult patients in the cohort of mosaics, with a later age of hematologic onset and a milder evolution of (BMF). Consequently, the requirement for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was also lower. Additional studies allowed us to identify a sub-cohort of mosaic FA patients in whom the reversion was present in bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells leading to multilineage mosaicism. These multilineage mosaic patients are older, have a lower percentage of aberrant cells, have more stable hematology and none of them developed leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome when compared to non-mosaics. In conclusion, our data indicate that reverse mosaicism is a good prognostic factor in FA and is associated with more favorable long-term clinical outcomes."
37142543	Beyond current treatment of Fanconi Anemia: What do advances in cell and gene-based approaches offer?	Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disorder that mainly affects the bone marrow. This condition causes decreased production of all types of blood cells. FA is caused by a defective repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and to date, mutations in over 20 genes have been linked to the disease. Advances in science and molecular biology have provided new insight between FA gene mutations and the severity of clinical manifestations. Here, we will highlight the current and promising therapeutic options for this rare disease. The current standard treatment for FA patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a treatment associated to exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, immunological complications, plus opportunistic infections from prolonged immune incompetence or increased risk of morbidity. New arising treatments include gene addition therapy, genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, and hematopoietic stem cell generation from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we will also discuss the revolutionary developments in mRNA therapeutics as an opportunity for this disease.
33235157	Care Coordination in a SARS-CoV-2-infected Child With Newly Diagnosed Medulloblastoma and Fanconi Anemia.	COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for a global pandemic that can cause severe infections in children, especially those with comorbid conditions. Here, we report a case of a child with a newly diagnosed medulloblastoma, Fanconi Anemia, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through multidisciplinary care coordination and meticulous planning, we were able to safely initiate this patient's oncology care and implement a long-term model to address the patient's care. This approach could be replicated with any newly diagnosed pediatric patient that requires monitoring for signs of COVID-19 with concurrent oncology care.
37848556	Predictors of outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia.	Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the only cure for the hematologic manifestations of Fanconi anemia (FA). We performed retrospective predictor analyses for HCT outcomes in FA for pediatric and young adult patients transplanted between 2007 and 2020 across three large referral institutions. Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM). In the pediatric group, TCD was a borderline MVP (P = 0.059) with 5-year OS of 73.0% in TCD vs. 100% for T-replete HCT. The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete 3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT. Survival chances after HCT for FA are excellent and associated with high engrafted survival and low toxicity. Age >=19, HLA mismatch, year of transplant and 'TCD in the <19 years group' (although borderline) were found to be negative predictors for survival.
40128086	CYP2B6 genetic variation in cyclophosphamide metabolism and hemorrhagic cystitis in Fanconi anemia patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: A descriptive genetic association study.	Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, and malignancies. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only proven cure for the hematological complications. FA patients have increased chromosomal instability and aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid repair and thus can only tolerate low doses of chemotherapy or radiation as part of conditioning prior to HCT. Yet, they are still prone to severe regimen related toxicities including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) from cyclophosphamide (CY). As CYP2B6 is a primary enzyme responsible for the catalyzation of the prodrug form of CY, understanding the association between CYP2B6 genetic variants and HC in FA patients may predict which patients will be more susceptible to developing HC. A descriptive genetic association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated with HC in patients with FA who underwent HCT between 1999 and 2017. All patients received a CY-based preparative regimen and had pretransplant recipient deoxyribonucleic acid available for genomic analysis. Forty FA pediatric patients were eligible for this analysis. They had received HCT from matched sibling donors (n = 6) or alternative donors (n = 34) for marrow failure (n = 38) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2). The incidence of HC was 32.5% which occurred at a median of 32 days (range 20-180) after HCT. 9 patients had a concomitant viral infection (BK virus, n = 8 both adenovirus and BK virus, n = 1). No genetic variants were significantly associated with HC. The top variants were rs2279343 (g.23060A > G), and rs2279344 (g.23280G > A) in the CYP2B6 gene. The incidence of HC among FA patients with the rs2279343 variant was 42% (CI 22%-62%) compared to 20% (CI 0%-40%) among those without the variant (P = .19). The incidence of HC among patients with the variant in rs2279344 was 40% (CI 22%-58%) compared to 10% (CI 0%-28%) among those without (P = .11). No variants in our analysis were statistically associated with HC. The data suggest that CYP2B6 variants may increase the risk for HC in FA patients who received a CY based preparative therapy but these risk variants must be further evaluated in a larger population.
33303901	Survival and toxicity outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia: a unified multicentric national study from the Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative option for hematological manifestations in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). We report the outcome of 34 patients with FA inside a collaborative multicenter national study based on recommendations of Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON) between 2009 and 2016. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was carried out in all patients, with low dose total body irradiation in unrelated transplants. Disease status before HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF) in 30 patients and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in four. Donors were matched siblings donors (MSD) in 18, matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 15, and one haploidentical donor. All except one patient engrafted. Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11% for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%) died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma. Overall survival (OS) was 73% at 5 years post-transplant, with no differences between MSD and MUD transplants. OS for patients with BMF was 80% while for MDS was 25%. Our data suggest HSCT can cure hematologic manifestations of most FA patients with BMF.
36259220	Two decades of stem cell transplantation in patients with Fanconi anemia: Analysis of factors affecting transplant outcomes.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for the hematological complications of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.
34852115	Nursing diagnosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to Fanconi anemia.	OBJECTIVES: to identify nursing diagnoses in patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, according to the NANDA-I taxonomy. METHODS: exploratory study using a retrospective analysis of 85 records from patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, developed in a specialize transplant center in the South of Brazil. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 73 different diagnoses were found in 9 out of the 13 domains from the NANDA-I taxonomy. From these, 22 were in 50% or more of the patients investigated, and most of them are related to the domain Safety/Protection. CONCLUSIONS: it was possible to identify the nursing diagnosis in the patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, contributing to design a plan for the care of these patients. The same was true for those with other syndromes of chromosomal instability that need to undergo this transplant.
36485157	Modern management of Fanconi anemia.	In this review, we present a clinical case report and discussion to outline the importance of long-term specific Fanconi anemia (FA) monitoring, and we discuss the main aspects of the general management of patients with FA and clinical complications. While several nontransplant treatments are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia); hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored. A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management, that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.
33606297	Haplo-identical or mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation for Fanconi anemia: Results from the Severe Aplastic Anemia Working Party of the EBMT.	Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option for bone marrow failure or hematopoietic malignant diseases for Fanconi anemia (FA) patients. Although results have improved over the last decades, reaching more than 90% survival when a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is available, alternative HCT donors are still less reported. We compared HCT outcomes using HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD; n = 123) or haplo-identical donors (HDs), either using only in vivo T cell depletion (n = 33) or T cells depleted in vivo with some type of graft manipulation ex vivo (n = 59) performed for FA between 2000 and 2018. Overall survival (OS) by 24 months was 62% (53-71%) for MMUD, versus 80% (66-95%) for HDs with only in vivo T cell depletion and 60% (47-73%) for HDs with in vivo and ex vivo T cell depletion (p = .22). Event-free survival (EFS) was better for HD-transplanted FA patients with only in vivo T cell depletion 86% (73-99%) than for those transplanted from a MMUD 58% (48-68%) or those with graft manipulation 56% (42-69%) (p = .046). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41% (MMUD) versus 40% (HDs with no graft manipulation) versus 17% (HDs with T cell depleted graft), (p = .005). No differences were found for the other transplant related outcomes. These data suggest that HDs might be considered as an alternative option for FA patients with better EFS using unmanipulated grafts.
36307324	[Management of genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Guidelines from the SFGM-TC].	The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.
34735020	Fanconi anemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant as risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma: A case report with a 12-year follow-up.	Fanconi anemia is a rare disorder resulting from defects in genes responsible for DNA damage responses. It is characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia, and a predisposition to cancer. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment available for bone marrow failure; however, HSCT increases oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk. Here we report the case of a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia in childhood who was treated with HSCT and later diagnosed with multiple OSCCs during a 12-year follow-up. Despite multiple surgical interventions and radiotherapy regimens, the patient`s health deteriorated. Management of individuals with Fanconi anemia is challenging and must be provided by a multidisciplinary healthcare team to ensure better staging, treatment planning, and coordination.
33736979	Role of gene therapy in Fanconi anemia: A systematic and literature review with future directions.	Gene therapy (GT) has been reported to improve bone marrow function in individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA); however, its clinical application is still in the initial stages. We conducted this systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to assess the long-term safety and clinical outcomes of GT in FA patients. Electronic searches from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were conducted and full texts of articles meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed. Three clinical trials were included, with a total of nine patients and mean age of 10.7 +- 5.7 years. All patients had lentiviral-mediated GT. A 1-year follow-up showed stabilization in blood lineages, without any serious adverse effects from GT. A metaregression analysis could not be conducted, as very little long-term follow-up data of patients was observed, and the median survival rate could not be calculated. Thus, we can conclude that GT seems to be a safe procedure in FA; however, further research needs to be conducted on the longitudinal clinical effects of GT in FA, for a better insight into its potential to become a standard form of treatment.

37934348	Gastric cancer with Fanconi anemia in adolescent and young adult patient diagnosed by comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing.	Recently, the results of gastric cancer treatment have improved; however, its characteristics in adolescents and young adults are not well known. We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.
33491597	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes: alternative donor and disease-specific conditioning regimen with unmanipulated grafts.	Objective: The outcomes of alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with unmanipulated grafts for Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are discouraging. Our study is to demonstrate that IBMFS with disease-specific characteristics requires a tailored conditioning regimens to enhance engraftment and reduce regimen related toxicities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with IBMFS and transplanted with an alternative donor graft at our center from November 2012 to August 2018. Twenty-seven patients had Fanconi anemia (FA), 7 had dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and 8 had severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients received ex-vivo unmanipulated alternative donor grafts from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 22), haploidentical donor (HID) (n = 17) and unrelated cord blood donor (UCBD) (n = 3). FA and DC patient subgroups received reduce intensified conditioning (RIC), while SCN patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Results: The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 38 months (range: 9-63 months). The failure-free survival (FFS) for entire cohort was 76.1%, and was 72.4%, 100% and 56.2% for patients with FA, DC and SCN, respectively. There were no primary graft failures. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD at day 100 was 48.1%. The cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 3 years was 35.0% and 69.3%, respectively. Conclusion: HSCT using alternative donors with unmanipulated grafts and disease-specific conditioning regimens for IBMFS patients shows promising survival.

36891729	Gonadal function in pediatric Fanconi anemia patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant.	Gonadal dysfunction and reduced fertility are clinical manifestations well described in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is difficult to differentiate gonadal dysfunction from the primary disease itself or from HSCT procedures. Therefore, it is important to manage expectations about gonadal failure and infertility for all patients with FA, regardless of HSCT status. We performed a retrospective analysis of 98 pediatric patients with FA who were transplanted between July 1990 to June 2020 to evaluate the incidence of gonadal dysfunction in female and male patients with FA. New onset premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) was diagnosed in a total of 30 (52.6%) patients. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased in patients diagnosed with POI. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels declined in POI patients after HSCT (r2 = 0.21, p = 0.001). Twenty (48.8%) male patients were diagnosed with testicular failure. FSH levels increased after HSCT even in patients without testicular failure (r2=0.17, p=0.005). Inhibin B levels decreased over time after HSCT in patients with testicular failure (r2 = 0.14, p = 0.001). These data indicate brisk decline in already impaired gonadal function in transplanted children with FA.

32949371	Long-term outcome in patients with Fanconi anemia who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective nationwide analysis.	We retrospectively analyzed nationwide records of 163 Fanconi anemia (FA) patients [aplastic anemia (AA), n = 118; myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), n = 30; acute leukemia, n = 15] who underwent first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 1987 and 2015 in Japan. An alternative donor was used in 119 (73%) patients, and 160 (98%) patients received a non-T-cell-depleted graft. With an 8.7-year median follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81%. The 5-year OS was significantly higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%, respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>= 18 years), conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12 were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT. On the basis of the risk factors for HSCT in MDS/leukemia patients and subsequent malignancies, a more effective HSCT approach is required.
36718114	Unrelated Donor Cord Blood Transplantation in Children: Lessons Learned Over 3 Decades.	Four decades ago, Broxmeyer et al. demonstrated that umbilical cord blood (CB) contained hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hypothesized that CB could be used as a source of donor HSC for rescue of myeloablated bone marrow. In 1988, Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor. We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD], treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2: 2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than cell dose in this pediatric cohort.
38919026	Medulloblastoma in children with Fanconi anemia: Association with FA-D1/FA-N, SHH type and poor survival independent of treatment strategies.	BACKGROUND: Outcome of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.
34130602	Mixed chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe aplastic anemia.	A retrospective study on 287 patients with SAA who underwent allo-HSCT between October 2012 and January 2020 was conducted to explore the outcomes, risk factors and treatment options for MC. Among 287 AA patients who excluded Fanconi anemia (FA), Congenital dyskeratosis (DKC), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), etc.112 underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, 91 matched unrelated donor-HSCT and 84 haploidentical-HSCT. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups: group 1: Donor chimerism (DC); group 2: MC without cytopenia; group 3: MC with cytopenia; group 4: secondary graft failure (SGF). Compared with the other three groups, SGF predicted a poor prognosis of SAA (P< 0.001). In addition, SGF was associated with the early (within 3 months after transplantation) presence of MC and the high levels of MC. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen were high-risk factors for MC. Of note, in MC patients with cytopenia (group 3), the effective response rate reached 55% (6/11) following enhanced immunosuppression combined with cellular therapy, while only one of the four was effective who received enhanced immunosuppression alone. SGF was associated with poor prognosis, early presence of MC and increased levels of recipient chimerism. The donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen based MSD-HSCT were risk factors for MC. Cellular therapy could improve the effective response rate of patients with progressive MC.
39513346	Late Effects After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Among Childhood Transplant Survivors with Fanconi Anemia.	Background: Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. HSCT remains the only curative treatment for hematological manifestations of FA. Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis, patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients, and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and 12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.
32835780	Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide in Fanconi Anemia: Improving Outcomes with Improved Supportive Care in India.	Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.
35633493	Recent advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.	Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure with unique phenotypes and predisposition to cancer. Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.

38452872	Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation for Fanconi Anemia with a special focus on late complications: a Study on Behalf of Eurocord and SAAWP-EBMT.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.
36656115	Human Mastadenovirus A Infection in a Child During the Course of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.	Following primary infection, human mastadeno- viruses can persist in various tissues. We report a case of a pediatric patient with Fanconi anemia who had a complicated posttransplant course after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant that was associated with human mastadenovirus infection. Human mastadenovirus reactivation was detected with metagenomic analysis during a 3-month follow- up period; the predominant rate of occurrence of human mastadenoviruses was 1.1% on day 0, 84% on day +15, 90% on day +30, and 42% on day +82. Virus shedding continued up to 3 months after transplant. At 36 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the patient was in good clinical condition with full donor chimerism. Long-term follow-up studies for human mastadenoviruses are needed to determine latency period.
34614507	Graft rejection markers in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant for bone marrow failure.	Graft rejection (GR) is a poorly understood complication of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). GR risk factors are well published, but there are no reliable biomarkers or therapies known. Fever is the most common symptom of GR, but no study has evaluated fever kinetics as a diagnostic marker of GR. The objectives of this study were to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapies for GR after HCT. Chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and complement markers (sC5b-9, C3a, and C5a) were measured in 7 patients with GR and compared with 15 HCT controls. All patients had a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, or genetically undefined chromosomal fragility syndrome. All patients with GR were febrile during GR; therefore, control patients who underwent HCT were matched for diagnosis and early fevers after HCT. Patients withh GR had significantly higher CXCL9, BAFF, and sC5b-9 at the time of fever and GR compared with control patients who underwent HCT at the time of fever. The maximum fever was significantly higher and occurred significantly later in the transplant course in patients with GR compared with febrile HCT controls. These data support the use of CXCL9, BAFF, sC5b-9, and fever kinetics as GR markers. Two patients with GR underwent a second HCT that was complicated by high fevers. Both patients received interferon and complement blockers during their second HCT, and both preserved their graft. These laboratory and clinical findings support larger studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon, complement, and BAFF inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of GR after HCT.
33275667	Special pre- and posttransplant considerations in inherited bone marrow failure and hematopoietic malignancy predisposition syndromes.	Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) have provided insight into the complexity of these diseases. The diseases are heterogeneous and characterized by developmental abnormalities, progressive marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. A correct diagnosis allows for appropriate treatment, genetic counseling, and cancer surveillance. The common IBMFSs are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers curative treatment of the hematologic complications of IBMFS. Because of the systemic nature of these diseases, transplant strategies are modified to decrease immediate and late toxicities. HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors offers excellent survival for young patients in aplasia. Challenges include the treatment of adults with marrow aplasia, presentation with myeloid malignancy regardless of age, and early detection or treatment of cancer. In this article, I will describe our approach and evaluation of patients transplanted with IBMFS and review most frequent complications before and after transplant.
