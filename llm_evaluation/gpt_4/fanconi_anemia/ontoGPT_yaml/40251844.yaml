input_text: 'High-Power Laser Treatment for Oral Leukoplakia in Fanconi Anemia: A
  Case Series Report. INTRODUCTION: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder
  with high susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Oral leukoplakia
  (OL) is frequent in FA patients and lacks a defined treatment. High-power diode
  lasers (HPDL) offer precise, minimally invasive ablation with favorable healing.
  This paper reports HPDL use in OL management in FA patients. CASE REPORT: Four FA
  patients (1742 years) with clinically and histologically confirmed OL underwent
  HPDL ablation (808 nm, 1.52 W). Lesions were removed with a 0.5 mm safety margin.
  All cases showed good healing, no recurrences within 1218 months, and minimal discomfort.
  Two lesions had dysplasia; one patient had prior SCC. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: HPDL
  showed favorable short-term outcomes for OL in FA patients. Though limited by small
  sample and follow-up, the approach may delay malignant transformation. Further studies
  are needed to confirm long-term benefits.'
