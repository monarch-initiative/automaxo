input_text: 'CYP2B6 genetic variation in cyclophosphamide metabolism and hemorrhagic
  cystitis in Fanconi anemia patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation:
  A descriptive genetic association study. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder
  characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, and malignancies.
  Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only proven cure for the hematological
  complications. FA patients have increased chromosomal instability and aberrant deoxyribonucleic
  acid repair and thus can only tolerate low doses of chemotherapy or radiation as
  part of conditioning prior to HCT. Yet, they are still prone to severe regimen related
  toxicities including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) from cyclophosphamide (CY). As CYP2B6
  is a primary enzyme responsible for the catalyzation of the prodrug form of CY,
  understanding the association between CYP2B6 genetic variants and HC in FA patients
  may predict which patients will be more susceptible to developing HC. A descriptive
  genetic association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated
  with HC in patients with FA who underwent HCT between 1999 and 2017. All patients
  received a CY-based preparative regimen and had pretransplant recipient deoxyribonucleic
  acid available for genomic analysis. Forty FA pediatric patients were eligible for
  this analysis. They had received HCT from matched sibling donors (n = 6) or alternative
  donors (n = 34) for marrow failure (n = 38) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2).
  The incidence of HC was 32.5% which occurred at a median of 32 days (range 20-180)
  after HCT. 9 patients had a concomitant viral infection (BK virus, n = 8 both adenovirus
  and BK virus, n = 1). No genetic variants were significantly associated with HC.
  The top variants were rs2279343 (g.23060A > G), and rs2279344 (g.23280G > A) in
  the CYP2B6 gene. The incidence of HC among FA patients with the rs2279343 variant
  was 42% (CI 22%-62%) compared to 20% (CI 0%-40%) among those without the variant
  (P = .19). The incidence of HC among patients with the variant in rs2279344 was
  40% (CI 22%-58%) compared to 10% (CI 0%-28%) among those without (P = .11). No variants
  in our analysis were statistically associated with HC. The data suggest that CYP2B6
  variants may increase the risk for HC in FA patients who received a CY based preparative
  therapy but these risk variants must be further evaluated in a larger population.'
