input_text: "Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing.
  Hereditary anemia has various manifestations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD),
  Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD), and thalassemia.
  The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory
  and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes
  of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective
  gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
  from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo
  or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance
  of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the
  genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell
  and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD.
  Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced
  pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation,
  and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia,
  and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation."
