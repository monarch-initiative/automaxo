input_text: 'Association of variations in the Fanconi anemia complementation group
  and prognosis in Non-small cell lung cancer patients with Platinum-based chemotherapy.
  PURPOSE: To explore the associations between FANC (FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, and
  FANCJ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and prognosis of non-small cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC) patients with platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: According to
  the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping
  and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses
  to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival
  (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE
  rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model:
  P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425). In stratification analyses, Longer
  PFS is found in female, age <= 55 years old and non-smoking patients with FANCE
  rs6907678 TT genotype, and patients with TT genotypes were significantly had longer
  OS in male, age >55 years old, non-smoking, squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV
  stratification. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with FANCE rs6907678
  TT genotype are contributed to better prognosis. FANCE rs6907678 may be used as
  a clinical biomarker for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients with platinum-based
  chemotherapy.'
