input_text: 'Monitoring Procedural Pain and Distress in a Child With Rett Syndrome:
  A Case Report. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whole body vibration training is a viable
  option for children with Rett syndrome; however, the positioning requirements and
  intense vibration may be interpreted as pain. CASE: A 13-year-old girl with a diagnosis
  of Rett syndrome, Stage IV, participated. The Individualized Numeric Rating Scale
  was developed in collaboration with the caregiver and scored by a physical therapist
  and student physical therapists during 16 sessions of whole body vibration training.
  OUTCOMES: The therapist and students reached 100% agreement on the Individualized
  Numeric Rating Scale ratings and successfully provided distractions to prevent pain
  and distress from reaching a level 5 out of 10 for 139 of 144 sessions. CONCLUSION:
  This is the first case in the literature to demonstrate use of the Individualized
  Numeric Rating Scale with a child who is nonverbal during a potentially painful
  physical therapy procedure.'
