input_text: 'Comprehensive Analysis of GABAA-A1R Developmental Alterations in Rett
  Syndrome: Setting the Focus for Therapeutic Targets in the Time Frame of the Disease.
  Rett syndrome, a serious neurodevelopmental disorder, has been associated with an
  altered expression of different synaptic-related proteins and aberrant glutamatergic
  and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission. Despite its severity,
  it lacks a therapeutic option. Through this work we aimed to define the relationship
  between MeCP2 and GABAA.-A1 receptor expression, emphasizing the time dependence
  of such relationship. For this, we analyzed the expression of the ionotropic receptor
  subunit in different MeCP2 gene-dosage and developmental conditions, in cells lines,
  and in primary cultured neurons, as well as in different developmental stages of
  a Rett mouse model. Further, RNAseq and systems biology analysis was performed from
  post-mortem brain biopsies of Rett patients. We observed that the modulation of
  the MeCP2 expression in cellular models (both Neuro2a (N2A) cells and primary neuronal
  cultures) revealed a MeCP2 positive effect on the GABAA.-A1 receptor subunit expression,
  which did not occur in other proteins such as KCC2 (Potassium-chloride channel,
  member 5). In the Mecp2+/- mouse brain, both the KCC2 and GABA subunits expression
  were developmentally regulated, with a decreased expression during the pre-symptomatic
  stage, while the expression was variable in the adult symptomatic mice. Finally,
  the expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-related synaptic proteins
  from the postmortem brain biopsies of two Rett patients was evaluated, specifically
  revealing the GABA A1R subunit overexpression. The identification of the molecular
  changes along with the Rett syndrome prodromic stages strongly endorses the importance
  of time frame when addressing this disease, supporting the need for a neurotransmission-targeted
  early therapeutic intervention.'
