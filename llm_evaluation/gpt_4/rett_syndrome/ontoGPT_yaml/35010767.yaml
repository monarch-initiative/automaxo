input_text: 'Comparing Advanced with Basic Telerehabilitation Technologies for Patients
  with Rett Syndrome-A Pilot Study on Behavioral Parameters. The aim of this study
  is to compare the performances of patients with Rett syndrome that were undergoing
  advanced telerehabilitation (ATR) and patients that were undergoing basic telerehabilitation
  (BTR). It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would
  have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities
  that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls
  and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50;
  IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test
  2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with
  three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced
  telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only
  in some neuropsychological measurements. The results are discussed in the light
  of critical factors of telerehabilitation.'
