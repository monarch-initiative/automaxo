  K, Utine GE. Clinical and molecular evaluation of 16 patients with Rett syndrome.
  Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused
  by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression
  following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on
  major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single
  tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see
  if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype
  correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median
  age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation
  of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age
  at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference
  being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria,
  initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group,
  respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups
  were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence
  of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown
  clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in
  clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria
  revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however,
  further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.'
