input_text: "Neurosurgical gene therapy for central nervous system diseases. Viral
  vector mediated gene therapies for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions
  that require neurosurgical administration continue to expand. We systematically
  reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to
  identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies
  targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated
  studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal,
  intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered
  in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered
  clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies
  that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were
  aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression
  profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in
  active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions
  across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral
  vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency,
  sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal
  muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia,
  Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy,
  and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the
  majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery
  methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal
  delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery
  established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets."
