input_text: 'Dendrimer-conjugated glutaminase inhibitor selectively targets microglial
  glutaminase in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Background: Elevated glutamate production
  and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors
  of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate
  have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors
  have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate
  significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous
  solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge.
  Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model
  of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting
  profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation
  of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features.
  Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide
  (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the
  effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined
  GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype
  after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report
  successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility
  compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed
  in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse.
  Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity
  that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral
  assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in
  mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated
  to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce
  glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader
  implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.'
