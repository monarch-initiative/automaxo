input_text: 'A Phase 1, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Effects of Food and Evening
  Dosing on the Pharmacokinetics of Oral Trofinetide in Healthy Adult Subjects. BACKGROUND
  AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide, a synthetic analog of tripeptide glycine-proline-glutamate,
  is an investigational agent for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental
  disorder with affected individuals requiring lifelong support. Food can affect the
  pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential
  effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated
  the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized
  the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution
  of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A;
  reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45
  years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine
  samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis.
  Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio
  between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time
  curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence
  criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening
  fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which
  was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect
  and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted
  unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant
  changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports
  dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.'
