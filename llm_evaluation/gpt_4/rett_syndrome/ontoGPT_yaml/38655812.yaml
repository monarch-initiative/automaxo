input_text: "Emerging therapies for childhood-onset movement disorders. PURPOSE OF
  REVIEW: We highlight novel and emerging therapies in the treatment of childhood-onset
  movement disorders. We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule
  drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation),
  recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based
  on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine'
  (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small
  molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We
  also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase
  deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring
  optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY:
  Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically
  based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular
  mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by
  increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying
  disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment
  of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges
  in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based
  treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders,
  and a clinical trial readiness framework."
