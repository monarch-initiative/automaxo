input_text: 'Radically truncated MeCP2 rescues Rett syndrome-like neurological defects.
  Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder
  Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic
  reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally,
  MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported
  interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors
  (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin
  remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2
  has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are
  essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense
  mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding
  with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain
  and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single
  dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex,
  by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT
  interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the
  N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically
  near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central
  domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is
  able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient
  mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite
  evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor
  binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may
  therefore have therapeutic utility.'
