input_text: Anti-Semaphorin 4D Rescues Motor, Cognitive, and Respiratory Phenotypes
  in a Rett Syndrome Mouse Model. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused
  by mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene. Abnormal physiological functions
  of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D)
  regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including
  cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration
  of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal
  function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the
  pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett
  syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of
  glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial
  cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons
  while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule
  1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates
  Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic
  and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces
  astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an
  abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D,
  while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates
  these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be
  an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor
  function in Rett syndrome.
