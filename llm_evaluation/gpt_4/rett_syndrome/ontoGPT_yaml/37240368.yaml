input_text: 'Evidence Synthesis of Gene Therapy and Gene Editing from Different Disorders-Implications
  for Individuals with Rett Syndrome: A Systematic Review. This systematic review
  and thematic analysis critically evaluated gene therapy trials in amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis, haemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, leukodystrophies, lysosomal
  storage disorders and retinal dystrophies and extrapolated the key clinical findings
  to individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). The PRISMA guidelines were used to search
  six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify
  the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four
  themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing
  strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future
  areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the
  current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene
  editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied
  to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes
  when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention
  appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent
  symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit
  by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms
  from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients
  would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing
  of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful
  outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches
  also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction
  efficiencies and biodistribution.'
