input_text: A perspective on "cure" for Rett syndrome. The reversal of the Rett syndrome
  disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families
  and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests
  that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to
  patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between
  enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been
  a fragmentation of the "Rett syndrome community" with some groups giving priority
  to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based
  interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support
  for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development
  that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a "cure" for patients with Rett syndrome.
  While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe
  and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels
  of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that
  it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies
  with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should
  not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected
  patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a "cure". Thus,
  interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should
  not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.
