input_text: A Novel Mecp2Y120D Knock-in Model Displays Similar Behavioral Traits But
  Distinct Molecular Features Compared to the Mecp2-Null Mouse Implying Precision
  Medicine for the Treatment of Rett Syndrome. MeCP2 is a fundamental protein associated
  with several neurological disorders, including Rett syndrome. It is considered a
  multifunctional factor with a prominent role in regulating chromatin structure;
  however, a full comprehension of the consequences of its deficiency is still lacking.
  Here, we characterize a novel mouse model of Mecp2 bearing the human mutation Y120D,
  which is localized in the methyl-binding domain. As most models of Mecp2, the Mecp2Y120D
  mouse develops a severe Rett-like phenotype. This mutation alters the interaction
  of the protein with chromatin, but surprisingly, it also impairs its association
  with corepressors independently on the involved interacting domains. These features,
  which become overt mainly in the mature brain, cause a more accessible and transcriptionally
  active chromatin structure; conversely, in the Mecp2-null brain, we find a less
  accessible and transcriptionally inactive chromatin. By demonstrating that different
  MECP2 mutations can produce concordant neurological phenotypes but discordant molecular
  features, we highlight the importance of considering personalized approaches for
  the treatment of Rett syndrome.
