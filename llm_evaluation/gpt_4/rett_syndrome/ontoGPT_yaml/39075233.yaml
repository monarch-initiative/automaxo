input_text: Engineering Toxoplasma gondii secretion systems for intracellular delivery
  of multiple large therapeutic proteins to neurons. Delivering macromolecules across
  biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier limits their application in
  vivo. Previous work has demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that naturally
  travels from the human gut to the central nervous system (CNS), can deliver proteins
  to host cells. Here we engineered T. gondii's endogenous secretion systems, the
  rhoptries and dense granules, to deliver multiple large (>100 kDa) therapeutic proteins
  into neurons via translational fusions to toxofilin and GRA16. We demonstrate delivery
  in cultured cells, brain organoids and in vivo, and probe protein activity using
  imaging, pull-down assays, scRNA-seq and fluorescent reporters. We demonstrate robust
  delivery after intraperitoneal administration in mice and characterize 3D distribution
  throughout the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrate GRA16-mediated brain delivery
  of the MeCP2 protein, a putative therapeutic target for Rett syndrome. By characterizing
  the potential and current limitations of the system, we aim to guide future improvements
  that will be required for broader application.
