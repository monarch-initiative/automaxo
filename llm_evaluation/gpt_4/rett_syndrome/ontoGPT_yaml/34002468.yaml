input_text: Profiling beneficial and potential adverse effects of MeCP2 overexpression
  in a hypomorphic Rett syndrome mouse model. De novo loss-of-function mutations in
  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) lead to the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett
  syndrome (RTT). Despite promising results from strategies aimed at increasing MeCP2
  levels, additional studies exploring how hypomorphic MeCP2 mutations impact the
  therapeutic window are needed. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically
  introducing a wild-type MECP2 transgene in the Mecp2 R133C mouse model of RTT. The
  MECP2 transgene reversed the majority of RTT-like phenotypes exhibited by male and
  female Mecp2 R133C mice. However, three core symptom domains were adversely affected
  in female Mecp2R133C/+ animals; these phenotypes resemble those observed in disease
  contexts of excess MeCP2. Parallel control experiments in Mecp2Null/+ mice linked
  these adverse effects to the hypomorphic R133C mutation. Collectively, these data
  provide evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of genetically overexpressing
  functional MeCP2 in Mecp2 R133C mice and suggest that personalized approaches may
  warrant consideration for the clinical assessment of MeCP2-targeted therapies.
