input_text: "Typical vs. atypical: Combining auditory Gestalt perception and acoustic
  analysis of early vocalisations in Rett syndrome. BACKGROUND: Early speech-language
  development of individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) has been repeatedly characterised
  by a co-occurrence of apparently typical and atypical vocalisations. AIMS: To describe
  specific features of this intermittent character of typical versus atypical early
  RTT-associated vocalisations by combining auditory Gestalt perception and acoustic
  vocalisation analysis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We extracted N = 363 (pre-)linguistic
  vocalisations from home video recordings of an infant later diagnosed with RTT.
  In a listening experiment, all vocalisations were assessed for (a)typicality by
  five experts on early human development. Listeners' auditory concepts of (a)typicality
  were investigated in context of a comprehensive set of acoustic time-, spectral-
  and/or energy-related higher-order features extracted from the vocalisations. OUTCOMES
  AND RESULTS: More than half of the vocalisations were rated as 'atypical' by at
  least one listener. Atypicality was mainly related to the auditory attribute 'timbre',
  and to prosodic, spectral, and voice quality features in the acoustic domain. CONCLUSIONS
  AND IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge gained in our study shall contribute to the generation
  of an objective model of early vocalisation atypicality. Such a model might be used
  for increasing caregivers' and healthcare professionals' sensitivity to identify
  atypical vocalisation patterns, or even for a probabilistic approach to automatically
  detect RTT based on early vocalisations."
