                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Girls and women with Rett Syndrome (RTT) have low levels of daily physical activity and high levels of sedentary time. Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological syndrome that affects mostly females. The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50; IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test 2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only in some neuropsychological measurements. The results are discussed in the light of critical factors of telerehabilitation.",

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene. Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. METHODS: AEPs were recorded to simple 100 Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. RESULTS: Substantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. CONCLUSIONS: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.",

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: RS is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, which causes multiple disabilities and serious impairments in neuromotor and cognitive abilities. Three girls (4, 6, and 7 years), diagnosed stage III RS, participated in 20 months of aquatic exercise, with individually tailored, full body exercises, progressively targeting functional, cardiorespiratory, muscle, and flexibility training. Assessments included resting and exercise heart rates, anthropometric measures, functional, clinical aspects, and psychosocial abilities. CONCLUSIONS: The participants improved functional ability, mood status, relations with family and schoolmates, joint mobility, muscle strength, and endurance during functional activities. Periodic evaluation of exercise heart rates averaged an increase in intensity of 33% above baseline, indicating cardiorespiratory stimulus. This pilot program provides clinical rationale for future studies and clinical interventions for RS children.",

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early speech-language development of individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) has been repeatedly characterised by a co-occurrence of apparently typical and atypical vocalisations. AIMS: To describe specific features of this intermittent character of typical versus atypical early RTT-associated vocalisations by combining auditory Gestalt perception and acoustic vocalisation analysis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We extracted N = 363 (pre-)linguistic vocalisations from home video recordings of an infant later diagnosed with RTT. In a listening experiment, all vocalisations were assessed for (a)typicality by five experts on early human development. Listeners' auditory concepts of (a)typicality were investigated in context of a comprehensive set of acoustic time-, spectral- and/or energy-related higher-order features extracted from the vocalisations. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: More than half of the vocalisations were rated as 'atypical' by at least one listener. Atypicality was mainly related to the auditory attribute 'timbre', and to prosodic, spectral, and voice quality features in the acoustic domain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge gained in our study shall contribute to the generation of an objective model of early vocalisation atypicality. Such a model might be used for increasing caregivers' and healthcare professionals' sensitivity to identify atypical vocalisation patterns, or even for a probabilistic approach to automatically detect RTT based on early vocalisations.",

It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50; IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test 2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only in some neuropsychological measurements. The results are discussed in the light of critical factors of telerehabilitation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide, a synthetic analog of tripeptide glycine-proline-glutamate, is an investigational agent for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with affected individuals requiring lifelong support. Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of speech-language teleinterventions delivered via videoconferencing to users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both Cdkl5-/y and Cdkl5+/- mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. In vivo, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; ex vivo experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in Cdkl5-/y mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways, little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry. We find that CDKL5 loss reduces hippocampal synaptic plasticity and augments feedforward inhibition in the perforant path to the dentate gyrus in vivo in Cdkl5 mutant mice. Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice, as it had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria, initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group, respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however, further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chloroquine (CQ) is an antimalarial drug with a growing number of applications as recently demonstrated in attempts to treat Covid-19. For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apneas.",

The increasing prevalence of GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity, and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities, daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff, thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions: Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming. Improved communication between all parties may increase participation and well-being and provide solutions for handling unpleasant activities and sedentary time.Significance: A more varied range of activities may improve the everyday life for individuals with Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

The present study describes the step wise generation and characterization of macrophages from iPSCs using a defined serum free method amenable to scale up to generate a large batch of pure end stage cryopreservable macrophages expressing CD68, CD33, CD11c, CD11b, CD1a, HLA-DR, CD86, CD64, CD80, CD206, CD169, CD47, HLA-ABC, and CX3CR. The end stage macrophages pre and post cryopreservation retain purity, morphology, responsiveness to stimuli and display robust phagocytic function coming right out of cryopreservation. The same differentiation process was used to generate end stage macrophages from isogenic iPSCs engineered to mimic mutations associated with Parkinson's disease (SNCA A53T), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (GRN2/GRN R493X), and Rett syndrome (MECP2-Knockout). End stage macrophages from isogenic engineered clones displayed differential macrophage-specific purity markers, phagocytic function, and response to specific stimuli. Thus, generating a panel of functional, physiologically relevant iPSC-derived macrophages can potentially facilitate the understanding of neural inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration.",

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. METHODS: AEPs were recorded to simple 100 Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. RESULTS: Substantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. CONCLUSIONS: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.",

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

After gene transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine.

Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain.

                    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene Mecp2 Misexpression of the protein MECP2 is thought to contribute to neuropathology by causing dysregulation of plasticity. Female heterozygous Mecp2 mutants (Mecp2het ) failed to acquire a learned maternal retrieval behavior when exposed to pups, an effect linked to disruption of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV) in the auditory cortex. Nevertheless, how dysregulated PV networks affect the neural activity dynamics that underlie auditory cortical plasticity during early maternal experience is unknown. Here we show that maternal experience in WT adult female mice (WT) triggers suppression of PV auditory responses. We also observe concomitant disinhibition of auditory responses in deep-layer pyramidal neurons that is selective for behaviorally relevant pup vocalizations. These neurons further exhibit sharpened tuning for pup vocalizations following maternal experience. All of these neuronal changes are abolished in Mecp2het , suggesting that they are an essential component of maternal learning. This is further supported by our finding that genetic manipulation of GABAergic networks that restores accurate retrieval behavior in Mecp2het also restores maternal experience-dependent plasticity of PV. Our data are consistent with a growing body of evidence that cortical networks are particularly vulnerable to mutations of Mecp2 in PV neurons. Moreover, our work links, for the first time, impaired in vivo cortical plasticity in awake Mecp2 mutant animals to a natural, ethologically relevant behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that includes language communication problems. Nearly all Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that produces the protein MECP2, which is important for changes in brain connectivity believed to underlie learning. We previously showed that female Mecp2 mutants fail to learn a simple maternal care behavior performed in response to their pups' distress cries. This impairment appeared to critically involve inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex called parvalbumin neurons. Here we record from these neurons before and after maternal experience, and we show that they adapt their response to pup calls during maternal learning in nonmutants, but not in mutants. This adaptation is partially restored by a manipulation that improves learning.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder which affects almost exclusively girls, caused by variants in MECP2 gene. Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused predominantly by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2, encoding transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease, these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective. While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations. We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However, careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",

                    "abstract": "Despite the enormous efforts of the scientific community over the years, effective therapeutics for many (epi)genetic brain disorders remain unidentified. The common and persistent failures to translate preclinical findings into clinical success are partially attributed to the limited efficiency of current disease models. Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels.

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

AIMS: To describe specific features of this intermittent character of typical versus atypical early RTT-associated vocalisations by combining auditory Gestalt perception and acoustic vocalisation analysis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We extracted N = 363 (pre-)linguistic vocalisations from home video recordings of an infant later diagnosed with RTT. In a listening experiment, all vocalisations were assessed for (a)typicality by five experts on early human development. Listeners' auditory concepts of (a)typicality were investigated in context of a comprehensive set of acoustic time-, spectral- and/or energy-related higher-order features extracted from the vocalisations. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: More than half of the vocalisations were rated as 'atypical' by at least one listener. Atypicality was mainly related to the auditory attribute 'timbre', and to prosodic, spectral, and voice quality features in the acoustic domain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge gained in our study shall contribute to the generation of an objective model of early vocalisation atypicality. Such a model might be used for increasing caregivers' and healthcare professionals' sensitivity to identify atypical vocalisation patterns, or even for a probabilistic approach to automatically detect RTT based on early vocalisations.",

For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

We previously showed that forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

Gene therapy for this disease presents inherent hurdles since MECP2 is expressed throughout the brain and its duplication leads to severe neurological conditions as well. Herein, we use the AAV-PHP.eB to deliver an instability-prone Mecp2 (iMecp2) transgene cassette which, increasing RNA destabilization and inefficient protein translation of the viral Mecp2 transgene, limits supraphysiological Mecp2 protein levels. Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated delivery of iMecp2 provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.",

Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities, daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff, thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions: Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming. Improved communication between all parties may increase participation and well-being and provide solutions for handling unpleasant activities and sedentary time.Significance: A more varied range of activities may improve the everyday life for individuals with Rett syndrome.",

AIMS: To describe specific features of this intermittent character of typical versus atypical early RTT-associated vocalisations by combining auditory Gestalt perception and acoustic vocalisation analysis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We extracted N = 363 (pre-)linguistic vocalisations from home video recordings of an infant later diagnosed with RTT. In a listening experiment, all vocalisations were assessed for (a)typicality by five experts on early human development. Listeners' auditory concepts of (a)typicality were investigated in context of a comprehensive set of acoustic time-, spectral- and/or energy-related higher-order features extracted from the vocalisations. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: More than half of the vocalisations were rated as 'atypical' by at least one listener. Atypicality was mainly related to the auditory attribute 'timbre', and to prosodic, spectral, and voice quality features in the acoustic domain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge gained in our study shall contribute to the generation of an objective model of early vocalisation atypicality. Such a model might be used for increasing caregivers' and healthcare professionals' sensitivity to identify atypical vocalisation patterns, or even for a probabilistic approach to automatically detect RTT based on early vocalisations.",

Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic behaviors. Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both Cdkl5-/y and Cdkl5+/- mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. In vivo, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; ex vivo experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in Cdkl5-/y mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways, little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry. We find that CDKL5 loss reduces hippocampal synaptic plasticity and augments feedforward inhibition in the perforant path to the dentate gyrus in vivo in Cdkl5 mutant mice. Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice, as it had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a microswitch intervention on increased choice making, engagement in a targeted sorting activity, and indices of happiness, and decreased stereotypic behaviors for six girls with Rett syndrome. Targeted dependent variables were also assessed at six months post-intervention. Following the intervention study, 90 external raters completed a social validation procedure. Method: An ABABAB experimental sequence was implemented for each participant with a cross-over effect. A social validation assessment involving 90 external raters was carried out. Results: Data emphasized an improved performance for each participants involved (i.e., adaptive responses). Five participants showed a capacity of independent choice. One participant seemed to be closely linked to the position of the container. Social raters favorably endorsed the use of the program since they positively evaluated the use of the technology on all the dimensions investigated. Conclusion: A microswitch intervention may improve choice making and activity engagement for children with Rett syndrome. Further research is needed on the development of more sophisticated forms of individualized technological options to improve opportunities for enhanced engagement and choice-making for individuals with RTT.",

Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

                    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorder Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) causes clinical symptoms similar to Rett syndrome (RTT) patients. However, RTT is caused by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly, we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly, post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or, potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Conventional methods of gene transfer lead to inconsistent transgene expression within cells. This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity. The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401 in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).",

Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse).

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

After gene transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement) of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient 0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise component of the activity continuum.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

                    "abstract": "Nutritional supplements are traditionally employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.",

Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement) of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient 0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise component of the activity continuum.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome, a serious neurodevelopmental disorder, has been associated with an altered expression of different synaptic-related proteins and aberrant glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission. Despite its severity, it lacks a therapeutic option. Through this work we aimed to define the relationship between MeCP2 and GABAA.-A1 receptor expression, emphasizing the time dependence of such relationship. For this, we analyzed the expression of the ionotropic receptor subunit in different MeCP2 gene-dosage and developmental conditions, in cells lines, and in primary cultured neurons, as well as in different developmental stages of a Rett mouse model. Further, RNAseq and systems biology analysis was performed from post-mortem brain biopsies of Rett patients. We observed that the modulation of the MeCP2 expression in cellular models (both Neuro2a (N2A) cells and primary neuronal cultures) revealed a MeCP2 positive effect on the GABAA.-A1 receptor subunit expression, which did not occur in other proteins such as KCC2 (Potassium-chloride channel, member 5). In the Mecp2+/- mouse brain, both the KCC2 and GABA subunits expression were developmentally regulated, with a decreased expression during the pre-symptomatic stage, while the expression was variable in the adult symptomatic mice. Finally, the expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-related synaptic proteins from the postmortem brain biopsies of two Rett patients was evaluated, specifically revealing the GABA A1R subunit overexpression. The identification of the molecular changes along with the Rett syndrome prodromic stages strongly endorses the importance of time frame when addressing this disease, supporting the need for a neurotransmission-targeted early therapeutic intervention.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: The current study aimed to infer neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory processing in children with Rett syndrome (RTT)-rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by MECP2 mutations. We examined two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS: We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1 years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION: ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.",

                    "abstract": "Since neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) influence more than 3% of children worldwide, there has been intense investigation to understand the etiology of disorders and develop treatments. Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease, these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective. While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations. We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However, careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls and women with RTT.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

While genetic and medical aspects have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks.",

Music-based interventions improve social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, and physical skills and reduce seizure frequency in patients with RTT. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which music-based interventions compromise sociability impairments in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice as an experimental RTT model. Male mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice and wild-type mice (24 days old) were randomly divided into control, noise, and music-based intervention groups. Mice were exposed to music or noise for 6 h/day for 3 consecutive weeks. Behavioral patterns, including anxiety, spontaneous exploration, and sociability, were characterized using open-field and three-chamber tests. BDNF, TrkB receptor motif, and FNDC5 expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala were probed using RT-PCR or immunoblotting. mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice showed less locomotion in an open field than wild-type mice. The social novelty rather than the sociability of these animals increased following a music-based intervention, suggesting that music influenced the mecp2-deletion-induced social interaction repression rather than motor deficit. Mechanically, the loss of BDNF signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions, but not in the basal ganglia and amygdala, was compromised following the music-based intervention in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice, whereas TrkB signaling was not significantly changed in either region. FNDC5 expression in the prefrontal cortex region in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice also increased following the music-based intervention. Collective evidence reveals that music-based interventions improve mecp2-loss-induced social dysfunction. BDNF and FNDC5 signaling in the prefrontal cortex region mediates the music-based-intervention promotion of social interactions. This study gives new insight into the mechanisms underlying the improvement of social behaviors in mice suffering from experimental Rett syndrome following a music-based intervention.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

Respiratory morbidity represents a major cause of death in this population. Little is known about the benefit of noninvasive ventilation. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with Rett syndrome who underwent a pneumological evaluation combined with a cardiorespiratory polygraphy and/or a pulse oximetry and capnography from 2012 to 2022. RESULTS: Medical records of 11 patients with Rett syndrome, mean age 13 +- 6 years, were evaluated. Most patients presented with both epilepsy and scoliosis. Five patients showed a pathologic sleep study and/or impaired night gas exchange: mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was 4 +- 3 events/hour; mean and minimal SpO2 were, respectively, 93% +- 2% and 83% +- 6%, while mean and maximal transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring (PtcCO2) were, respectively, 51 +- 5 mm Hg and 55 +- 8 mm Hg; and mean oxygen desaturation index was 13 +- 11 events/hour. These patients started noninvasive ventilation with clinical benefit and improved gas exchange mostly in terms of PtcCO2 (mean PtcCO2 51 +- 5 mm Hg before and 46 +- 6 mm Hg after noninvasive ventilation).

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving.

                    "abstract": "Nutritional supplements are traditionally employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.",

RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene in about 95% of cases and to date no cure is available. The endocannabinoid system modulates several physiological processes and behavioural responses that are impaired in RTT and its deregulation has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders which have symptoms in common with RTT. The present study evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy for RTT of cannabidivarin (CBDV), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid from Cannabis sativa that presents antagonistic properties on the G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the most recently identified cannabinoid receptor. Present results demonstrate that systemic treatment with CBDV (2, 20, 100 mg/Kg ip for 14 days) rescues behavioural and brain alterations in MeCP2-308 male mice, a validated RTT model. The CBDV treatment restored the compromised general health status, the sociability and the brain weight in RTT mice. A partial restoration of motor coordination was also observed. Moreover, increased levels of GPR55 were found in RTT mouse hippocampus, suggesting this G protein-coupled receptor as new potential target for the treatment of this disorder. Present findings highlight for the first time for RTT the translational relevance of CBDV, an innovative therapeutic agent that is under active investigation in the clinical setting.",

METHOD: The caregivers of 435 children (211 females, 224 males; mean age 12y; SD 3y 11mo; age range 5-18y) with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, or Rett syndrome reported on their child's functioning (dependence for managing personal needs, mobility, communication, eye contact when speaking), frequency of participation, and QoL. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between child functioning, participation, and QoL. RESULTS: Children with greater dependency for managing personal needs and limited eye contact when speaking experienced poorer QoL. Less impaired functioning was associated with more frequent participation, which, in turn, was associated with a 3-point gain in QoL for each additional point in frequency of participation (coefficient=2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.78). The effect of impaired functioning on QoL was partially mediated by participation in children with greater dependency in managing personal needs and those with mildly impaired communication. INTERPRETATION: Greater levels of impairments with poorer functioning, notably a high level of dependence, were associated with poorer QoL. Poorer QoL can be partly explained by less frequent community participation.",

The typical group demonstrated the expected pattern of more negative amplitudes within 200-500 ms in response to words than nonwords at left temporal sites. In participants with Rett syndrome, word-nonword differentiation was observed at the right temporal sites. More negative left hemisphere amplitudes in response to words were associated (at trend level) with better receptive language skills and more adaptive behavior. The results indicate that girls with Rett syndrome differentiate known words from novel nonwords, but may do so using potentially atypical neural processes. Brain-behavior correlations support validity of the proposed neural markers of word processing, making passive listening paradigms a promising approach for assessing speech and language processing in participants with limited spoken language skills.",

It is considered a multifunctional factor with a prominent role in regulating chromatin structure; however, a full comprehension of the consequences of its deficiency is still lacking. Here, we characterize a novel mouse model of Mecp2 bearing the human mutation Y120D, which is localized in the methyl-binding domain. As most models of Mecp2, the Mecp2Y120D mouse develops a severe Rett-like phenotype. This mutation alters the interaction of the protein with chromatin, but surprisingly, it also impairs its association with corepressors independently on the involved interacting domains. These features, which become overt mainly in the mature brain, cause a more accessible and transcriptionally active chromatin structure; conversely, in the Mecp2-null brain, we find a less accessible and transcriptionally inactive chromatin. By demonstrating that different MECP2 mutations can produce concordant neurological phenotypes but discordant molecular features, we highlight the importance of considering personalized approaches for the treatment of Rett syndrome.",

Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "Mutations in the MeCP2 gene are responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). MeCP2 is a DNA-binding protein whose abundance and ability to complex with histone deacetylase 3 is linked to the regulation of chromatin structure. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations in MeCP2 are predicted to have broad effects on gene expression. However, to date, studies in mouse models of RTT have identified a limited number of gene or pathway-level disruptions, and even fewer genes have been identified that could be considered amenable to classic drug discovery approaches. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on nine motor cortex and six cerebellar autopsy samples from RTT patients and controls. This approach identified 1887 significantly affected genes in the motor cortex and 2110 genes in the cerebellum, with a global trend toward increased expression. Pathway-level analysis identified enrichment in genes associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, long-term potentiation, and axon guidance. A survey of our RNA-seq results also identified a significant decrease in expression of the CHRM4 gene, which encodes a receptor [muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4)] that is the subject of multiple large drug discovery efforts for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. We confirmed that CHRM4 expression was decreased in RTT patients, and, excitingly, we demonstrated that M4 potentiation normalizes social and cognitive phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice. This work provides an experimental paradigm in which translationally relevant targets can be identified using transcriptomics in RTT autopsy samples, back-modeled in Mecp2+/- mice, and assessed for preclinical efficacy using existing pharmacological tool compounds.",

                    "abstract": "Mutations in the MeCP2 gene are responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). MeCP2 is a DNA-binding protein whose abundance and ability to complex with histone deacetylase 3 is linked to the regulation of chromatin structure. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations in MeCP2 are predicted to have broad effects on gene expression. However, to date, studies in mouse models of RTT have identified a limited number of gene or pathway-level disruptions, and even fewer genes have been identified that could be considered amenable to classic drug discovery approaches. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on nine motor cortex and six cerebellar autopsy samples from RTT patients and controls. This approach identified 1887 significantly affected genes in the motor cortex and 2110 genes in the cerebellum, with a global trend toward increased expression. Pathway-level analysis identified enrichment in genes associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, long-term potentiation, and axon guidance. A survey of our RNA-seq results also identified a significant decrease in expression of the CHRM4 gene, which encodes a receptor [muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4)] that is the subject of multiple large drug discovery efforts for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. We confirmed that CHRM4 expression was decreased in RTT patients, and, excitingly, we demonstrated that M4 potentiation normalizes social and cognitive phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice. This work provides an experimental paradigm in which translationally relevant targets can be identified using transcriptomics in RTT autopsy samples, back-modeled in Mecp2+/- mice, and assessed for preclinical efficacy using existing pharmacological tool compounds.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome, a serious neurodevelopmental disorder, has been associated with an altered expression of different synaptic-related proteins and aberrant glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission. Despite its severity, it lacks a therapeutic option. Through this work we aimed to define the relationship between MeCP2 and GABAA.-A1 receptor expression, emphasizing the time dependence of such relationship. For this, we analyzed the expression of the ionotropic receptor subunit in different MeCP2 gene-dosage and developmental conditions, in cells lines, and in primary cultured neurons, as well as in different developmental stages of a Rett mouse model. Further, RNAseq and systems biology analysis was performed from post-mortem brain biopsies of Rett patients. We observed that the modulation of the MeCP2 expression in cellular models (both Neuro2a (N2A) cells and primary neuronal cultures) revealed a MeCP2 positive effect on the GABAA.-A1 receptor subunit expression, which did not occur in other proteins such as KCC2 (Potassium-chloride channel, member 5). In the Mecp2+/- mouse brain, both the KCC2 and GABA subunits expression were developmentally regulated, with a decreased expression during the pre-symptomatic stage, while the expression was variable in the adult symptomatic mice. Finally, the expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-related synaptic proteins from the postmortem brain biopsies of two Rett patients was evaluated, specifically revealing the GABA A1R subunit overexpression. The identification of the molecular changes along with the Rett syndrome prodromic stages strongly endorses the importance of time frame when addressing this disease, supporting the need for a neurotransmission-targeted early therapeutic intervention.",

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. treatment trends and inpatient outcomes for children undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for Rett syndrome (RTT)-associated scoliosis (RAS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: RTT is a rare, sporadic neurodevelopmental disorder presenting in childhood with developmental regression, ataxia, and seizures. RAS occurs in 50-80% of cases of RTT, but little is known about the case volume and perioperative experience for children undergoing PSF. METHODS: Using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes in the national Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified children with RTT who underwent PSF in 2000-2019. Annual case volumes were analyzed. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with those of a cohort of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS). RESULTS: Among 220 patients with RAS, 216 (98.2%) were female (mean age at surgery 12.3+-3.3 y). Surgical case incidence steadily increased over 19 years, with more RAS admissions in the South (31.4%). Overall, patients with RAS demonstrated a higher mean Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (2 vs. 1, P<0.001) and had more perioperative complications (41.4% vs. 18%, P<0.001) than patients with NMS. RTT diagnosis independently predicted higher odds of any complications (OR 1.98, P<0.001) and increased length of stay (OR 1.18, P=0.009) for admissions for PSF. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for RAS is rare but increased over a 19-year period. Cases appear to be clustering by region, with the highest proportion in the South. The higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index in RAS patients predicted higher cost, longer hospital stay, more complications (particularly respiratory), and more nonroutine discharge disposition than in other NMS patients. RTT was independently associated with higher odds of complications and longer length of stay. Because RAS cases appear to be increasing in number, future study should emphasize methods to reduce morbidity and investigate deformity-specific metrics to help better understand this population.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving.

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI.

Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less.

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: The current study aimed to infer neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory processing in children with Rett syndrome (RTT)-rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by MECP2 mutations. We examined two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS: We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1 years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION: ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the search for objective tools to quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive these measures is \"stationarity\" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. METHODS: AEPs were recorded to simple 100 Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years). We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. RESULTS: Substantially increased ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants, supporting a \"neural unreliability\" account. Application of the DSS technique made it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. CONCLUSIONS: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene. Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "This systematic review and thematic analysis critically evaluated gene therapy trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, haemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders and retinal dystrophies and extrapolated the key clinical findings to individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

While genetic and medical aspects have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",

                    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorder Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) causes clinical symptoms similar to Rett syndrome (RTT) patients. However, RTT is caused by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly, we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly, post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or, potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by severe behavioural and physiological symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene in about 95% of cases and to date no cure is available. The endocannabinoid system modulates several physiological processes and behavioural responses that are impaired in RTT and its deregulation has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders which have symptoms in common with RTT. The present study evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy for RTT of cannabidivarin (CBDV), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid from Cannabis sativa that presents antagonistic properties on the G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the most recently identified cannabinoid receptor. Present results demonstrate that systemic treatment with CBDV (2, 20, 100 mg/Kg ip for 14 days) rescues behavioural and brain alterations in MeCP2-308 male mice, a validated RTT model. The CBDV treatment restored the compromised general health status, the sociability and the brain weight in RTT mice. A partial restoration of motor coordination was also observed. Moreover, increased levels of GPR55 were found in RTT mouse hippocampus, suggesting this G protein-coupled receptor as new potential target for the treatment of this disorder. Present findings highlight for the first time for RTT the translational relevance of CBDV, an innovative therapeutic agent that is under active investigation in the clinical setting.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

This variability can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges, we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated animals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

Additionally, this new vector is highly efficacious at lower doses compared to previous constructs as demonstrated in extensive efficacy studies performed by two independent laboratories in two different Rett syndrome mouse models carrying either a knockout or one of the most frequent human mutations of MeCP2.

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

                    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) include a broad spectrum of disorders that disrupt normal brain development. Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

Immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study, we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes, we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC) effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative stress and immune responses in RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.",

RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene in about 95% of cases and to date no cure is available. The endocannabinoid system modulates several physiological processes and behavioural responses that are impaired in RTT and its deregulation has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders which have symptoms in common with RTT. The present study evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy for RTT of cannabidivarin (CBDV), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid from Cannabis sativa that presents antagonistic properties on the G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the most recently identified cannabinoid receptor. Present results demonstrate that systemic treatment with CBDV (2, 20, 100 mg/Kg ip for 14 days) rescues behavioural and brain alterations in MeCP2-308 male mice, a validated RTT model. The CBDV treatment restored the compromised general health status, the sociability and the brain weight in RTT mice. A partial restoration of motor coordination was also observed. Moreover, increased levels of GPR55 were found in RTT mouse hippocampus, suggesting this G protein-coupled receptor as new potential target for the treatment of this disorder. Present findings highlight for the first time for RTT the translational relevance of CBDV, an innovative therapeutic agent that is under active investigation in the clinical setting.",

Rationally designed EpiEffectors consist of a targeting DNA-binding module (such as a zinc finger protein, TAL effector, or CRISPR/Cas complex) and usually, but not exclusively, a catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression. Moreover, we discuss allele-specific epigenome editing as novel therapeutic approach for imprinting disorders, Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome.",

Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly, or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems, it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments. Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat RTT patients.",

Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly, or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems, it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments. Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat RTT patients.",

METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

Although animal and cellular models have substantially improved our knowledge of the pathological processes involved in these disorders, human brain research has generally been hampered by a lack of satisfactory humanized model systems. This, together with our incomplete knowledge of the multifactorial causes in the majority of these disorders, as well as a thorough understanding of associated (epi)genetic alterations, has been impeding progress in gaining more mechanistic insights from translational studies. Over the last years, however, stem cell technology has been offering an alternative approach to study and treat human brain disorders. Owing to this technology, we are now able to obtain a theoretically inexhaustible source of human neural cells and precursors in vitro that offer a platform for disease modeling and the establishment of therapeutic interventions. In addition to the potential to increase our general understanding of how (epi)genetic alterations contribute to the pathology of brain disorders, stem cells and derivatives allow for high-throughput drugs and toxicity testing, and provide a cell source for transplant therapies in regenerative medicine. In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

                    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X chromosome-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the transcription regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

In the current chapter, we will demonstrate the validity of human stem cell-based models and address the utility of other stem cell-based applications for several human brain disorders with multifactorial and (epi)genetic bases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",

Abnormal physiological functions of glial cells contribute to pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) regulates processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including cytoskeletal structures required for process extension, communication, and migration of glial cells. Blocking SEMA4D-induced gliosis may preserve normal glial and neuronal function and rescue neurological dysfunction in Rett syndrome. We evaluated the pre-clinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody in the Rett syndrome Mecp2T158A transgenic mouse model and investigated the contribution of glial cells as a proposed mechanism of action in treated mice and in primary glial cultures isolated from Mecp2T158A/y mutant mice. SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons while glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive cells are upregulated in Mecp2T158A/y mice. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorates Rett syndrome-specific symptoms and improves behavioural functions in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cohorts of hemizygous Mecp2T158A/y male mice. Anti-SEMA4D also reduces astrocyte and microglia activation in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate an abnormal cytoskeletal structure in mutant astrocytes in the presence of SEMA4D, while anti-SEMA4D antibody treatment blocks SEMA4D-Plexin B1 signaling and mitigates these abnormalities. These results suggest that anti-SEMA4D immunotherapy may be an effective treatment option to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive and motor function in Rett syndrome.",

Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden.

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

                    "abstract": "A considerable fraction of population in the world suffers from rare diseases. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.",

Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly, or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems, it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments. Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat RTT patients.",

Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

The typical group demonstrated the expected pattern of more negative amplitudes within 200-500 ms in response to words than nonwords at left temporal sites. In participants with Rett syndrome, word-nonword differentiation was observed at the right temporal sites. More negative left hemisphere amplitudes in response to words were associated (at trend level) with better receptive language skills and more adaptive behavior. The results indicate that girls with Rett syndrome differentiate known words from novel nonwords, but may do so using potentially atypical neural processes. Brain-behavior correlations support validity of the proposed neural markers of word processing, making passive listening paradigms a promising approach for assessing speech and language processing in participants with limited spoken language skills.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

This disorder mainly affects females, who typically have seemingly normal early development followed by a regression of acquired skills. The rodent Mecp2 model exhibits many of the classic neural abnormalities and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with Rett syndrome. Similar to individuals with Rett syndrome, both auditory discrimination ability and auditory cortical responses are impaired in heterozygous Mecp2 rats. The development of therapies that can enhance plasticity in auditory networks and improve auditory processing has the potential to impact the lives of individuals with Rett syndrome. Evidence suggests that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with sound presentation can drive robust neuroplasticity in auditory networks and enhance the benefits of auditory therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of VNS paired with tones to restore auditory processing in Mecp2 transgenic rats. METHODS: Seventeen female heterozygous Mecp2 rats and 8 female wild-type (WT) littermates were used in this study. The rats were exposed to multiple tone frequencies paired with VNS 300 times per day for 20 days. Auditory cortex responses were then examined following VNS-tone pairing therapy or no therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that Mecp2 mutation alters auditory cortex responses to sounds compared to WT controls. VNS-tone pairing in Mecp2 rats improves the cortical response strength to both tones and speech sounds compared to untreated Mecp2 rats. Additionally, VNS-tone pairing increased the information contained in the neural response that can be used to discriminate between different consonant sounds.

Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement) of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient 0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise component of the activity continuum.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

                    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological syndrome that affects mostly females. The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

The mechanism of DBS benefits has been elusive, however, so we assessed changes in gene expression, splice isoforms, DNA methylation, and proteome following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and mice lacking Mecp2. We found that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function, cell survival, and neurogenesis and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover, DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Results: We found that parents reported favorable impressions of DBS regardless of the target condition, especially when greater improvement could be assured and when their child had the capacity to assist in the treatment decision-making.

Parents were then asked to evaluate each scenario and rate overall acceptability of using DBS to improve their child's core symptoms. Data were collected over a period of 2 weeks in the month of October 2018. Results: We found that parents reported favorable impressions of DBS regardless of the target condition, especially when greater improvement could be assured and when their child had the capacity to assist in the treatment decision-making. Parents indicated some reluctance to use DBS when possible safety concerns were present. Familiarity with DBS was directly associated with attitudes. Conclusions: The findings highlight an overall parental willingness to consider DBS as a treatment option for key symptoms of neurological and psychiatric conditions in adolescents.",

RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival.

The mechanism of DBS benefits has been elusive, however, so we assessed changes in gene expression, splice isoforms, DNA methylation, and proteome following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and mice lacking Mecp2. We found that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function, cell survival, and neurogenesis and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover, DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "Background: The fimbria-fornix is a nerve fiber bundle that connects various structures of the limbic system in the brain and plays a key role in cognition. It has become a major target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat memory impairment in both dementia patients and animal models of neurological diseases. Previously, we have reported the beneficial memory effects of chronic forniceal DBS in mouse models of intellectual disability disorders. In Rett syndrome and CDKL5 deficiency disorder models, DBS strengthens hippocampal synaptic plasticity, reduces dentate inhibitory transmission or increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis that aids memory. However, the underlying neuronal circuitry mechanisms remain unknown. This study we explored the neural network circuits involved in forniceal DBS treatment. Methods: We used acute forniceal DBS-induced expression of c-Fos, an activity-dependent neuronal marker, to map the brain structures functionally connected to the fornix. We also evaluated the mouse behavior of locomotion, anxiety, and fear memory after acute forniceal DBS treatment. Results: Acute forniceal DBS induces robust activation of multiple structures in the limbic system. DBS-induced neuronal activation extends beyond hippocampal formation and includes brain structures not directly innervated by the fornix. Conclusions: Acute forniceal DBS activates multiple limbic structures associated with emotion and memory. The neural circuits revealed here help elucidate the neural network effect and pave the way for further research on the mechanism by which forniceal DBS induces benefits on cognitive impairments.",

Our team designed a new truncated methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) promoter allowing widespread expression of MeCP2 in mice and non-human primates after a single injection into the cerebrospinal fluid without causing overexpression symptoms up to 18 months post injection. Additionally, this new vector is highly efficacious at lower doses compared to previous constructs as demonstrated in extensive efficacy studies performed by two independent laboratories in two different Rett syndrome mouse models carrying either a knockout or one of the most frequent human mutations of MeCP2. Overall, data from this multicenter study highlights the efficacy and safety of this gene therapy construct, making it a promising candidate for first in human studies to treat Rett syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily caused by mutations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease. We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2 HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett patients.",

However, RTT is caused by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly, we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly, post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or, potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression.

These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome. A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2 has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity, we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2 gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.",

We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection, this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects. In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse).

These deleterious effects were not observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011, 5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses, blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO.

The document included a table listing epilepsy syndromes and conditions in which the KD has been particularly beneficial, hoping that physicians would refer children for the KD sooner. PURPOSE: To measure the impact of these 2009 recommendations on referral practice, we compared children initiated on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) 10 years before and after the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, children referred to the KD who met indications increased from the pre- to post-recommendation group, 44 % (112/256) to 69 % (175/255) (p < 0.001), with JHH neurologists specifically referring more frequently (10/112, 9 % to 58/175, 33 %) (p < 0.01). Referrals increased for Glut-1 deficiency (0 % to 2.4 %, p = 0.015), Dravet syndrome (0 % to 6.7 %, p < 0.01), Rett syndrome (0.4 % to 3 %, p = 0.018), and formula-fed only status (16 % to 31 %, p < 0.01). The chances of > 50 % seizure reduction for all children referred improved slightly between decades (56 % to 61 %, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Following the 2009 recommendations, our study shows there was an increase in referrals for children with indications at our center. Referrals from neurologists at our own institution increased the most. Ketogenic diet efficacy improved slightly over time but did not reach significance.",

                    "abstract": "Nutritional supplements are traditionally employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress. In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10 appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP, ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration, (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii) Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced damage in RTT erythrocytes.",

Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

                    "abstract": "This systematic review and thematic analysis critically evaluated gene therapy trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, haemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders and retinal dystrophies and extrapolated the key clinical findings to individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",
