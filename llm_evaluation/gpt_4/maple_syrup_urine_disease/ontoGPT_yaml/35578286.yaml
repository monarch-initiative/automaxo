input_text: 'Intravenous administration of a branched-chain amino-acid-free solution
  in children and adults with acute decompensation of maple syrup urine disease: a
  prospective multicentre observational study. BACKGROUND: Patients with maple syrup
  urine disease (MSUD) experiencing metabolic decompensations have traditionally been
  treated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-free mixture via oral or nasogastric
  administration routes. In some patients, enteral administration is not possible,
  either because the patient presents with vomiting, coma, or refuses nasogastric
  administration, thus intravenous (IV) BCAA-free solution is an appropriate intervention
  for these challenging cases. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
  and safety of managing metabolic decompensations by administering an IV BCAA-free
  solution. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study of data from MSUD
  patients hospitalised for decompensation episodes between 2010 and 2016 at 6 centres
  for rare metabolic diseases in France. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (16 males;
  8 females) experiencing 126 MSUD metabolic decompensation episodes (39 in children;
  87 in adults) were admitted to hospital. At presentation, mean leucine plasma concentration
  was >= 381 micromol/L in 113/126 (89.7%) episodes. Children were treated with continuous
  IV BCAA-free solution at doses of 0.8 to 2.0 g/kg/day, for 4.8 days and adults for
  3.8 days at doses of 0.5 to 2.6 g/kg/day. In the efficacy set of 102 analysable
  episodes leucine concentrations were normalised (to below 381 micromol/L) in 82%
  (n = 18/22) of episodes in children and in 84% (n = 67/80) of episodes in adults.
  Mean time to leucine normalisation was 3.0 days. This was significantly (p < 0.001)
  shorter than the algorithmically predicted time to leucine normalisation with traditional
  BCAA-free mixture. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly longer for children
  than for adults (7.1 days in children vs 5.2 days in adults, p = 0.012). No treatment-related
  adverse events were reported in any patients on IV BCAA-free solution. CONCLUSION:
  The IV BCAA-free solution is safe and effective in normalising leucine concentrations
  during MSUD decompensation episodes in both children and adults, offering a practical
  treatment alternative for those patients who cannot receive BCAA-free mixture via
  oral or nasogastric routes.'
