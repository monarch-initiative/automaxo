input_text: 'Successful living domino liver transplantation in a child with protein
  C deficiency. PC is produced in the liver and inhibits blood coagulation by catalyzing
  active factors V and VIII. PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is
  difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency
  treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for
  PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received
  DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed
  intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents
  had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore,
  she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We
  performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate
  safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities
  and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by
  living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is
  a treatment option for PC deficiency. '
