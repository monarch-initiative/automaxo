input_text: "Successful domino liver transplantation in maple syrup urine disease
  using a related living donor. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive
  disease associated with high levels of branched-chain amino acids. Children with
  MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows
  the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use
  of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes.
  We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT.
  The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft.
  The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed
  after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and
  DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation
  in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory
  carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both
  normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion,
  our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and
  the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine
  donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available,
  and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic
  and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required
  to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. "
