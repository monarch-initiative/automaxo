input_text: 'Living donor liver transplantation from a heterozygous parent for classical
  maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a hereditary metabolic disorder that is characterized
  by impaired activity of the BCKADC. Liver transplantation has been approved as a
  treatment for some MSUD cases in which the control of BCAAs is insufficient. Although
  there have been several reports about DDLT for MSUD, few LDLT cases have been reported.
  Because either of parents who are heterozygote of this disease usually applies to
  be a candidate of donor in LDLT, the impairment of BCKADC activity of graft liver
  should be concerned. We performed LDLT for 10 month-old girl with a left lateral
  segment graft from her father. BCKADC activities of the patient and her parents
  were measured using lysates of lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood specimen
  before the transplant. As a consequence, the activity of BCKADC of father was not
  inferior to a normal range. The patient tolerated the operation well. Postoperative
  course was uneventful and mixed milk was started at 8th POD. The serum BCAAs levels
  have remained within normal range. It should be necessary to follow the physical
  growth and mental development of the recipient in the future. '
