input_text: 'Living donor domino liver transplantation using a maple syrup urine disease
  donor: A case series of three children - The first report from Japan. As the priority
  of LD-Domino LT is the safety of the first recipient, limitations and technical
  difficulties in the second recipient often occur. The most technically challenging
  part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction
  of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because
  longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back
  table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of
  the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence
  of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction
  more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the
  preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case
  series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two
  institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option
  to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second
  recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer
  follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.'
