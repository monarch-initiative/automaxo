input_text: "The impact of liver transplantation on health-related quality of life
  in (acute) intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism. OBJECTIVE: Organic acidurias
  (OAs), urea-cycle disorders (UCDs), and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) belong
  to the category of intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM). Liver
  transplantation (LTx) is increasingly utilized in IT-IEM. However, its impact has
  been mainly focused on clinical outcome measures and rarely on health-related quality
  of life (HRQoL). Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of LTx on HrQoL
  in IT-IEMs. STUDY DESIGN: This single center prospective study involved 32 patients
  (15 OA, 11 UCD, 6 MSUD; median age at LTx 3.0 years, range 0.8-26.0). HRQoL was
  assessed pre/post transplantation by PedsQL-General Module 4.0 and by MetabQoL 1.0,
  a specifically designed tool for IT-IEM. RESULTS: PedsQL highlighted significant
  post-LTx improvements in total and physical functioning in both patients' and parents'
  scores. According to age at transplantation (<=3 vs. >3 years), younger patients
  showed higher post-LTx scores on Physical (p=0.03), Social (p<0.001) and Total (p=0.007)
  functioning. MetabQoL confirmed significant post-LTx changes in Total and Physical
  functioning in both patients and parents scores (p<=0.009). Differently from PedsQL,
  MetabQoL Mental (patients p=0.013, parents p=0.03) and Social scores (patients p=0.02,
  parents p=0.012) were significantly higher post-LTx. Significant improvements (p=0.001-0.04)
  were also detected both in self- and proxy-reports for almost all MetabQoL subscales.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of assessing the impact of transplantation
  on HrQoL, a meaningful outcome reflecting patients' wellbeing. LTx is associated
  with significant improvements of HrQol in both self- and parent-reports. The comparison
  between PedsQL-GM and MetabQoL highlighted that MetabQoL demonstrated higher sensitivity
  in the assessment of disease-specific domains than the generic PedsQL tool. This
