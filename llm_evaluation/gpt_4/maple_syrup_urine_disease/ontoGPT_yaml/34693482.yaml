input_text: 'Characteristics of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration in the acute
  treatment of inherited metabolic disorders. BACKGROUND: Continuous kidney replacement
  therapies (CKRT) have been reported to be an effective approach to removing toxic
  metabolites in inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). The present study evaluates efficiency
  and complications of CKRT in children with IEM. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with
  IEM who underwent CKRT in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units were analyzed.
  CKRT were initiated in patients with persistently high blood ammonia levels (>=
  500 mumol/L), blood ammonia levels > 250 mumol/L in the presence of moderate encephalopathy,
  high blood leucine levels (>= 1500 mumol/L), and blood leucine levels < 1500 mumol/L
  in the presence of deteriorating neurological status or persistent metabolic acidosis.
  RESULTS: Of 22 patients enrolled, nine (40.9%) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD),
  eight (36.4%) urea cycle disorders (UCD), and five (22.7%) organic acidemias (OA).
  Median age was 72.3 [9.9-1040.8] days. In total, 28 dialysis sessions were analyzed
  [16 (57.1%) continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and 12 (42.9%) continuous venovenous
  hemodiafiltration]. A significant decrease was noted in leucine levels (from 1608.4
  +- 885.3 to 314.6 +- 109.9 micromol/L) of patients with MSUD, while ammonia levels
  were significantly decreased in patients with UCD and OA (from 1279.9 +- 612.1 to
  85.1 +- 21.6 micromol/L). The most frequent complications of CKRT were thrombocytopenia
  (60.7%), hypotension (53.6%), and hypocalcemia (42.9%). Median age of patients with
  hypotension treated with vasoactive medications was significantly lower than median
  age of those with normal blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CKRT is a reliable approach
  for effective and rapid removal of toxic metabolites in children with IEM, and CKRT
  modalities can be safely used and are well-tolerated in infants.'
