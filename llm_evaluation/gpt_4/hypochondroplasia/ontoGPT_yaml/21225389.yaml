input_text: Hypochondroplasia due to FGFR3 gene mutation (N540K) and mosaic form of
  Down syndrome in the same patient. The simultaneous presence of Down syndrome and
  achondroplasia has rarely been reported in the literature, and our search revealed
  only six patients with such an association. We are reporting the first case of a
  patient with Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia. In this patient, Down syndrome
  was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype
  (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia
  at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly
  were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of
  fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping
  common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed
  diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect
  on her linear growth. Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations
  (SD) lower than the median height in patients with Down syndrome, and is under the
  lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia.
