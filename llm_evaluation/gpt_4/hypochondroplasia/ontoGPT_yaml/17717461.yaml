input_text: 'Distraction osteogenesis of the lower extremity in patients with achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia
  treated with transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells and platelet-rich
  plasma. BACKGROUND: Longer treatment period in distraction osteogenesis (DO) of
  the lower extremity leads to more frequent complications. We have developed a new
  technique of transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells (BMCs) and platelet-rich
  plasma (PRP) during DO to accelerate new bone formation. To assess the efficacy
  of this cell therapy, retrospective comparative study was conducted between the
  bones treated with BMC and PRP and the bones treated without BMC and PRP during
  DO in patients with achondroplasia (ACH) and hypochondroplasia (HCH). METHODS: Fifty-six
  bones in 20 patients (ACH, 16; HCH, 4) that were lengthened in our hospital were
  divided into 2 groups. Twenty-four bones (femora, 12; tibiae, 12) in 11 patients
  (boys, 7; girls, 4) were treated with BMC and PRP transplantation (BMC-PRP group),
  whereas 32 bones (femora, 14; tibiae, 18) in 9 patients (boys, 3; girls, 6) did
  not undergo additional cell therapy (control group). The parameters, including the
  age at operation, the increase in length, and the healing index, were compared between
  the 2 groups. The clinical outcome was also compared between the femoral and tibial
  lengthenings. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells (average number, +/- SD, 3.2 +/- 1.37 x
  10 cells) and PRP (average platelet concentration +/- SD, 2.36 +/- 0.57 x 10 cells/muL)
  were transplanted. Although there were no significant differences in the age at
  operation and the length gained between the 2 groups, the average healing index
  of the BMC-PRP group (27.1 +/- 6.89 d/cm) was significantly lower than that of the
  control group (36.2 +/- 10.4 d/cm) (P = 0.0005). The femoral lengthening showed
  significantly faster healing than did the tibial lengthening in the BMC-PRP group
  (P = 0.0092). CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of BMC and PRP shortened the treatment
  period by accelerating new bone regeneration during DO of the lower extremity in
  patients with ACH and HCH, especially in the femoral lengthening.'
