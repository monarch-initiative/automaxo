input_text: 'Clinical implications of trials investigating drug-drug interactions
  between cannabidiol and enzyme inducers or inhibitors or common antiseizure drugs.
  Highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety
  profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in randomized,
  double-blind, add-on, controlled phase 3 trials. It is important to consider the
  possibility of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Here, we review six trials of CBD
  (Epidiolex/Epidyolex; 100 mg/mL oral solution) in healthy volunteers or patients
  with epilepsy, which investigated potential interactions between CBD and enzymes
  involved in drug metabolism of common antiseizure drugs (ASDs). CBD did not affect
  CYP3A4 activity. Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 led to small reductions in exposure
  to CBD and its major metabolites. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity did not affect CBD
  exposure and caused small increases in exposure to CBD metabolites. Inhibition of
  CYP2C19 activity led to a small increase in exposure to CBD and small decreases
  in exposure to CBD metabolites. One potentially clinically important DDI was identified:
  combination of CBD and clobazam (CLB) did not affect CBD or CLB exposure, but increased
  exposure to major metabolites of both compounds. Reduction of CLB dose may be considered
  if adverse reactions known to occur with CLB are experienced when it is coadministered
  with CBD. There was a small increase of exposure to stiripentol (STP) when coadministered
  with CBD. STP had no effect on CBD exposure but led to minor decreases in exposure
  to CBD metabolites. Combination of CBD and valproate (VPA) did not cause clinically
  important changes in the pharmacokinetics of either drug, or 2-propyl-4-pentenoic
  acid. Concomitant VPA caused small increases in exposure to CBD metabolites. Dose
  adjustments are not likely to be necessary when CBD is combined with STP or VPA.
  The safety results from these trials were consistent with the known safety profile
  of CBD. These trials indicate an overall low potential for DDIs between CBD and
  other ASDs, except for CLB.'
