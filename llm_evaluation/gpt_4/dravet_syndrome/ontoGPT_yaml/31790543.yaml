input_text: "Fenfluramine for Treatment-Resistant Seizures in Patients With Dravet
  Syndrome Receiving Stiripentol-Inclusive Regimens: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
  Importance: Fenfluramine treatment may reduce monthly convulsive seizure frequency
  in patients with Dravet syndrome who have poor seizure control with their current
  stiripentol-containing antiepileptic drug regimens. Objective: To determine whether
  fenfluramine reduced monthly convulsive seizure frequency relative to placebo in
  patients with Dravet syndrome who were taking stiripentol-inclusive regimens. Design,
  Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
  randomized clinical trial was conducted in multiple centers. Eligible patients were
  children aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome
  who were receiving stable, stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens. Interventions:
  Patients with 6 or more convulsive seizures during the 6-week baseline period were
  randomly assigned to receive fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (maximum, 17 mg/d), or a
  placebo. After titration (3 weeks), patients' assigned dosages were maintained for
  12 additional weeks. Caregivers recorded seizures via a daily electronic diary.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was the change in mean
  monthly convulsive seizure frequency between fenfluramine and placebo during the
  combined titration and maintenance periods relative to baseline. Results: A total
  of 115 eligible patients were identified; of these, 87 patients (mean [SD], age
  9.1 [4.8] years; 50 male patients [57%]; mean baseline frequency of seizures, approximately
  25 convulsive seizures per month) were enrolled and randomized to fenfluramine,
  0.4 mg/kg/d (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Patients treated with fenfluramine achieved
  a 54.0% (95% CI, 35.6%-67.2%; P < .001) greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive
  seizure frequency than those receiving the placebo. With fenfluramine, 54% of patients
  demonstrated a clinically meaningful (>=50%) reduction in monthly convulsive seizure
  frequency vs 5% with placebo (P < .001). The median (range) longest seizure-free
  interval was 22 (3.0-105.0) days with fenfluramine and 13 (1.0-40.0) days with placebo
  (P = .004). The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (19 patients
  taking fenfluramine [44%] vs 5 taking placebo [11%]), fatigue (11 [26%] vs 2 [5%]),
  diarrhea (10 [23%] vs 3 [7%]), and pyrexia (11 [26%] vs 4 [9%]). Cardiac monitoring
  demonstrated no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of valvular heart disease
  or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Conclusions and Relevance: Fenfluramine demonstrated
  significant improvements in monthly convulsive seizure frequency in patients with
  Dravet syndrome whose conditions were insufficiently controlled with stiripentol-inclusive
  antiepileptic drug regimens. Fenfluramine was generally well tolerated. Fenfluramine
  may represent a new treatment option for Dravet syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov
