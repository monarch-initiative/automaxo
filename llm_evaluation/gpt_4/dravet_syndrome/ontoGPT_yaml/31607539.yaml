input_text: dCas9-Based Scn1a Gene Activation Restores Inhibitory Interneuron Excitability
  and Attenuates Seizures in Dravet Syndrome Mice. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe
  epileptic encephalopathy caused mainly by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations
  of the SCN1A gene, indicating haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism. Here
  we tested whether catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)-mediated Scn1a gene activation
  can rescue Scn1a haploinsufficiency in a mouse DS model and restore physiological
  levels of its gene product, the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. We screened
  single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for their ability to stimulate Scn1a transcription in
  association with the dCas9 activation system. We identified a specific sgRNA that
  increases Scn1a gene expression levels in cell lines and primary neurons with high
  specificity. Nav1.1 protein levels were augmented, as was the ability of wild-type
  immature GABAergic interneurons to fire action potentials. A similar enhancement
  of Scn1a transcription was achieved in mature DS interneurons, rescuing their ability
  to fire. To test the therapeutic potential of this approach, we delivered the Scn1a-dCas9
  activation system to DS pups using adeno-associated viruses. Parvalbumin interneurons
  recovered their firing ability, and febrile seizures were significantly attenuated.
  Our results pave the way for exploiting dCas9-based gene activation as an effective
  and targeted approach to DS and other disorders resulting from altered gene dosage.
