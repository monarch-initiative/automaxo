input_text: 'Seizures following vaccination in children: Risks, outcomes and management
  of subsequent revaccination. BACKGROUND: Seizures and status epilepticus can occur
  within 14 days following administration of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines.
  These vaccine-proximate seizures can undermine parental confidence in vaccine safety
  and affect further vaccination decisions. Vaccine-proximate status epilepticus (VP-SE)
  is uncommon but may be the first manifestation of genetic developmental epileptic
  encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article
  is to review current literature on the risks and outcomes of vaccine-proximate seizures
  and, using two clinical scenarios, outline management of subsequent revaccination.
  DISCUSSION: Vaccine-proximate seizures require careful evaluation of the vaccine(s)
  involved, seizure type and duration to determine a safe course for revaccination.
  Vaccine-proximate febrile seizures (VP-FSs) have similar outcomes to other febrile
  seizures and are not associated with increased developmental or behavioural concerns.
  Vaccination for children with VP-FSs can occur safely in the community. However,
  VP-SE cases warrant prompt specialist review, consideration of genetic epilepsy
  testing and referral to a specialist immunisation clinic for subsequent vaccination
  under medical supervision.'
