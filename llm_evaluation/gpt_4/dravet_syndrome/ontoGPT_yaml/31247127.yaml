input_text: 'A multicenter, matched case-control analysis comparing burden-of-illness
  in Dravet syndrome to refractory epilepsy and seizure remission in patients and
  caregivers in Germany. OBJECTIVE: To compare direct and indirect costs and quality
  of life (QoL) of pediatric and adult patients with Dravet syndrome (DS), with drug-resistant
  epilepsy (DRE) and in seizure remission (SR), and their caregivers, in Germany.
  METHODS: Questionnaire responses from 93 DS patients and their caregivers were matched
  by age and gender with responses from 93 DRE and 93 SR patients collected in independent
  studies, and were compared across main components of QoL, direct costs (patient
  visits, medication use, care level, medical equipment, and ancillary treatments),
  and indirect costs (quitting job, reduced working hours, missed days). RESULTS:
  Mean total direct costs were highest for DS patients ($4864 [median $3564] vs $3049
  [median $1506] for DRE [excluding outliers], P = 0.01; and $1007 [median $311],
  P < 0.001 for SR). Total lost productivity over 3 months was highest among caregivers
  of pediatric DS ($4757, median $2841), compared with those of DRE ($1541, P < 0.001;
  median $0) and SR patients ($891, P < 0.001; median $0). The proportions of caregivers
  in employment were similar across groups (62% DS, 63% DRE, and 63% SR) but DS caregivers
  were more likely to experience changes to their working situation, such as quitting
  their job (40% DS vs 16% DRE and 9% SR, P < 0.001 in both comparisons). KINDL scores
  were significantly lower for DS patients (62 vs 74 and 72, P < 0.001 in both comparisons),
  and lower than for the average German population (77). Pediatric caregiver EQ-5D
  scores across all cohorts were comparable with population norms, but more DS caregivers
  experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms (24% vs 11% and 5%). Mean Beck
  Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score was significantly higher in DS caregivers than
  either of the other groups (P < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: This first comparative study
  of Dravet syndrome to difficult-to-treat epilepsy and to epilepsy patients in seizure
  remission emphasizes the excess burden of DS in components of QoL and direct costs.
  The caregivers of DS patients have a greater impairment of their working lives (indirect
  costs) and increased depression symptoms.'
