input_text: 'Changes in pediatric referrals after the 2009 ketogenic diet consensus
  recommendations. BACKGROUND: In 2009, the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group
  published recommendations for children receiving ketogenic diet (KD) therapy for
  epilepsy. The document included a table listing epilepsy syndromes and conditions
  in which the KD has been particularly beneficial, hoping that physicians would refer
  children for the KD sooner. PURPOSE: To measure the impact of these 2009 recommendations
  on referral practice, we compared children initiated on the KD at Johns Hopkins
  Hospital (JHH) 10 years before and after the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall,
  children referred to the KD who met indications increased from the pre- to post-recommendation
  group, 44 % (112/256) to 69 % (175/255) (p < 0.001), with JHH neurologists specifically
  referring more frequently (10/112, 9 % to 58/175, 33 %) (p < 0.01). Referrals increased
  for Glut-1 deficiency (0 % to 2.4 %, p = 0.015), Dravet syndrome (0 % to 6.7 %,
  p < 0.01), Rett syndrome (0.4 % to 3 %, p = 0.018), and formula-fed only status
  (16 % to 31 %, p < 0.01). The chances of > 50 % seizure reduction for all children
  referred improved slightly between decades (56 % to 61 %, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS:
  Following the 2009 recommendations, our study shows there was an increase in referrals
  for children with indications at our center. Referrals from neurologists at our
  own institution increased the most. Ketogenic diet efficacy improved slightly over
  time but did not reach significance.'
