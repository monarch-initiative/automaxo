input_text: Recent Advances in the Drug Treatment of Dravet Syndrome. Dravet syndrome
  is a rare but severe epilepsy syndrome that begins in the first year of life with
  recurrent seizures triggered by fever that are typically prolonged and hemiclonic.
  The epilepsy is highly drug resistant. Although development is normal at onset,
  over time, most patients develop moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, behavior
  disorders, and a characteristic crouch gait. There is a significant mortality, predominantly
  owing to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Complete seizure control is rarely
  attainable. Initial therapy includes valproic acid and clobazam, but response is
  typically inadequate. The results of new drugs for Dravet syndrome, including stiripentol,
  cannabidiol, and fenfluramine, are very promising. Stiripentol was associated with
  a greater than 50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency in 71% of cases, when
  added to valproic acid and clobazam, and also markedly reduced status epilepticus.
  Pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol resulted in a median change in monthly motor seizures
  from baseline of - 36.5%. Fenfluramine was associated with a greater than 50% reduction
  in seizures of 70%, with one quarter of cases achieving near seizure freedom over
  the duration of the trial. These agents are generally well tolerated, with few patients
  discontinuing for adverse effects. There is limited evidence to date regarding improvement
  in cognition with these newer agents; however, a meaningful change is challenging
  to assess over short trial periods and requires longer follow-up studies. While
  current treatments focus predominantly on seizure control, newer therapies including
  genetic treatments and antisense oligonucleotides can target the SCN1A channelopathy,
  and thus, may also significantly impact the important co-morbidities associated
  with this syndrome.
