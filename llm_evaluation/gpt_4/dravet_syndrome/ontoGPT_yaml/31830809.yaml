input_text: Sexually Divergent Mortality and Partial Phenotypic Rescue After Gene
  Therapy in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental
  genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding the alpha subunit
  of the NaV1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel that controls neuronal action potential
  firing. The high density of this mutated channel in GABAergic interneurons results
  in impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and subsequent excessive activation of
  excitatory neurons. The syndrome is associated with severe childhood epilepsy, autistic
  behaviors, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Here, we compared the rescue
  effects of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector coding for the multifunctional
  beta1 sodium channel auxiliary subunit (AAV-NaVbeta1) with a control vector lacking
  a transgene. We hypothesized that overexpression of NaVbeta1 would facilitate the
  function of residual voltage-gated channels and improve the DS phenotype in the
  Scn1a+/- mouse model of DS. AAV-NaVbeta1 was injected into the cerebral spinal fluid
  of neonatal Scn1a+/- mice. In untreated control Scn1a+/- mice, females showed a
  higher degree of mortality than males. Compared with Scn1a+/- control mice, AAV-NaVbeta1-treated
  Scn1a+/- mice displayed increased survival, an outcome that was more pronounced
  in females than males. In contrast, behavioral analysis revealed that male, but
  not female, Scn1a+/- mice displayed motor hyperactivity, and abnormal performance
  on tests of fear and anxiety and learning and memory. Male Scn1a+/- mice treated
  with AAV-NaVbeta1 showed reduced spontaneous seizures and normalization of motor
  activity and performance on the elevated plus maze test. These findings demonstrate
  sex differences in mortality in untreated Scn1a+/- mice, an effect that may be related
  to a lower level of intrinsic inhibitory tone in female mice, and a normalization
  of aberrant behaviors in males after central nervous system administration of AAV-NaVbeta1.
  The therapeutic efficacy of AAV-NaVbeta1 in a mouse model of DS suggests a potential
  new long-lasting biological therapeutic avenue for the treatment of this catastrophic
  epilepsy.
