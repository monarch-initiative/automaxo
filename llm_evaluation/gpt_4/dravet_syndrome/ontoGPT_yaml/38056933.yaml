input_text: Perioperative considerations for adult patients with Dravet syndrome in
  regional centres. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare and intractable severe form of
  epilepsy presenting in infancy with frequent prolonged myoclonic seizures and neurodevelopmental
  impairment, associated with a SCN1A gene mutation. Seizures are often triggered
  by temperature fluctuations and hyperthermia. This report presents a woman in her
  late adolescence with DS complicated with intractable catamenial epilepsy, a sex-specific
  form of epilepsy with seizure activity prominent during phases of the menstrual
  cycle. The patient underwent general anaesthesia for a hysteroscopy, cervical dilatation
  and endometrial curettage with Mirena insertion to improve seizure control. Her
  perioperative care was optimised for seizure prevention with continuation of antiepileptic
  medications, strict temperature monitoring and control, optimised anaesthetic agents
  encompassing induction with propofol and fentanyl with maintenance sevoflurane,
  followed by attentive postoperative care and monitoring. This case demonstrates
  that general anaesthesia can safely be delivered to adult patients with DS in rural
  and regional areas with thorough perioperative planning.
