input_text: 'Abnormal brain gamma oscillations in response to auditory stimulation
  in Dravet syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of children with Dravet
  syndrome to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity in response to auditory steady-state
  stimulation. METHODS: Fifty-one subjects were included: 13 with Dravet syndrome
  with SCN1A gene alterations, 26 with non-Dravet epilepsies and 12 healthy controls.
  Responses to auditory steady-state stimulation elicited with a chirp-modulated tone
  between 1 and 120 Hz were collected in subjects and compared across groups. RESULTS:
  Subjects with Dravet syndrome showed weak or no responses in the 1-120 Hz frequency
  range. Healthy controls showed oscillatory responses following the frequency of
  the modulation that were maximal in the low (30-70 Hz) and high (80-120) gamma-ranges
  both, in the power and inter-trial coherence estimates. Non-Dravet epileptic children
  showed differences in the auditory responses when compared with the healthy controls
  but were able to generate oscillatory evoked activities following the frequency-varying
  stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity
  of children with Dravet in response to a chirp-modulated auditory stimulus is highly
  impaired, is not due to epilepsy and is consistent with the Nav1.1 channel dysfunction
  affecting interneuron activity seen in Dravet mouse models. SIGNIFICANCE: The reported
  deficits in the brain oscillatory activity evoked by chirp modulated tones in children
  with Dravet is compatible with Dravet syndrome disease mechanisms and constitutes
  a potential biomarker for future disease-modifying interventions.'
