input_text: 'Cannabidiol Treatment for Adult Patients with Drug-Resistant Epilepsies:
  A Real-World Study in a Tertiary Center. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Around 30% of patients
  with epilepsy show drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). While cannabidiol has demonstrated
  efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
  (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global
  effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts
  needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy
  unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol
  treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized
  into "authorized" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and "off-label" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness
  and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients
  with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined.
  RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included.
  A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences
  were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and
  retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly
  reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant
  differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more
  prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest
  that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already
  receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients
  to validate these observational findings.'
