29336994	Agreement between the results of meta-analyses from case reports and from clinical studies regarding the efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I who initiated enzyme replacement therapy in adult age: An example of case reports meta-analyses as an useful tool for evidence-based medicine in rare diseases.	BACKGROUND: Case reports might have a prominent role in the rare diseases field, due to the small number of patients affected by one such disease. A previous systematic review regarding the efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) who initiated enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in adult age has been published. The review included a meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies and the description of eleven case reports. It was of interest to perform a meta-analysis of those case reports to explore the role of such meta-analyses as a tool for evidence-based medicine in rare diseases. METHODS: The study included all case reports with standard treatment regimen. Primary analysis was the percentage of case reports showing an improvement in a specific outcome. Only when that percentage was statistically higher than 5%, the improvement was confirmed as such. The outcomes that accomplished this criterion were ranked and compared to the GRADE criteria obtained by those same outcomes in the previous meta-analysis of clinical studies. RESULTS: There were three outcomes that had a significant improvement: Urine glycosaminoglycans, liver volume and 6-minute walking test. Positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity and specificity for the results of the meta-analysis of case reports as compared to that of clinical studies were 100%, 88.9%, 75% and 100%, respectively. Accordingly, absolute (Rho=0.82, 95%CI: 0.47 to 0.95) and relative agreement (Kappa=0.79, 95%CI: 0.593 to 0.99) between the number of case reports with improvement in a specific outcome and the GRADE evidence score for that outcome were good. Sensitivity analysis showed that agreement between the meta-analysis of case reports and that of the clinical studies were good only when using a strong confirmatory strategy for outcome improvement in case reports. CONCLUSIONS: We found an agreement between the results of meta-analyses from case reports and from clinical studies in the efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with MPS-I who initiated ERT in adult age. This agreement suggests that combining case reports quantitatively, rather than analyzing them separately or qualitatively, may improve conclusions in the field of rare diseases.
30259180	Nasal Administration of Cationic Nanoemulsions as Nucleic Acids Delivery Systems Aiming at Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Gene Therapy.	PURPOSE: This study demonstrates the nasal administration (NA) of nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid encoding for IDUA protein (pIDUA) as an attempt to reach the brain aiming at MPS I gene therapy. METHODS: Formulations composed of DOPE, DOTAP, MCT (NE), and DSPE-PEG (NE-PEG) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization, and assessed in vitro on human fibroblasts from MPS I patients and in vivo on MPS I mice for IDUA production and gene expression. RESULTS: The physicochemical results showed that the presence of DSPE-PEG in the formulations led to smaller and more stable droplets even when submitted to dilution in simulated nasal medium (SNM). In vitro assays showed that pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes were internalized by cells, and led to a 5% significant increase in IDUA activity, besides promoting a two-fold increase in IDUA expression. The NA of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes to MPS I mice demonstrated the ability to reach the brain, promoting increased IDUA activity and expression in this tissue, as well as in kidney and spleen tissues after treatment. An increase in serum IL-6 was observed after treatment, although with no signs of tissue inflammatory infiltrate according to histopathology and CD68 assessments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes could efficiently increase IDUA activity in vitro and in vivo after NA, and represent a potential treatment for the neurological impairment present in MPS I patients.
38691622	Early skeletal outcomes after hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell gene therapy for Hurler syndrome.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I Hurler (MPSIH) is characterized by severe and progressive skeletal dysplasia that is not fully addressed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Autologous hematopoietic stem progenitor cell-gene therapy (HSPC-GT) provides superior metabolic correction in patients with MPSIH compared with HSCT; however, its ability to affect skeletal manifestations is unknown. Eight patients with MPSIH (mean age at treatment: 1.9 years) received lentiviral-based HSPC-GT in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT03488394). Clinical (growth, measures of kyphosis and genu velgum), functional (motor function, joint range of motion), and radiological [acetabular index (AI), migration percentage (MP) in hip x-rays and MRIs and spine MRI score] parameters of skeletal dysplasia were evaluated at baseline and multiple time points up to 4 years after treatment. Specific skeletal measures were retrospectively compared with an external cohort of HSCT-treated patients. At a median follow-up of 3.78 years after HSPC-GT, all patients treated with HSPC-GT exhibited longitudinal growth within WHO reference ranges and a median height gain greater than that observed in patients treated with HSCT after 3-year follow-up. Patients receiving HSPC-GT experienced complete and earlier normalization of joint mobility compared with patients treated with HSCT. Mean AI and MP showed progressive decreases after HSPC-GT, suggesting a reduction in acetabular dysplasia. Typical spine alterations measured through a spine MRI score stabilized after HSPC-GT. Clinical, functional, and radiological measures suggested an early beneficial effect of HSPC-GT on MPSIH-typical skeletal features. Longer follow-up is needed to draw definitive conclusions on HSPC-GT's impact on MPSIH skeletal dysplasia.
32330426	Intrastromal Gene Therapy Prevents and Reverses Advanced Corneal Clouding in a Canine Model of Mucopolysaccharidosis I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe phenotypes, including corneal clouding. MPS I is caused by mutations in alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycosaminoglycans. Currently, no treatment exists to address MPS I corneal clouding other than corneal transplantation, which is complicated by a high risk for rejection. Investigation of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) IDUA gene addition strategy targeting the corneal stroma addresses this deficiency. In MPS I canines with early or advanced corneal disease, a single intrastromal AAV8G9-IDUA injection was well tolerated at all administered doses. The eyes with advanced disease demonstrated resolution of corneal clouding as early as 1 week post-injection, followed by sustained corneal transparency until the experimental endpoint of 25 weeks. AAV8G9-IDUA injection in the MPS I canine eye with early corneal disease prevented the development of advanced corneal changes while restoring clarity. Biodistribution studies demonstrated vector genomes in ocular compartments other than the cornea and in some systemic organs; however, a capsid antibody response was detected in only the highest dosed subject. Collectively, the results suggest that intrastromal AAV8G9-IDUA therapy prevents and reverses visual impairment associated with MPS I corneal clouding.
29517765	Long-term outcomes of systemic therapies for Hurler syndrome: an international multicenter comparison.	PURPOSE: Early treatment is critical for mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), justifying its incorporation into newborn screening. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) treats MPS I, yet presumptions that ERT cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) support recommendations that hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) treat the severe, neurodegenerative form (Hurler syndrome). Ethics precludes randomized comparison of ERT with HCT, but insight into this comparison is presented with an international cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome who received long-term ERT from a young age. METHODS: Long-term survival and neurologic outcomes were compared among three groups of patients with Hurler syndrome: 18 treated with ERT monotherapy (ERT group), 54 who underwent HCT (HCT group), and 23 who received no therapy (Untreated). All were followed starting before age 5 years. A sensitivity analysis restricted age of treatment below 3 years. RESULTS: Survival was worse when comparing ERT versus HCT, and Untreated versus ERT. The cumulative incidences of hydrocephalus and cervical spinal cord compression were greater in ERT versus HCT. Findings persisted in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: As newborn screening widens treatment opportunity for Hurler syndrome, this examination of early treatment quantifies some ERT benefit, supports presumptions about BBB impenetrability, and aligns with current guidelines to treat with HCT.
31090850	CASE SERIES OF PATIENTS UNDER BIWEEKLY TREATMENT WITH LARONIDASE: A REPORT OF A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE.	OBJECTIVE: To report the stabilization of urinary glycosaminoglicans (GAG) excretion and clinical improvements in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) under an alternative dose regimen of laronidase of 1.2 mg/kg every other week. METHODS: We participated in a dose-optimization trial for laronidase in MPS-I patients using four alternative regimens: 0.58 mg/kg every week, 1.2 mg/kg every two weeks, 1.2 mg/kg every week and 1.8 mg/kg every other week (EOW). After the trial ended, the patients resumed the recommended dose and regimen of 0.58 mg/kg every week. Under this regimen, some patients presented difficulties in venous access and were unable to commute weekly to the treatment center. Therefore, we used an alternative regimen that consisted of 1.2 mg/kg EOW in eight patients. A retrospective study of medical records of MPS-I patients who underwent both enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) regimens, of 0.58 mg/kg every week and 1.2 mg/kg EOW, was done. RESULTS: Patients remained clinically stable under the alternative regimen, did not present elevation of urinary GAG nor any adverse event.Conclusions: The switch of dose regimen to 1.2 mg/kg EOW of laronidase was safe, and did not cause any clinical worsening in patients who had been previously under standard dose ERT.

30528089	ZFN-Mediated In Vivo Genome Editing Corrects Murine Hurler Syndrome.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a severe disease due to deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) and the subsequent accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAG), leading to progressive, systemic disease and a shortened lifespan. Current treatment options consist of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which carries significant mortality and morbidity risk, and enzyme replacement therapy, which requires lifelong infusions of replacement enzyme; neither provides adequate therapy, even in combination. A novel in vivo genome-editing approach is described in the murine model of Hurler syndrome. A corrective copy of the IDUA gene is inserted at the albumin locus in hepatocytes, leading to sustained enzyme expression, secretion from the liver into circulation, and subsequent uptake systemically at levels sufficient for correction of metabolic disease (GAG substrate accumulation) and prevention of neurobehavioral deficits in MPS I mice. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for this platform-based approach that should be broadly applicable to the treatment of a wide array of monogenic diseases.
27386755	Neonatal tolerance induction enables accurate evaluation of gene therapy for MPS I in a canine model.	High fidelity animal models of human disease are essential for preclinical evaluation of novel gene and protein therapeutics. However, these studies can be complicated by exaggerated immune responses against the human transgene. Here we demonstrate that dogs with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), a model of the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), can be rendered immunologically tolerant to human IDUA through neonatal exposure to the enzyme. Using MPS I dogs tolerized to human IDUA as neonates, we evaluated intrathecal delivery of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector expressing human IDUA as a therapy for the central nervous system manifestations of MPS I. These studies established the efficacy of the human vector in the canine model, and allowed for estimation of the minimum effective dose, providing key information for the design of first-in-human trials. This approach can facilitate evaluation of human therapeutics in relevant animal models, and may also have clinical applications for the prevention of immune responses to gene and protein replacement therapies.
38489810	Natural history of craniovertebral abnormalities in a single-center study in 54 patients with Hurler syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.
26920513	Effect of anti-laronidase antibodies on efficacy and safety of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I: A comprehensive meta-analysis of pooled data from multiple studies.	Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase has an important role in the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Laronidase is safe and has demonstrated effectiveness in terms of stabilizing or improving conventional clinical and laboratory markers of the disease. However, like most ERTs, laronidase produces an anti-drug IgG antibody response in more than 90% of patients during the first few months of treatment. Preclinical data from the MPS I canine model suggest that anti-drug antibodies (ADA) impair enzyme uptake in target tissues. In patients, the effects on tissue glycosaminoglycan (GAG) clearance are difficult to assess directly but data from clinical studies have suggested an association between ADA and both a reduced pharmacodynamic response and hypersensitivity reactions. This comprehensive meta-analysis of pooled data from patients in three clinical studies of laronidase (including one study with an extension) was undertaken to provide a more robust assessment of the relationship between the ADA response to laronidase, clinical and laboratory markers of MPS I, and hypersensitivity reactions. The meta-analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between the ADA response and the percent reduction in urinary GAG (uGAG) levels. However, no relationships between the ADA response and changes in percent predicted forced vital capacity and six-minute walk test were seen. The study also re-assayed stored serum samples from the original trials with a novel method to determine the inhibitory effect of ADA. Patients with higher ADA exposure over time were found to have higher inhibition of enzyme uptake into cells. High ADA exposure can result in a commensurate level of enzyme uptake inhibition that decreases the pharmacodynamic effect of the exogenously administered therapeutic enzyme, but with no clear effect on clinical efficacy. 
35869927	Growth in individuals with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I during untreated and treated periods: Data from the MPS I registry.	Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) is caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Short stature and growth deceleration are common in individuals with the attenuated MPS I phenotype. Study objectives were to assess growth in individuals with attenuated MPS I enrolled in The MPS I Registry while untreated and after initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase (recombinant human iduronidase). Individuals in the MPS I Registry with at least one observation for height and assigned attenuated MPS I phenotype as of September 2020 were included. The cohort included 142 males and 153 females 2-18 years of age. Age and sex adjusted standardized height-for-age z-scores during the natural history and ERT-treatment periods were assessed using linear mixed model repeated measures analyses. Growth curves were estimated during both periods and compared to standard growth charts from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). There was a significantly slower decline in height z-scores with age during the ERT-treated period compared to the natural history period. Estimated average height z-scores in the ERT-treatment versus the natural history period at age 10 were -2.4 versus -3.3 in females and -1.4 versus -2.9 in males (females first treated 3 year; males <4.1 year). While median height remained below CDC standards during both the natural history and ERT-treated periods for individuals with attenuated MPS I, laronidase ERT was associated with slower declines in height z-scores.
30658664	Treatment of thoracolumbar kyphosis in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I: results of an international consensus procedure.	BACKGROUND: In all patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), skeletal disease (dysostosis multiplex) is a prominent, debilitating, condition related complication that may impact strongly on activities of daily living. Unfortunately, it is not alleviated by treatment with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Although early kyphosis is one of the key features of dysostosis multiplex, there is no international consensus on the optimal management. Therefore, an international consensus procedure was organized with the aim to develop the first clinical practice guideline for the management of thoracolumbar kyphosis in MPS I patients. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify all available information about kyphosis and related surgery in MPS I patients. Subsequently, a modified Delphi procedure was used to develop consensus statements. The expert panel included 10 spinal orthopedic surgeons, 6 pediatricians and 3 physiotherapists, all experienced in MPS I. The procedure consisted of 2 written rounds, a face-to-face meeting and a final written round. The first 2 rounds contained case histories, general questions and draft statements. During the face-to-face meeting consensus statements were developed. In the final round, the panel had the opportunity to anonymously express their opinion about the proposed statements. RESULTS: Eighteen case series and case reports were retrieved from literature reporting on different surgical approaches and timing of thoracolumbar kyphosis surgery in MPS I. During the face-to-face meeting 16 statements were discussed and revised. Consensus was reached on all statements. CONCLUSION: This international consensus procedure resulted in the first clinical practice guideline for the management of thoracolumbar kyphosis in MPS I patients, focusing on the goals and timing of surgery, as well as the optimal surgical approach, the utility of bracing and required additional assessments (e.g. radiographs). Most importantly, it was concluded that the decision for surgery depends not only on the kyphotic angle, but also on additional factors such as the progression of the deformity and its flexibility, the presence of symptoms, growth potential and comorbidities. The eventual goal of treatment is the maintenance or improvement of quality of life. Further international collaborative research related to long-term outcome of kyphosis surgery in MPS I is essential as prognostic information is lacking.
31018863	Hurler-Scheie syndrome in Niger: a case series.	BACKGROUND: Hurler-Scheie syndrome is an intermediate form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I which is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency or complete absence of enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase activity. We report the first documented cases of Hurler-Scheie syndrome observed in Niger in a Touareg family. CASE PRESENTATION: We studied the case of two 12-year-old twin Touareg boys and their 10-year-old Touareg sister whose parents are first-degree cousins, and there was no history of similar cases in their previous generations. The diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie syndrome was considered in these patients on the basis of clinical and radiological arguments, with the highlighting of a deficiency of enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase in serum and leukocytes. The twins had presented the first symptoms at the age of 24 months and the diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie syndrome was made at the age of 12 years. In their younger sister, the first symptoms were observed at the age of 3 years and the diagnosis was made at the age of 10 years. The three probands were born after a normal full-term pregnancy and a spontaneous vaginal delivery according to their parents. Their birth weight, height, and head circumference were within normal limits according to their parents. The three probands were brought in for consultation for stunted growth, joint stiffness with gait disorders, deformities of the thoracolumbar spine, recurrent otitis media, decreased hearing, increased abdominal volume, snoring during sleep, and facial dysmorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Even in countries with limited access to diagnostic means, a good knowledge of the clinical manifestations of the disease can help to guide the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis type I.
32278382	A Highly Efficacious PS Gene Editing System Corrects Metabolic and Neurological Complications of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.	Our previous study delivered zinc finger nucleases to treat mice with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), resulting in a phase I/II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02702115). However, in the clinical trial, the efficacy needs to be improved due to the low transgene expression level. To this end, we designed a proprietary system (PS) gene editing approach with CRISPR to insert a promoterless alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) cDNA sequence into the albumin locus of hepatocytes. In this study, adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vectors delivering the PS gene editing system were injected into neonatal and adult MPS I mice. IDUA enzyme activity in the brain significantly increased, while storage levels were normalized. Neurobehavioral tests showed that treated mice had better memory and learning ability. Also, histological analysis showed efficacy reflected by the absence of foam cells in the liver and vacuolation in neuronal cells. No vector-associated toxicity or increased tumorigenesis risk was observed. Moreover, no off-target effects were detected through the unbiased genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) analysis. In summary, these results showed the safety and efficacy of the PS in treating MPS I and paved the way for clinical studies. Additionally, as a therapeutic platform, the PS has the potential to treat other lysosomal diseases.
28619065	Open issues in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler.	Mucopolysaccharidosis I-Hurler (MPS I-H) is the most severe form of a metabolic genetic disease caused by mutations of IDUA gene encoding the lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme. MPS I-H is a rare, life-threatening disease, evolving in multisystem morbidity including progressive neurological disease, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity and cardiomyopathy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the gold standard for the treatment of MPS I-H in patients diagnosed and treated before 2-2.5 years of age, having a high rate of success. Beyond the child's age, other factors influence the probability of treatment success, including the selection of patients, of graft source and the donor type employed. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with human recombinant laronidase has also been demonstrated to be effective in ameliorating the clinical conditions of pre-transplant MPS I-H patients and in improving HSCT outcome, by peri-transplant co-administration. Nevertheless the long-term clinical outcome even after successful HSCT varies considerably, with a persisting residual disease burden. Other strategies must then be considered to improve the outcome of these patients: one is to pursue early pre-symptomatic diagnosis through newborn screening and another one is the identification of novel treatments. In this perspective, even though newborn screening can be envisaged as a future attractive perspective, presently the best path to be pursued embraces an improved awareness of signs and symptoms of the disorder by primary care providers and pediatricians, in order for the patients' timely referral to a qualified reference center. Furthermore, sensitive new biochemical markers must be identified to better define the clinical severity of the disease at birth, to support clinical judgement during the follow-up and to compare the effects of the different therapies. A prolonged neuropsychological follow-up of post-transplant cognitive development of children and residual disease burden is needed. In this perspective, the reference center must guarantee a multidisciplinary follow-up with an expert team. Diagnostic and interventional protocols of reference centers should be standardized whenever possible to allow comparison of clinical data and evaluation of results. This review will focus on all these critical issues related to the management of MPS I-H.
38582963	TALEN-mediated intron editing of HSPCs enables transgene expression restricted to the myeloid lineage.	Gene therapy in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) shows great potential for the treatment of inborn metabolic diseases. Typical HSPC gene therapy approaches rely on constitutive promoters to express a therapeutic transgene, which is associated with multiple disadvantages. Here, we propose a novel promoter-less intronic gene editing approach that triggers transgene expression only after cellular differentiation into the myeloid lineage. We integrated a splicing-competent eGFP cassette into the first intron of CD11b and observed expression of eGFP in the myeloid lineage but minimal to no expression in HSPCs or differentiated non-myeloid lineages. In vivo, edited HSPCs successfully engrafted in immunodeficient mice and displayed transgene expression in the myeloid compartment of multiple tissues. Using the same approach, we expressed alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), the defective enzyme in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and observed a 10-fold supraendogenous IDUA expression exclusively after myeloid differentiation. Edited cells efficiently populated bone marrow, blood, and spleen of immunodeficient mice, and retained the capacity to secrete IDUA ex vivo. Importantly, cells edited with the eGFP and IDUA transgenes were also found in the brain. This approach may unlock new therapeutic strategies for inborn metabolic and neurological diseases that require the delivery of therapeutics in brain.
28882767	Optimization of alginate microcapsules containing cells overexpressing alpha-l-iduronidase using Box-Behnken design.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), which results in the lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) leading to widespread clinical manifestations. The microencapsulation of IDUA overexpressing recombinant cells has been considered as a promising strategy for the treatment of MPS I. This study aimed at the optimization of alginate microcapsules containing recombinant BHK (Baby Hamster Kidney) cells (rBHK) overexpressing IDUA produced by electrostatic extrusion technique. The alginate microcapsule (MC-A) optimization study was carried out by means of an experimental Box-Behnken Design that allowed the simultaneous evaluation of the influence of voltage (kV), alginate/cell suspension flow (mL/h), and alginate concentration (%) on size and IDUA activity. The optimal conditions of voltage (10kV), flow (25mL/h), and alginate concentration (1.3%) made possible to obtain the smallest microcapsules showing the highest IDUA activity. After optimization, the microcapsules were sequentially coated with PLL and alginate (MC-APA) to increase their stability. MC-A and MC-APA presented monodisperse populations (span<1.22) with an average diameter of less than 350mum. The coating increased the mechanical stability of MC-APA by about 6-fold and modulated the permeability to the enzyme. Surface analyzes of MC-APA showed the presence of PLL bands, suggesting that the last alginate layer appears to have only partially coated the PLL. After 30days of subcutaneous implantation of the MC-APA microcapsules containing rBHK cells in a MPS I murine model, a significant increase in IDUA activity was observed in the skin near the implant. Histological analysis revealed an inflammatory infiltrate at the application site, which did not prevent the release of the enzyme under the conditions evaluated. Taken together, the overall results demonstrate the feasibility of MC-APA as a potential alternative for local treatment of MPS I.
31020996	Limited data to evaluate real-world effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are often authorized based on pivotal phase II and III trials that do not always meet high quality criteria. Laronidase is an example of an OMP used for treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). One randomized controlled trial demonstrated efficacy on several somatic symptoms. However, effectiveness in the real-world setting remains to be determined. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on clinically relevant outcomes in MPS I. A search in OVID MEDLINE and OVID EMBASE was performed. Postmarketing studies including MPS I patients treated with ERT and reporting data on any of 19 predefined clinical outcome measures obtained before the start of ERT and at follow-up were eligible. Three scenarios were used to define effectiveness of ERT. The first scenario (A) assumes that improvement is essential, while the second scenario (B) also includes stabilization of signs and symptoms. The third scenario (C) defines failure of therapy. Twenty case series were included. The criteria indicating effectiveness (A), were met for four of 19 outcome measures while the criteria, indicating unclear effectiveness (B) were met for five of 19. For one of 19 nonverifiable data were reported and for nine of 19 no overall conclusions could be drawn (ambiguous results). Real-world effectiveness of laronidase is extremely difficult to assess, 15 years after marketing authorization. This is partially due to insufficient natural history data. We recommend the conduct of rigorous and independent postmarketing studies including core outcome sets for OMPs, enforced by marketing and/or reimbursing authorities aiming to demonstrate real-world effectiveness within a reasonable time frame.
29239447	Carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for intracellular delivery of laronidase in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	The immobilization of proteins on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been widely reported mainly for the preparation of sensors while the conjugation of enzymes for therapeutic purposes has scarcely been considered. Herein we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of intracellular delivery of a therapeutic enzyme by means of CNTs, retaining its activity. Mucopolysaccharidosis I is a rare genetic disease characterized by the deficiency or absence of the activity of the alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme. We evaluated the capacity of the recombinant form of the human IDUA enzyme, laronidase (Aldurazyme ), conjugated with CNTs to be internalized by fibroblasts from subjects affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I and the capacity of the enzyme to retain its activity after internalization. The enzyme was successfully delivered into the lysosomal space and the enzymatic activity of the conjugate was preserved after internalization up to 48 hours. This paves the way towards the use of such a kind of construct for therapeutic applications.
27788836	Outcomes of Long-Term Treatment with Laronidase in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy in patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analyses of case notes, laboratory results, and data from clinical trials were used to evaluate urinary glycosaminoglycans, forced vital capacity (FVC), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), height-for-age Z score, cardiac valve function, corneal clouding, and visual acuity in 35 patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) for up to 10 years following the initiation of laronidase therapy. RESULTS: Statistically significant (P < .001) reductions in mean urinary glycosaminoglycan levels relative to baseline were observed 6 months after treatment initiation and were sustained throughout follow-up. Disease remained stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean FVC, 6MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve function remained stable in 65% (22/34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable in 78% (18/23); visual acuity remained stable in 33% (8/24) and improved in 42% (10/24) of patients. Younger patients (<10 years at treatment initiation) maintained disease measures closer to norms for age for FVC, 6MWT, and height and showed fewer deteriorations in mitral and aortic valve disease and corneal clouding compared with patients aged >=10 years at treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: Laronidase treatment resulted in disease stabilization in the majority of patients with a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. Data suggest that early treatment may result in better outcomes.
38768102	Discovery of allosteric regulators with clinical potential to stabilize alpha-L-iduronidase in mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal disease caused by lowered activity of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Current therapeutic options show limited efficacy and do not treat some important aspects of the disease. Therefore, it may be advantageous to identify strategies that could improve the efficacy of existing treatments. Pharmacological chaperones are small molecules that protect proteins from degradation, and their use in combination with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Using the SEE-Tx  proprietary computational drug discovery platform, a new allosteric ligand binding cavity in IDUA was identified distal from the active site. Virtual high-throughput screening of approximately 5 million compounds using the SEE-Tx  docking platform identified a subset of small molecules that bound to the druggable cavity and functioned as novel allosteric chaperones of IDUA. Experimental validation by differential scanning fluorimetry showed an overall hit rate of 11.4%. Biophysical studies showed that one exemplary hit molecule GT-01803 bound to (Kd = 22 muM) and stabilized recombinant human IDUA (rhIDUA) in a dose-dependent manner. Co-administration of rhIDUA and GT-01803 increased IDUA activity in patient-derived fibroblasts. Preliminary in vivo studies have shown that GT-01803 improved the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rhIDUA, increasing plasma levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GT-01803 also increased IDUA enzymatic activity in bone marrow tissue, which benefits least from standard ERT. Oral bioavailability of GT-01803 was found to be good (50%). Overall, the discovery and validation of a novel allosteric chaperone for rhIDUA presents a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of existing treatments for MPS I. The compound's ability to increase rhIDUA activity in patient-derived fibroblasts and its good oral bioavailability underscore its potential as a potent adjunct to ERT, particularly for addressing aspects of the disease less responsive to standard treatment.
39367605	Engineering Memory T Cells as a platform for Long-Term Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.	Enzymopathy disorders are the result of missing or defective enzymes. Amongst these enzymopathies, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), ultimately causes toxic build-up of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). There is currently no cure and standard treatments provide insufficient relief to the skeletal structure and central nervous system (CNS). Human memory T cells (Tm) migrate throughout the body's tissues and can persist for years, making them an attractive approach for cellular-based, systemic enzyme replacement therapy. Here, we tested genetically engineered, IDUA-expressing Tm as a cellular therapy in an immunodeficient mouse model of MPS I. Our results demonstrate that a single dose of engineered Tm leads to detectable IDUA enzyme levels in the blood for up to 22 weeks and reduced urinary GAG excretion. Furthermore, engineered Tm take up residence in nearly all tested tissues, producing IDUA and leading to metabolic correction of GAG levels in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bone marrow, and the CNS, though only minimal improved cognition was observed. Our study indicates that genetically engineered Tm holds great promise as a platform for cellular-based enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I and potentially many other enzymopathies and protein deficiencies.
29240299	The effect of haemopoietic stem cell transplantation on the ocular phenotype in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler).	PURPOSE: To determine whether the ocular phenotype in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI) Hurler is affected by the efficacy of previous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of patients with MPSI who had undergone treatment with HSCT. METHODS: Ocular phenotype was documented for each patient and compared to levels of biomarkers representing efficacy of previous transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of visual acuity (VA), severity of corneal clouding and the presence of optic neuropathy or retinopathy. Biomarker assessment included dermatan sulphate/chondroitin sulphate (DS/CS) ratio and iduronidase enzyme level. RESULTS: Severe corneal clouding was significantly greater in patients with lower iduronidase levels (p = 0.023) and raised DS/CS ratio (R2  = 0.28 p = 0.043). Better VA was related to a higher iduronidase levels (R2  = 0.15, p = 0.004) and lower DS/CS ratio (R2  = 0.38, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Improved ocular phenotypes in MPSI are associated with markers signifying efficacy of prior transplant. Early and effective HSCT may result in a better visual prognosis and reduction in ocular complications for patients with MPSI.
31060789	Targeting a Pre-existing Anti-transgene T Cell Response for Effective Gene Therapy of MPS-I in the Mouse Model of the Disease.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) is a severe genetic disease caused by a deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme. Ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is a promising therapeutic approach for MPS-I, as demonstrated by preclinical studies performed in naive MPS-I mice. However, after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), several MPS-I patients develop anti-IDUA immunity that may jeopardize ex vivo gene therapy efficacy. Here we treat MPS-I mice with an artificial immunization protocol to mimic the ERT effect in patients, and we demonstrate that IDUA-corrected HSC engraftment is impaired in pre-immunized animals by IDUA-specific CD8+ T cells spared by pre-transplant irradiation. Conversely, humoral anti-IDUA immunity does not impact on IDUA-corrected HSC engraftment. The inclusion of lympho-depleting agents in pre-transplant conditioning of pre-immunized hosts allowes rescue of IDUA-corrected HSC engraftment, which is proportional to CD8+ T cell eradication. Overall, these data demonstrate the relevance of pre-existing anti-transgene T cell immunity on ex vivo HSC gene therapy, and they suggest the application of tailored immune-depleting treatments, as well as a deeper immunological characterization of patients, to safeguard the therapeutic effects of ex vivo HSC gene therapy in immunocompetent hosts.
39865157	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in inborn errors of metabolism-a retrospective analysis on behalf of the pediatric disease working party from the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment for selected patients with inborn errors of metabolism. In this first report from the PDWP-SBTMO, we included 105 patients transplanted between 1988 and 2021 across six Brazilian HSCT centers. The most prevalent diseases were X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 61) and mucopolysaccharidosis (type I n = 20; type II n = 10), with a median age at HSCT of 8.7 years and 2.1 years, respectively. Most conditioning regimens were myeloablative and busulfan-based. With a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the 5-years overall survival (OS) was 75% (95% CI, 0.65-0.82) with a superior 5-years OS for those transplanted after 2010 (87% vs. 63%, p = 0.01). Higher risk of death was associated with the use of haploidentical donor (HR8.86, p 0.021), unrelated cord blood (HR 8.76, p 0.005), unrelated donor (HR 5.91, p 0.02), and for HSCT performed before 2010 (HR 4.16, p = 0.0015). The CI of acute GVHD was 24.8%, while chronic GVHD was 9.5%. Major causes of death were infections (n = 8), GVHD (n = 6), and neurologic progression (n = 3). Despite improvements in transplant outcomes since 2011, challenges persist, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis, timely transplantation and expanding HSCT centers with expertise in the field.
29940298	Intra-articular nonviral gene therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis I mice.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by the lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Currently available treatments may improve several clinical manifestations, but they have limited effects on joint disease, resulting in persistent orthopedic complications and impaired mobility. Thus, this study aimed to perform an intra-articular administration of cationic nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid encoding for the IDUA protein (pIDUA) targeting MPS I gene therapy for the synovial joints. Formulations composed of DOPE, DOTAP, MCT (NE), and DSPE-PEG (NE-PEG) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization, and the pIDUA plasmid was associated by adsorption onto the surface of nanoemulsions (pIDUA/NE or pIDUA/NE-PEG). The physicochemical characterization showed that the presence of DSPE-PEG in pIDUA/NE-PEG formulations led to small and highly stable droplets even when incubated with simulated synovial fluid (SSF), when compared to the non-pegylated complexes (pIDUA/NE). Uptake by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) was demonstrated, and high cell viability (70%) in addition with increased IDUA activity (2.5% of normal) were observed after incubation with pIDUA/NE-PEG. The intra-articular injection of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes in MPS I mice showed that the complexes were localized in the joints, were able to transfect synovial cells, and thus promoted an increase in IDUA activity and expression in the synovial fluid, with no significant activity in other tissues (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen). The overall results demonstrated a contained, safe, tolerable, and effective in situ approach of nonviral intra-articular gene therapy targeting the reduction or prevention of the debilitating orthopedic complications of MPS I disorder.
36494569	Long term follow-up after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for mucopolysaccharidosis type I-H: a retrospective study of 51 patients.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-H (MPS I-H) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-Iduronidase deficiency. Early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the sole available therapeutic option to preserve neurocognitive functions. We report long-term follow-up (median 9 years, interquartile range 8-16.5) for 51 MPS I-H patients who underwent HSCT between 1986 and 2018 in France. 4 patients died from complications of HSCT and one from disease progression. Complete chimerism and normal alpha-L-Iduronidase activity were obtained in 84% and 71% of patients respectively. No difference of outcomes was observed between bone marrow and cord blood stem cell sources. All patients acquired independent walking and 91% and 78% acquired intelligible language or reading and writing. Intelligence Quotient evaluation (n = 23) showed that 69% had IQ >= 70 at last follow-up. 58% of patients had normal or remedial schooling and 62% of the 13 adults had good socio-professional insertion. Skeletal dysplasia as well as vision and hearing impairments progressed despite HSCT, with significant disability. These results provide a long-term assessment of HSCT efficacy in MPS I-H and could be useful in the evaluation of novel promising treatments such as gene therapy.
26602600	Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is very common in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the preferred treatment for patients with severe MPS I diagnosed early in life. The protective effect of HSCT on the development of long term OSAS is not known. METHODS: Overnight polysomnography (PSG) and biomarker data were analyzed during the annual follow-up in consecutive MPS I patients treated with HSCT. RESULTS: The data of 13 patients (6 boys) were analyzed. Median age at HSCT was 17 (range 14-19) months, median age at PSG was 9.0 (4.5-14.5) years, and median time elapsed since HSCT was 7.6 (2.4-13.2) years. A significant correlation was observed between time elapsed since HSCT and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r(2)=0.493, p=+0.003) and the oxygen desaturation index (r(2)=0.424, p=+0.02). Patients older than 10 years of age had a higher mean AHI (25.8/h vs 1.4/h, p=0.0008), a lower mean pulse oximetry (94.7% vs 97.2%, p=0.01) and a higher mean hypopnea index (18.8 vs 0.71/h, p=0.016) as compared to those younger than 10 years of age. No correlation was observed between the AHI and the metabolic clearance, assessed by urine glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion and residual enzyme activity, although there was a positive trend for the urinary GAG/higher normal value for age ratio (p=0.09). CONCLUSION: HSCT does not offer long term protection against OSAS in MPS I with OSAS being documented in all patients after a time elapse since HSCT exceeding 10 years. The potential benefit of additional enzyme replacement therapy needs to be assessed.
28842642	Neonatal umbilical cord blood transplantation halts skeletal disease progression in the murine model of MPS-I.	Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a promising source of stem cells to use in early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) approaches for several genetic diseases that can be diagnosed at birth. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) is a progressive multi-system disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, and patients treated with allogeneic HSCT at the onset have improved outcome, suggesting to administer such therapy as early as possible. Given that the best characterized MPS-I murine model is an immunocompetent mouse, we here developed a transplantation system based on murine UCB. With the final aim of testing the therapeutic efficacy of UCB in MPS-I mice transplanted at birth, we first defined the features of murine UCB cells and demonstrated that they are capable of multi-lineage haematopoietic repopulation of myeloablated adult mice similarly to bone marrow cells. We then assessed the effectiveness of murine UCB cells transplantation in busulfan-conditioned newborn MPS-I mice. Twenty weeks after treatment, iduronidase activity was increased in visceral organs of MPS-I animals, glycosaminoglycans storage was reduced, and skeletal phenotype was ameliorated. This study explores a potential therapy for MPS-I at a very early stage in life and represents a novel model to test UCB-based transplantation approaches for various diseases.
27144408	IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity and Desensitisation with Recombinant Enzymes in Pompe Disease and Type I and Type VI Mucopolysaccharidosis.	Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is important for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders. Hypersensitivity reactions with ERT have been reported, and in these cases, desensitisation with the enzyme is necessary. Here we report the cases of 3 patients with lysosomal storage disorders, including Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I and VI, who had IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions and positive skin tests. Successful desensitisation protocols with the culprit enzyme solution were used for these patients. All 3 patients were able to safely receive ERT with the desensitisation protocol. 
31492863	Human genome-edited hematopoietic stem cells phenotypically correct Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Lysosomal enzyme deficiencies comprise a large group of genetic disorders that generally lack effective treatments. A potential treatment approach is to engineer the patient's own hematopoietic system to express high levels of the deficient enzyme, thereby correcting the biochemical defect and halting disease progression. Here, we present an efficient ex vivo genome editing approach using CRISPR-Cas9 that targets the lysosomal enzyme iduronidase to the CCR5 safe harbor locus in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The modified cells secrete supra-endogenous enzyme levels, maintain long-term repopulation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and can improve biochemical and phenotypic abnormalities in an immunocompromised mouse model of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. These studies provide support for the development of genome-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a potential treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The safe harbor approach constitutes a flexible platform for the expression of lysosomal enzymes making it applicable to other lysosomal storage disorders.
35893030	Early Neonatal Cardiac Phenotype in Hurler Syndrome: Case Report and Literature Review.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare inherited lysosomal disorder caused by deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme, resulting in the progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which interfere with the normal function of multiple tissues and organs. The clinical phenotype includes characteristic facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, umbilical and inguinal hernias, progressive cognitive deficits with corresponding hydrocephalus, and neuropathology. Untreated children do not survive into the second decade. The common cardiac phenotype seen in MPS I and other MPS types includes valve thickening and dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy-usually seen later in the disease course. A 15-month-old ex-35-weeker who presented with cardiomyopathy and left ventricular failure at the age of three weeks is presented here. Early evaluation and diagnosis with the help of newborn screening (NBS), followed by treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), resulted in improvement of his cardiopulmonary status. In MPS I, an early cardiac phenotype is uncommon. Based on the evidence from the literature review for early neonatal cardiac phenotype, we propose that all infants with abnormal newborn screening for MPS I should receive cardiac screening with echocardiogram and NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) during the initial evaluation.
30081189	CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing in human MPS I fibroblasts.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). It is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, which lead to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a new and powerful tool that allows gene editing at precise points of the genome, resulting in gene correction through the introduction and genomic integration of a wildtype sequence. In this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to correct in vitro the most common mutation causing MPS I. Human fibroblasts homozygous for p.Trp402* (legacy name W402X) were transfected and analyzed for up to one month after treatment. IDUA activity was significantly increased, lysosomal mass was decreased, and next generation sequencing confirmed that a percentage of cells carried the wildtype sequence. As a proof of concept, this study demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing may be used to correct causative mutations in MPS I. LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.

33389473	c.1898C>G/p.Ser633Trp Mutation in Alpha-L-Iduronidase: Clinical and Structural Implications.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by deficient activity of alpha-L-iduronidase. As a consequence of low or absent activity of this enzyme, glycosaminoglycans accumulate in the lysosomal compartments of multiple cell types throughout the body. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes, ranging from a severe Hurler form to the more attenuated Hurler-Scheie and Scheie phenotypes. Over 200 gene variants causing the various forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type I have been reported. DNA isolated from dried blood spot was used to sequencing of all exons of the IDUA gene from a patient with a clinical phenotype of severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I syndrome. Enzyme activity of alpha-L-iduronidase was quantified by fluorimetric assay. Additionally, a molecular dynamics simulation approach was used to determine the effect of the Ser633Trp mutation on the structure and dynamics of the alpha-L-iduronidase. The DNA sequencing analysis and enzymatic activity shows a c.1898C>G mutation associated a patient with a homozygous state and alpha-L-iduronidase activity of 0.24 mumol/L/h, respectively. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis shows that the p.Ser633Trp mutation on the alpha-L-iduronidase affect significant the temporal and spatial properties of the different structural loops, the N-glycan attached to Asn372 and amino acid residues around the catalytic site of this enzyme. Low enzymatic activity observed for p.Ser633Trp variant of the alpha-L-iduronidase seems to lead to severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I phenotype, possibly associated with a perturbation of the structural dynamics in regions of the enzyme close to the active site.
34547335	Evidence of Treatment Benefits in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I-Hurler in Long-term Follow-up Using a New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring System.	We developed a brain and spine magnetic resonance scoring system based on a magnetic resonance assessment of 9 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The score is reliable and correlates with long-term clinical and cognitive outcome in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler.
33573568	Gene Therapy of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Mice: Repeated Administrations and Safety Assessment of pIDUA/Nanoemulsion Complexes.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency. The available treatments are not effective in improving all signs and symptoms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the transfection efficiency of repeated intravenous administrations of cationic nanoemulsions associated with the plasmid pIDUA (containing IDUA gene). METHODS: Cationic nanoemulsions were composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(amino[polyethylene glycol]- 2000) (DSPE-PEG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), medium- chain triglycerides, glycerol, and water and were prepared by high-pressure homogenization and were repeatedly administered to MPS I mice for IDUA production and gene expression. RESULTS: A significant increase in IDUA expression was observed in all organs analyzed, and IDUA activity tended to increase with repeated administrations when compared to our previous report when mice received a single administration of the same dose. In addition, GAGs were partially cleared from organs, as assessed through biochemical and histological analyzes. There was no presence of inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, or signs of an increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed a reduced presence of macrophage cells in treated than in untreated MPS I mice. CONCLUSION: These sets of results suggest that repeated administrations can improve transfection efficiency of cationic complexes without a significant increase in toxicity in the MPS I murine model.
36333985	18-year follow-up of enzyme-replacement therapy in two siblings with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase and characterized by a progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, MPS I is divided into two forms: (1) severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement; (2) attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which displays a slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated MPS I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present updated data after 18 years of laronidase treatment in two siblings affected by the attenuated form of MPS I who started therapy at 5 months and 5 years of age, respectively. Clinical and laboratory data of the siblings show that long-term enzyme replacement therapy may improve/stabilize many symptoms already present at the time of the diagnosis and reduce the disease progression. This study confirms that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy are essential to modify positively the natural history of the attenuated form of MPS I.
39111602	Synergistic effects of resveratrol and enzyme replacement therapy in the Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, leading to alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme deficiency and resulting in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG; heparan and dermatan sulfate) in lysosomes. The consequent GAG accumulation within cells leads to organ dysfunction and a range of debilitating symptoms. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the prevailing treatment, but its limitations (including high cost, time requirements, inefficiency in treatment of central nervous system (CNS), and immunogenicity) necessitate exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. This research propose a novel approach leveraging the synergistic effects of ERT and resveratrol-induced autophagy. Resveratrol, with its immunomodulatory and GAG degradation-stimulating properties, holds a promise in mitigating immune responses triggered by ERT. Moreover, its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier presents a potential solution for addressing CNS manifestations. This study employed cells from MPS I patients to investigate the combined effects of resveratrol and the enzyme. Evaluation of the therapeutic impact involved assessing GAG accumulation enzyme testing, and examining lysosome functionality and the autophagy process through fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting. The combined therapy stimulated the lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and lysosome biogenesis through the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Additionally, initial block of autophagy in autophagosome formation was relieved after the combined therapy and resveratrol alone. Together with increased enzyme activity through stimulation of the receptor, this synergistic therapy can be considered a new potential treatment for MPS I patients, improving their overall quality of life.
28595620	Transcranial pulsed ultrasound facilitates brain uptake of laronidase in enzyme replacement therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I disease.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a debilitating hereditary disease characterized by alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and consequent inability to degrade glycosaminoglycans. The pathological accumulation of glycosaminoglycans systemically results in severe mental retardation and multiple organ dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) improves the function of some organs but not neurological deficits owing to its exclusion from the brain by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: We divided MPS I mice into control group, enzyme replacement group with rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg injection, enzyme replacement with one-spot ultrasound treatment group, and enzyme replacement with two-spot ultrasound treatment group, and compare treatment effectiveness between groups. All ultrasound treatments were applied on left side brain. Evans blue was used to simulate the distribution of rhIDU in the brain. RESULTS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles facilitates brain rhIDU delivery in MPS I mice receiving systemic enzyme replacement therapy. With intravenously injected rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg, the IDUA enzyme activity on the ultrasound treated side of the cerebral hemisphere raised to 7.81-fold that on the untreated side and to 75.84% of its normal value. Evans blue simulation showed the distribution of the delivered drug was extensive, involving a large volume of the treated cerebral hemisphere. Two-spot ultrasound treatment scheme is more efficient for brain rhIDU delivery than one-spot ultrasound treatment scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound can open BBB extensively and facilitates brain rhIDU delivery. This novel technology may provide a new MPS I treatment strategy.
26592960	Monitoring of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses types I and II on enzyme replacement therapy - Results of a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of rare, inherited metabolic disorders which result from the lack of one of the lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Early recognition of MPS is important as it enables prompt implementation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a ubiquitous ectopeptidase which activity has been associated with the cell surface protein CD26. Our aims were to investigate plasma DPP-IV activity in untreated patients with MPS type II in comparison to control individuals and to evaluate changes of DPP-IV during ERT in MPS I or II patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: One MPS I and five MPS II patients were treated with ERT for up to 19 months. DPP-IV activity was measured in plasma with a colorimetric method using Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide as a substrate. The reference intervals were observed in 17 healthy donors and in 9 MPS II individuals before ERT implementation. RESULTS: DPP-IV activity ranged from 557 to 1959 nmol/ml/h (median and interquartile range: 1453 [955- 1554], n = 17) in plasma of control samples. In 9 untreated MPS II individuals, DPP-IV activity was higher and ranged from 2565 to 5968 nmol/ml/h (median and interquartile range: 4458 [4031-5161]). In 6 MPS patients receiving ERT, DPP-IV activity ranged from 2984 to 8628 nmol/ml/h. No declining tendency was observed during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: DPP-IV activity is a good, newa nd valuable biomarker distinguishing between MPS and healthy individuals. However, it is not a useful marker of treatment efficacy and is unsuitable for monitoring.
28150116	Subcutaneous implantation of microencapsulated cells overexpressing alpha-L-iduronidase for mucopolysaccharidosis type I treatment.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), resulting in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in lysosomes. Microencapsulation of recombinant cells is a promising gene/cell therapy approach that could overcome the limitations of the current available treatments. In the present study we produced alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules containing recombinant cells overexpressing IDUA, which were implanted in the subcutaneous space of MPS I mice in order to evaluate their potential effect as a treatment for this disease. APA microcapsules enclosing genetically modified Baby Hamster Kidney cells overexpressing IDUA were produced and implanted in the subcutaneous space of 4-month-old MPS I mice (Idua -/-). Treatment was performed using two cell concentrations: 8.3 x 107 and 8.3 x 106 cells/mL. Untreated MPS I and normal mice were used as controls. Microcapsules were retrieved and analyzed after treatment. Increased IDUA in the liver, kidney and heart was detected 24 h postimplantation. After 120 days, higher IDUA activity was detected in the liver, kidney and heart, in both groups, whereas GAG accumulation was reduced only in the high cell concentration group. Microcapsules analysis showed blood vessels around them, as well as inflammatory cells and a fibrotic layer. Microencapsulated cells were able to ameliorate some aspects of the disease, indicating their potential as a treatment. To achieve better performance of the microcapsules, improvements such as the modulation of inflammatory response are suggested.
31827259	Neonatal nonviral gene editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system improves some cardiovascular, respiratory, and bone disease features of the mucopolysaccharidosis I phenotype in mice.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), leading to multisystemic accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Untreated MPS I patients may die in the first decades of life, mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory complications. We previously reported that the treatment of newborn MPS I mice with intravenous administration of lipossomal CRISPR/Cas9 complexes carrying the murine Idua gene aiming at the ROSA26 locus resulted in long-lasting IDUA activity and GAG reduction in various tissues. Following this, the present study reports the effects of gene editing in cardiovascular, respiratory, bone, and neurologic functions in MPS I mice. Bone morphology, specifically the width of zygomatic and femoral bones, showed partial improvement. Although heart valves were still thickened, cardiac mass and aortic elastin breaks were reduced, with normalization of aortic diameter. Pulmonary resistance was normalized, suggesting improvement in respiratory function. In contrast, behavioral abnormalities and neuroinflammation still persisted, suggesting deterioration of the neurological functions. The set of results shows that gene editing performed in newborn animals improved some manifestations of the MPS I disorder in bone, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. However, further studies will be imperative to find better delivery strategies to reach "hard-to-treat" tissues to ensure better systemic and neurological effects.
34033424	A few challenges in mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Here we describe the current challenges of mucopolysaccharidosis type I: the need for an adequate classification, establishing its relationship to therapeutic indications; an early diagnosis, from neonatal screening, its advantages and barriers, to clinical suspicion of severe and attenuated forms; spinal and eye disease care, from diagnosis to follow-up and treatment; allergic reactions caused by enzyme replacement therapy, their diagnosis and treatment. And lastly, transition to adult care.
28211988	Intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy reverses cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that seriously affects the brain. Severity of neurocognitive symptoms in attenuated MPS subtype (MPS IA) broadly varies partially, due to restricted permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) which limits treatment effects of intravenously applied alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) enzyme. Intrathecal (IT) rhIDU application as a possible solution to circumvent BBB improved brain outcomes in canine models; therefore, our study quantifies effects of IT rhIDU on brain structure and function in an MPS IA patient with previous progressive cognitive decline. Neuropsychological testing and MRIs were performed twice prior (baseline, at 1 year) and twice after initiating IT rhIDU (at 2nd and 3rd years). The difference between pre- and post-treatment means was evaluated as a percentage of the change. Neurocognitive performance improved particularly in memory tests and resulted in improved school performance after IT rhIDU treatment. White matter (WM) integrity improved together with an increase of WM and corpus callosum volumes. Hippocampal and gray matter volume decreased which may either parallel reduction of glycosaminoglycan storage or reflect typical longitudinal brain changes in early adulthood. In conclusion, our outcomes suggest neurological benefits of IT rhIDU compared to the intravenous administration on brain structure and function in a single MPS IA patient.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
28193245	Early disease progression of Hurler syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Newborn screening for mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) shows promise to improve outcomes by facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. However, diagnostic tests for MPS I are of limited value in predicting whether a child will develop severe central nervous system disease associated with Hurler syndrome, or minimal or no central nervous system involvement associated with the attenuated phenotypes (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes). Given that the optimal treatment differs between Hurler syndrome and the attenuated MPS I phenotypes, the absence of a reliable prognostic biomarker complicates clinical decision making for infants diagnosed through newborn screening. Information about the natural history of Hurler syndrome may aid in the management of affected infants, contribute to treatment decisions, and facilitate evaluation of treatment effectiveness and prognosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the progression and timing of symptom onset in infants with Hurler syndrome. RESULTS: Clinical data from 55 patients evaluated at a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Information about each child's medical history was obtained following a standardized protocol including a thorough parent interview and the review of previous medical records. All patients underwent systematic physical and neurodevelopmental evaluations by a multidisciplinary team. Nearly all patients (98%) showed signs of disease during the first 6 months of life. Common early disease manifestations included failed newborn hearing screen, respiratory symptoms, difficulty latching, and otitis media. Other symptoms such as kyphosis, corneal clouding, cardiac disease, joint restrictions, and enlarged head circumference typically appeared slightly later (median age, 8-10 months). During the first 12 months, gross motor development was the most severely affected area of functioning, and a significant number of patients also experienced language delays. Cognition was typically preserved during this period. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome, the vast majority showed signs and symptoms of disease during the first months of life. More research is needed to determine the extent to which early clinical manifestations of MPS I can predict phenotype and treatment outcomes.
30777108	An online survey on burden of illness among families with post-stem cell transplant mucopolysaccharidosis type I children in the United States.	BACKGROUND: Severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I (also known as Hurler syndrome) is a rare devasting recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of an enzyme. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the standard of care in the United States, usually conducted before the child is 3 years of age, but little is known about the continued medical and educational needs of the child after transplant. A greater understanding of the burden of illness on the primary caregiver is also needed. Therefore, this online survey sought to gather information on the burden of severe MPS I in the United States at least 1 year after transplant. RESULTS: Thirty-two respondents reported that children with severe MPS I have significant medical and educational needs after transplant. Healthcare resource use was frequent, especially in the outpatient setting specifically for bone, cardiac, and vision complications that were not relieved by HSCT. Twenty-five percent of the children had been hospitalized at least once in the last year and two had been hospitalized twice. The most common reasons for overnight hospitalizations included orthopedic surgeries and respiratory infections. Among children ages 5 and older, only 3 of 28 (11%) were able to attend school with no special support. While caregivers were generally satisfied with the healthcare services their child receives, 69% of working caregivers reported negative impact on their ability to conduct work tasks, and 54% of caregivers did not work so that they could care for the child. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that severe MPS I children continue to  require medical care and special support for education. Future research on the burden of illness on families affected by severe MPS I is needed to better understand total cost of care, and to identify therapies and interventions that reduce burden of illness. Future studies that compare cost of and access to health care in different countries may provide a more global view of the burden of MPS I.
35056405	Proposal of an Algorithm to Early Detect Attenuated Type I Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS Ia) among Children with Growth Abnormalities.	Background and Objectives: Diagnostic delay is common in attenuated Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS Ia) due to the rarity of the disease and the variability of clinical presentation. Short stature and impaired growth velocity are frequent findings in MPS Ia, but they rarely raise suspicion as paediatric endocrinologists are generally poorly trained to detect earlier and milder clinical signs of this condition. Materials and Methods: Following a consensus-based methodology, a multidisciplinary panel including paediatric endocrinologists, paediatricians with expertise in metabolic disorders, radiologists, and rheumatologists shared their experience on a possible clinical approach to the diagnosis of MPS Ia in children with short stature or stunted growth. Results: The result was the formation of an algorithm that illustrates how to raise the suspicion of MPS Ia in a patient older than 5 years with short stature and suggestive clinical signs. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm may represent a useful tool to improve the awareness of paediatric endocrinologists and reduce the diagnostic delay for patients with MPS Ia.
38397051	Efficacy of a Combination Therapy with Laronidase and Genistein in Treating Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I in a Mouse Model.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency. The standard treatment, enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase, has limited effectiveness in treating neurological symptoms due to poor blood-brain barrier penetration. An alternative is substrate reduction therapy using molecules, such as genistein, which crosses this barrier. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of laronidase and genistein in a mouse model of MPS I. Over 12 weeks, MPS I and wild-type mice received laronidase, genistein, or both. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage in visceral organs and the brain, its excretion in urine, and the serum level of the heparin cofactor II-thrombin (HCII-T) complex, along with behavior, were assessed. The combination therapy resulted in reduced GAG storage in the heart and liver, whereas genistein alone reduced the brain GAG storage. Laronidase and combination therapy decreased liver and spleen weights and significantly reduced GAG excretion in the urine. However, this therapy negated some laronidase benefits in the HCII-T levels. Importantly, the combination therapy improved the behavior of female mice with MPS I. These findings offer valuable insights for future research to optimize MPS I treatments.
34725353	Self-inactivating, all-in-one AAV vectors for precision Cas9 genome editing via homology-directed repair in vivo.	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important delivery platforms for therapeutic genome editing but are severely constrained by cargo limits. Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy and increase safety risks. Here, we describe single-vector, ~4.8-kb AAV platforms that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs for segmental deletions, or a single sgRNA with a homology-directed repair (HDR) template. We also use anti-CRISPR proteins to enable production of vectors that self-inactivate via Nme2Cas9 cleavage. We further introduce a nanopore-based sequencing platform that is designed to profile rAAV genomes and serves as a quality control measure for vector homogeneity. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice by HDR-based correction of the disease allele. These results will enable the engineering of single-vector AAVs that can achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.
32713717	The evolution of pulmonary function in childhood onset Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Respiratory outcomes in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), have mainly focused on upper airway obstruction, with the evolution of the restrictive lung disease being poorly documented. We report the long-term pulmonary function outcomes and examine the potential factors affecting these in 2 cohorts of MPS I patients, those who have undergone Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and those treated with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). The results were stratified using the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. 66 patients, capable of adequately performing testing, were identified by a retrospective case note review, 46 transplanted (45 Hurler, 1 Non-Hurler) and 20 having ERT (17 Non-Hurler and 3 Hurler diagnosed too late for HSCT). 5 patients died; 4 in the ERT group including the 3 Hurler patients. Overall 14% of patients required respiratory support (non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or supplemental oxygen)) at the end of follow up. Median length of follow-up was 12.2 (range = 4.9-32) years post HSCT and 14.34 (range = 3.89-20.4) years on ERT. All patients had restrictive lung disease. Cobb angle and male sex were significantly associated with more severe outcomes in the HSCT cohort, with 49% having severe to very severe disease. In the 17 Non-Hurler ERT treated patients there was no variable predictive of severity of disease with 59% having severe to very severe disease. During the course of follow up 67% of the HSCT cohort had no change or improved pulmonary function as did 52% of the ERT patients. However, direct comparison between therapeutic modalities was not possible. This initial evidence would suggest that a degree of restrictive lung disease is present in all treated paediatrically diagnosed MPS I and is still a significant cause of morbidity, though further stratification incorporating diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is needed.
29409846	Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiovascular Risk Factors after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Severe Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (Hurler Syndrome).	Hematopoietic cell transplantation is a life-saving procedure, but one associated with increasing long-term cardiovascular risk requiring frequent long-term follow-up. This therapy has significantly lengthened survival in mucopolysaccharidosis type IH (Hurler syndrome), a disease with known coronary artery involvement. Metabolic syndrome-a constellation of central obesity, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose-is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and occurs when any 3 or more of these 5 components is present within a single individual. The incidence of metabolic syndrome and its components is poorly defined after transplantation for Hurler syndrome. Chart review of all long-term survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation for Hurler syndrome >=9 years of age for factors comprising the metabolic syndrome: obesity, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose. Sixty-three patients were evaluated, 20 of whom had components of the metabolic syndrome available for review. There was no significant difference in age at transplantation, sex, number of transplants, pretransplant radiation, or percent engraftment between those with and without these data. Median follow-up after transplantation for the 20 patients with data was 14.3 years. Only 1 (5%) patient of this group fulfilled the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Fifty-three percent of the patients had 1 or more components of metabolic syndrome: the most common was high blood pressure occurring in 40%. Metabolic syndrome is uncommon in this cohort of long-term survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation for Hurler syndrome but almost half of the patients had 1 or more components of the syndrome, with high blood pressure being the most common. Further studies are needed to develop guidelines in this diagnosis as well as other nonmalignant diseases of children.
30170069	In vivo genome editing of mucopolysaccharidosis I mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a multisystemic disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) that leads to intracellular accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). In the present study we aimed to use cationic liposomes carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid and a donor vector for in vitro and in vivo MPS I gene editing, and compare to treatment with naked plasmids. The liposomal formulation was prepared by microfluidization. Complexes were obtained by the addition of DNA at +4/-1 charge ratio. The overall results showed complexes of about 110 nm, with positive zeta potential of +30 mV. The incubation of the complexes with fibroblasts from MPS I patients led to a significant increase in IDUA activity and reduction of lysosomal abnormalities. Hydrodynamic injection of the liposomal complex in newborn MPS I mice led to a significant increase in serum IDUA levels for up to six months. The biodistribution of complexes after hydrodynamic injection was markedly detected in the lungs and heart, corroborating the results of increased IDUA activity and decreased GAG storage especially in these tissues, while the group that received the naked plasmids presented increased enzyme activity especially in the liver. Furthermore, animals treated with the liposomal formulation presented improvement in cardiovascular parameters, one of the main causes of death observed in MPS I patients. We conclude that the IDUA production in multiple organs had a significant beneficial effect on the characteristics of MPS I disease, which may bring hope to gene therapy of Hurler patients.
26832957	Enzyme replacement therapy prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: 10 year combined experience of 2 centres.	Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for the severe form of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I, or Hurler syndrome. In many centres standard practice is to deliver enzyme replacement therapy alongside haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to improve the condition of the patient prior to transplant. We report the combined 10 year experience of this approach in two paediatric metabolic and transplant centres. Of 81 patients who underwent a first transplant procedure for Hurler, 88% (71/81) survived and 81% (66/81) were alive and engrafted at a median follow-up of 46 months (range 3-124 months). The incidence of grade II-IV acute and any chronic graft versus host disease was 17% and 11% respectively. Urinary glycosaminoglycans were significantly reduced after a period of enzyme replacement therapy, and further reductions were seen at 13-24 months and 25+months after transplantation. In several individuals with decreased cardiac contractility, an improvement of their condition during enzyme replacement therapy enabled them to undergo transplantation, with one individual receiving full intensity conditioning.
32442432	Comparison of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and urine in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I receiving intravenous and intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy.	AIMS: To validate a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the measurement of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in plasma and serum. To establish plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine reference intervals. To compare GAGs in serum with that in urine and CSF from patients with MPS I. METHODS: Dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) in serum/plasma, urine and CSF were methanolysed into dimers and analyzed using pseudo isotope dilution UPLC-MS/MS assay. Serum, CSF and urine DS and HS were quantified for 11 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I before and after treatment with Aldurazyme  (laronidase) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). RESULTS: The method showed acceptable imprecision and recovery for the quantification of serum/plasma CS, DS, and HS. The serum, urine, and CSF DS and HS concentrations were reduced after 26 weeks of ERT in 4 previously untreated patients. Serum DS and HS concentrations normalized in some patients, and were mildly elevated in others after ERT. In contrast, urine and CSF DS and HS values remained elevated above the reference ranges. Compared with serum GAGs, urine and CSF DS and HS were more sensitive biomarkers for monitoring the ERT treatment of patients with MPS I.
32036849	Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I in Children, a Forgotten Diagnosis Responsible for Undiagnosed Musculoskeletal Complaints: Report of Two Cases.	Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders. The underlying mechanism of MPS disorders are deficiency in specific enzymes which leads to accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues. A wide variety of manifestations are reported but musculoskeletal complaints are common among them. In milder forms of MPS, musculoskeletal complaints are presenting symptoms. Delays in diagnosis due to unspecific and mild symptoms is common. Misdiagnosis of MPS as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other inflammatory arthritis disorders is frequent. Early diagnosis and treatment prevents irreversible cellular damages and is a key factor in efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy. In this study we described two MPS patients with musculoskeletal complaints who were not diagnosed for a period of time. Although musculoskeletal manifestation are common in a variety of clinical conditions, their presence at low ages or co-occurrence of other manifestations (such as cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, etc.) in multiple systems should prompt evaluation of patients for MPS and other metabolic disorders. The rheumatologists' awareness on MPS should be promoted to achieve timely diagnosis and subsequent early treatment.
28684085	Incomplete biomarker response in mucopolysaccharidosis type I after successful hematopoietic cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Residual disease, primarily involving musculoskeletal tissue, is a common problem in patients with neuronopathic mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I, Hurler or severe Hurler-Scheie phenotype) after a successful hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The concentration of the GAG derived biomarkers heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), may reflect residual disease and is used for monitoring biochemical response to therapies. This study investigates the response of HS and DS in blood and urine to HCT in MPS I patients. METHODS: In 143 blood- and urine samples of 17 neuronophatic MPS I patients, collected prior and post successful HCT, the concentration of the disaccharides derived after full enzymatic digestion of HS and DS were analyzed by multiplex liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Median follow up after HCT was 2.4years (range 0-11years). HCT led to a rapid decrease of both HS and DS. However, only 38% of the patients reached normal HS levels in blood and even less patients (6%) reached normal DS levels. In none of the patients normalization of HS or DS was observed in urine. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker response after HCT is incomplete, which may reflect residual disease activity. Novel therapeutic strategies should aim for full metabolic correction to minimize clinical manifestations.
29122734	Gene editing of MPS I human fibroblasts by co-delivery of a CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid and a donor oligonucleotide using nanoemulsions as nonviral carriers.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited disease caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). This study shows the use of nanoemulsions co-complexed with the plasmid of CRISPR/Cas9 system and a donor oligonucleotide aiming at MPS I gene editing in vitro. Nanoemulsions composed of MCT, DOPE, DOTAP, DSPE-PEG, and water were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. The DNA was complexed by adsorption (NA) or encapsulation (NE) of preformed DNA/DOTAP complexes with nanoemulsions at +4/-1 charge ratio. The incubation in pure DMEM or supplemented with serum showed that the complexation with DNA was stable after 1 h of incubation, but the complexes tended to release the adsorbed DNA after 24 h of incubation, while the encapsulated DNA remained complexed in the oil core of the nanoemulsions even 48 h after incubation with DMEM. The treatment of MPS I patient's fibroblasts homozygous for the p.Trp402* mutation led to a significant increase in IDUA activity at 2, 15, and 30 days when compared to MPS I untreated fibroblasts. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy demonstrated that there was a reduction in the area of lysosomes to values similar to normal, an indicator of correction of the cellular phenotype. These results show that the nanoemulsions co-complexed with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a donor oligonucleotide could effectively transfect MPS I p.Trp402* patient's fibroblasts, as well as enable the production of IDUA, and represent a potential new treatment option for MPS I.
26965916	12 year follow up of enzyme-replacement therapy in two siblings with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis I: the important role of early treatment.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase and characterized by a progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated Mucopolysaccharidosis type I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12-year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy from the age of 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.
33443965	Quantifying the Effects of Hip Surgery on the Sphericity of the Femoral Head in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.	BACKGROUND: The introduction of stem cell transplantation has improved life expectancy and cognitive outcome in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, but this condition remains associated with substantial residual disease in several parts of the body. Many patients have hip dysplasia with progressive medial flattening of the femoral head. Quantitative evidence on the effect of surgery on remodeling to sphericity of flattened femoral heads is lacking. In the present study, we used statistical shape modeling to quantify the effect of hip surgery on the sphericity of the femoral head in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case control study involving a series of 23 patients with hip dysplasia due to mucopolysaccharidosis I. Surgery was not offered to the first 11 children (control group). Following a change in treatment protocol, the next 12 children underwent bilateral proximal femoral varus derotation osteotomy and Pemberton osteotomy for the treatment of acetabular dysplasia with progressive femoral head flattening (surgery group). The surgery and control groups were compared with a reference group of patients with normal hips. Statistical shape modeling was used to quantify the shape of the femoral head (i.e., flattening and/or roundness of the epiphysis). RESULTS: The mean age at the time of stem cell transplantation in the surgery and control groups was comparable (1.2 years). The mean age at the time of surgical intervention was 5.5 years, and mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 3.3 years. Statistical shape modeling showed variations within the total group in terms of medial indentation, width, height, and sphericity of the femoral heads. In contrast to the progressive femoral head flattening in the control group, the surgery group showed improvement of the sphericity of the femoral head after surgery. The overall shape characteristics of the femoral head in the surgery group were similar to those of the reference group of patients with normal hips. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I that has shown quantitative remodeling of the dysplastic, flattened femoral head to normal sphericity after increasing containment of the femoral head. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
37582469	Incidence of bloodstream infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant for Hurler Syndrome.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the lysosome. Hurler syndrome is the most severe form of MPS I, manifesting as multiorgan dysfunction, cognitive delay, and death, usually within ten years if left untreated. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the optimal treatment option since it provides a permanent solution to enzyme deficiency and halts cognitive decline. However, transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) are HSCT complications that are also known risk factors for bloodstream infections (BSI). BSIs are a serious complication of HSCT, contributing to poor outcomes and transplant-related morbidity. There are little data evaluating BSI after HSCT in the Hurler patient population. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with Hurler syndrome who underwent HSCT at our center between 2013 and 2020 to determine the incidence of BSI within the first-year post-transplant. Twenty-five patients were included in the analysis; the majority (n=17, 68%) were male, with a median age of 1.1 years (IQR 0.35 to 1.44) at the time of transplant. The most common graft source was cord blood (n=15, 54%), followed by bone marrow (n=13, 46%), with the majority from matched unrelated donors (n=14, 52%) and mismatched unrelated donors (n=13, 44%). Sixteen BSIs were diagnosed in 12 patients (n=12, 48%). Most infections (n=7, 43.8%) were diagnosed in the first 20 days after transplant, with fewer infections being observed at later time points. The incidence rate of BSIs in Hurlers patients (n=12, 48%) was higher than the reported general pediatric HSCT population one-year post-transplant (15-35%). Given the high rate of Hurlers patients diagnosed with both TA-TMA and a BSI (n=7, 78%), we suspect a possible correlation between the two. Additionally, due to the time it takes for GAG levels to normalize post-HSCT in Hurlers patients, it is reasonable to suspect that the high BSI rates in these patients are linked to their Hurlers diagnosis.
37542767	Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Mucopolysaccharidosis I in the presence of decreased cardiac function.	BACKGROUND: Severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I, (MPS IH) is a rare inherited lysosomal disorder resulting in progressive storage of proteoglycans (GAGs) in central nervous system and somatic tissues and, if left untreated, causing death within the first decade of life. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) arrests many of the features of MPS IH but carries a 10-15% risk of mortality. Decreased cardiac function can occur in MPS IH and increase the risk of HCT. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed to determine the long-term outcome of individuals evaluated for HCT with MPS IH who had decreased cardiac function as measured by cardiac echocardiogram (echo) and ejection fraction (EF) of <50% at the time of initial evaluation. RESULTS: Six patients ranging in age from 1 week to 21 months (median: 4 months) had EFs ranging from 25 to 47% (median: 32%) at diagnosis and were initiated on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with improvement in EF in three patients by 5 months. The remaining three patients continued to have EFs <50% and continuous milrinone infusion was added in the pre-HCT period. On average, milrinone infusion was able to be discontinued post-HCT, prior to hospital discharge, within a mean of 37 days. Five patients survived HCT and are alive today with normal EFs. One patient receiving milrinone died of sepsis during HCT with a normal EF. CONCLUSION: Decreased cardiac systolic function in infants with MPS IH that fails to normalize with ERT alone may benefit from the addition of continuous milrinone infusion during HCT.
32311562	Treatment of Severe Kyphoscoliosis in Children with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (Pfaundler-Hurler Syndrome) Using the Growing Rod Technique: A Case Series with Mid-Term Results.	BACKGROUND: Patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) have a good life expectancy due to early therapeutic options, such as stem cell therapy. Stem cell therapy can prevent the progression of some skeletal malformations. In contrast, the progression of thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, genua vara, and hip dysplasia cannot be influenced. We present 3 cases of children with MPS I with thoracolumbar kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis treated with a growing rod system. CASE DESCRIPTION: The medical records and radiologic imaging of 3 children with a diagnosis of MPS I and kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis of the lumbar spine treated between 2007 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Two children presented with a kyphoscoliosis, and 1 child had a combination of severe anterolisthesis and kyphoscoliosis. Surgery to correct the kyphosis and dorsal stabilization was performed in all patients after exhausted conservative treatment. There were no neurologic complications. Postoperative treatment and aftercare included a corset for 4 months and physical therapy. In all 3 patients, distraction surgery of the lumbar stabilization was done twice at a mean interval of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: If conservative treatment fails and surgery is necessary, an individual approach is needed. Dorsal stabilization with pedicle screws using a growing rod technique is an option for the correction of thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis in children with MPS I. However, fusion should be prevented initially or should be kept as short as possible. We achieved acceptable correction of the spinal deformity using the growing rod technique. Finally, surgery with correction and fusion is necessary after exhausted correction potential.
27392569	Musculoskeletal manifestations in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.
29976218	Neurocognitive and somatic stabilization in pediatric patients with severe Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I after 52 weeks of intravenous brain-penetrating insulin receptor antibody-iduronidase fusion protein (valanafusp alpha): an open label phase 1-2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type I (MPSI) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), and a majority of patients present with severe neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Recombinant IDUA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enable BBB transport, IDUA was re-engineered as an IgG-IDUA fusion protein, valanafusp alpha, where the IgG domain targets the BBB human insulin receptor to enable transport of the enzyme into the brain. We report the results of a 52-week clinical trial on the safety and efficacy of valanafusp alpha in pediatric MPSI patients with cognitive impairment. In the phase I trial, 6 adults with attenuated MPSI were administered 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg doses of valanafusp alpha by intravenous (IV) infusion. In the phase II trial, 11 pediatric subjects, 2-15 years of age, were treated for 52 weeks with weekly IV infusions of valanafusp alpha at 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg. Assessments of adverse events, cognitive stabilization, and somatic stabilization were made. Outcomes at 52 weeks were compared to baseline. RESULTS: Drug related adverse events included infusion related reactions, with an incidence of 1.7%, and transient hypoglycemia, with an incidence of 6.4%. The pediatric subjects had CNS involvement with a mean enrollment Development Quotient (DQ) of 36.1+-7.1. The DQ, and the cortical grey matter volume of brain, were stabilized by valanafusp alpha treatment. Somatic manifestations were stabilized, or improved, based on urinary glycosaminoglycan levels, hepatic and spleen volumes, and shoulder range of motion. CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence of the cognitive and somatic stabilization indicates that valanafusp alpha is transported into both the CNS and into peripheral organs due to its dual targeting mechanism via the insulin receptor and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. This novel fusion protein offers a pharmacologic approach to the stabilization of cognitive function in MPSI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.Gov, NCT03053089 .

35563175	Nanoemulsions as Gene Delivery in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I-A Mini-Review.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare monogenic disease in which glycosaminoglycans' abnormal metabolism leads to the storage of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in various tissues. It causes its damage and impairment. Patients with the severe form of MPS I usually do not live up to the age of ten. Currently, the therapy is based on multidisciplinary care and enzyme replacement therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Applying gene therapy might benefit the MPS I patients because it overcomes the typical limitations of standard treatments. Nanoparticles, including nanoemulsions, are used more and more in medicine to deliver a particular drug to the target cells. It allows for creating a specific, efficient therapy method in MPS I and other lysosomal storage disorders. This article briefly presents the basics of nanoemulsions and discusses the current state of knowledge about their usage in mucopolysaccharidosis type I.
31839529	Intrathecal enzyme replacement for cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot study.	Central nervous system manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) such as cognitive impairment, hydrocephalus, and spinal cord compression are inadequately treated by intravenously-administered enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase). While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treats neurological symptoms, this therapy is not generally offered to attenuated MPS I patients. This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot study of intrathecal laronidase in eight attenuated MPS I patients with cognitive impairment. Subjects ranged between 12 years and 50 years old with a median age of 18 years. All subjects had received intravenous laronidase prior to the study over a range of 4 to 10 years, with a mean of 7.75 years. Weekly intravenous laronidase was continued throughout the duration of the study. The randomization period was one year, during which control subjects attended all study visits and assessments, but did not receive any intrathecal laronidase. After the first year, all eight subjects received treatment for one additional year. There was no significant difference in neuropsychological assessment scores between control or treatment groups, either over the one-year randomized period or at 18 or 24 months. However, there was no significant decline in scores in the control group either. Adverse events included pain (injection site, back, groin), headache, neck spasm, and transient blurry vision. There were seven serious adverse events, one judged as possibly related (headache requiring hospitalization). There was no significant effect of intrathecal laronidase on cognitive impairment in older, attenuated MPS I patients over a two-year treatment period. A five-year open-label extension study is underway.
28410878	Efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I who initiated enzyme replacement therapy in adult age. A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of starting enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in adults with Muchopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS-I) is controversial. Evaluating the benefits reported by patients initiating ERT with laronidase at adult age might help physicians decide whether the use of ERT in these patients is worthwhile from a clinical point of view. OBJECTIVE: To assess every effectiveness variable modified in MPS-I patients who initiated laronidase at adult age. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, from inception to July 2016, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS to identify randomized trials or observational studies including >=1 MPS-I patients with ERT initiated in adult age (>=18years) and evaluating ERT efficacy. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating the same effectiveness outcome was performed and the evidence was rated according to GRADE criteria. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Chi-squared test and the I-squared statistic. Case reports were excluded from meta-analysis but their main outcomes were separately evaluated. The decrease in urine glycosaminoglycans (uGAGs) levels as patient percentage with reduction in uGAGs and with normalization was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies and 12 case reports were selected. ERT decreased uGAG levels (high evidence) and liver volume (high), improved 6-min walking test (6MWT) (moderate) and increased blood anti-ERT antibody levels (high). There was no conclusive results (low or very low evidence) regarding improvement/stabilization of respiratory function, change in shoulder flexion, cardiac improvement/stabilization, improvement in symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation and sleep apnea, improvement in quality of life, visual acuity, otolaryngologic function, bone mineral density or effectiveness of intrathecal therapy. LIMITATIONS: Excluding case reports, there was no study conducted specifically in the target population (ERT >=18years). Data were from subgroup analyses of selected studies. There was a great heterogeneity between designs and clinical outcomes evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: ERT improves uGAGs and liver volume in MPS-I patients initiating therapy as adults, although the putative clinical benefit associated to these improvements is unclear. Moderate evidence was shown for improvement in 6MWT. Systematic review registration number (PROSPERO): 42,016,041,306.
32439268	Neonatal combination therapy improves some of the clinical manifestations in the Mucopolysaccharidosis type I murine model.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme, results in the progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and consequent multiorgan dysfunction. Despite the effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in correcting clinical manifestations related to visceral organs, complete improvement of musculoskeletal and neurocognitive defects remains an unmet challenge and provides an impact on patients' quality of life. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining HSCT and ERT in the neonatal period. Using a mouse model of MPS-I, we demonstrated that the combination therapy improved clinical manifestations in organs usually refractory to current treatment. Moreover, combination with HSCT prevented the production of anti-IDUA antibodies that negatively impact ERT efficacy. The added benefits of combining both treatments also resulted in a reduction of skeletal anomalies and a trend towards decreased neuroinflammation and metabolic abnormalities. As currently there are limited therapeutic options for MPS-I patients, our findings suggest that the combination of HSCT and ERT during the neonatal period may provide a further step forward in the treatment of this rare disease.
31211405	Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (Aldurazyme ) for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified as three clinical sub-types; Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Scheie syndrome, with the scale of severity being such that Hurler syndrome is the most severe and Scheie syndrome the least severe. It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations are facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence. There are more attenuated variants termed Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with those affected potentially not presenting until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2013 and previously updated in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy as compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE via OVID and Embase.Date of most recent search: 30 January 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy compared to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the identified studies. The authors then appraised and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: One study (45 participants) met the inclusion criteria. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multinational study looked at laronidase at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg/week versus placebo in people with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. All primary outcomes listed in this review were studied in this study. The laronidase group achieved statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced vital capacity compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96) (low-quality evidence) and in the six-minute-walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the laronidase group; P = 0.039, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance) (low-quality evidence). The levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly reduced (low-quality evidence). In addition, there were improvements in hepatomegaly, sleep apnoea and hypopnoea. Laronidase antibodies were detected in nearly all participants in the treatment group with no apparent clinical effect and titres were reducing by the end of the study (very low-quality evidence). Infusion-related adverse reactions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated medical intervention or infusion cessation (low-quality evidence). As assessed by questionnaires,changes in a 'Disability Index' after treatment were small and did not differ between groups (low-quality evidence). There were no deaths in either group (low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrates that laronidase is effective when compared to placebo in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included study was comprehensive, with few participants and of low quality. The study included all of the key outcome measures we wished to look at. It demonstrated that laronidase is efficacious in relation to reducing biochemical parameters (reduced urine glycosaminoglycan excretion) and improved functional capacity as assessed by forced vital capacity and the six-minute-walk test. In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume. Laronidase appeared to be safe and, while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study. More studies are required to determine long-term effectiveness and safety and to assess the impact upon quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase can be used pre- and peri-haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment in those individuals diagnosed under 2.5 years of age. We do not anticipate any further trials to be undertaken and therefore do not plan to update this review.
39761695	Diffusion tensor imaging with free-water correction reveals distinctions between severe and attenuated subtypes in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder leading to deleterious brain effects. While animal models suggested that MPS I severely affects white matter (WM), whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis was not performed due to MPS-related morphological abnormalities. 3T DTI data from 28 severe (MPS IH, treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-HSCT), 16 attenuated MPS I patients (MPS IA) enrolled under the study protocol NCT01870375, and 27 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using the free-water correction (FWC) method to resolve macrostructural partial volume effects and unravel differences in DTI metrics accounting for microstructural abnormalities. FWC analysis in MPS IH compared to HC revealed higher free-water fraction (FWF) in all WM regions with increased radial (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD). Higher RD, MD, and FWF in cingulate and FWF in temporal WM were observed in MPS IA relative to HC. FWF and RD in the corpus callosum (CC) were higher in MPS IH than in MPS IA. Reaction time was correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in frontal and parietal WM in MPS IH. FA in temporal and central WM correlated with d-prime in MPS IA. The HSCT age was related to FA in parietal WM and FWF in frontal WM in MPS IH. FWC delineated subtype-specific WM microstructural abnormalities linked to myelination that were more extensive in MPS IH than IA, with CC findings being a key differentiator between subtypes. Earlier age at HSCT was related to preserved WM microstructure in the brain of MPS IH patients. Free water-corrected DTI distinguishes severe and attenuated MPS I patients and reveals a relationship between attention, age at HSCT, and white matter microstructure.
34788506	Hematopoietic Stem- and Progenitor-Cell Gene Therapy for Hurler Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the standard of care for Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Hurler variant [MPSIH]). However, this treatment is only partially curative and is associated with complications. METHODS: We are conducting an ongoing study involving eight children with MPSIH. At enrollment, the children lacked a suitable allogeneic donor and had a Developmental Quotient or Intelligence Quotient score above 70 (i.e., none had moderate or severe cognitive impairment). The children received autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with an alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)-encoding lentiviral vector after myeloablative conditioning. Safety and correction of blood IDUA activity up to supraphysiologic levels were the primary end points. Clearance of lysosomal storage material as well as skeletal and neurophysiological development were assessed as secondary and exploratory end points. The planned duration of the study is 5 years. RESULTS: We now report interim results. The children's mean (+-SD) age at the time of HSPC gene therapy was 1.9+-0.5 years. At a median follow-up of 2.10 years, the procedure had a safety profile similar to that known for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All the patients showed prompt and sustained engraftment of gene-corrected cells and had supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity within a month, which was maintained up to the latest follow-up. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion decreased steeply, reaching normal levels at 12 months in four of five patients who could be evaluated. Previously undetectable levels of IDUA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid became detectable after gene therapy and were associated with local clearance of GAGs. Patients showed stable cognitive performance, stable motor skills corresponding to continued motor development, improved or stable findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, reduced joint stiffness, and normal growth in line with World Health Organization growth charts. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of HSPC gene therapy in patients with MPSIH resulted in extensive metabolic correction in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system.

28054207	Mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I: the 30-year University of Minnesota experience.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mucopolysaccharidosis IH (MPS IH, Hurler syndrome) naturally leads to death within the first decade of life, primarily from cardiac and pulmonary causes. To determine how hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has altered mortality, we analyzed our institution's 30-year experience of patients with MPS IH undergoing HSCT. METHODS: Using chart review and the National Death Index, we determined survival status of 134 patients (males = 69) with MPS IH transplanted between 9/16/1983 and 7/25/2013 on 12/31/2013. Analysis included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curves, and regression analysis by Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Overall survival (95% CI) at one- and 25-years was 70% (62-78%) and 37% (19-55%), respectively. From 2004 onward, overall survival at one- and 8-years was 84% (73-96%) and 81% (69-94%), respectively, compared to 65% (55-74%) and 57% (47-67%) prior to 2004 (Log-rank p = 0.032). Regardless of era, male survival was significantly better than female (HR 0.40, [95% CI: 0.21-0.74], p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of death (95% CI) at 25 years was 63% (45-81%); incidence of pulmonary-related death was the highest at 27% (10-41%) compared to 8% (0.3-16%) for cardiac, 12% (6-17%) for infectious disease, and 16% (3-27%) from other complications. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT has increased survival in MPS IH beyond the third decade of life and decreased the incidence of cardiac mortality, but deaths after the third year post-HSCT occur in excess of expected US mortality. It is important to determine if improved transplant strategies since 2004 result in better long-term survival in the current patient population.
27450046	Deleterious effects of interruption followed by reintroduction of enzyme replacement therapy on a lysosomal storage disorder.	Temporary interruption of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with different lysosomal storage disorders may happen for different reasons (adverse reactions, issues with reimbursement, logistic difficulties, and so forth), and the impact of the interruption is still uncertain. In the present work, we studied the effects of the interruption of intravenous ERT (Laronidase, Genzyme) followed by its reintroduction in mice with the prototypical lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type I, comparing to mice receiving continuous treatment, untreated mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice, and normal mice. In the animals which treatment was temporarily interrupted, we observed clear benefits of treatment in several organs (liver, lung, heart, kidney, and testis) after reintroduction, but a worsening in the thickness of the aortic wall was detected. Furthermore, these mice had just partial improvements in behavioral tests, suggesting some deterioration in the brain function. Despite worsening is some disease aspects, urinary glycosaminoglycans levels did not increase during interruption, which indicates that this biomarker commonly used to monitor treatment in patients should not be used alone to assess treatment efficacy. The deterioration observed was not caused by the development of serum antienzyme antibodies. All together our results suggest that temporary ERT interruption leads to deterioration of function in some organs and should be avoided whenever possible.
34048802	Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I-Associated Corneal Disease: A Clinicopathologic Study.	PURPOSE: To report the anterior segment clinical features and histopathologic and histochemical characteristics of explanted corneas from the largest reported cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome and other variants of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I undergoing corneal transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: This institutional study reviewed 15 corneas from 9 patients with MPS I spectrum disease who underwent corneal transplant to treat corneal clouding between May 2011 and October 2020. We reviewed the clinical data, hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, and histochemical stains, including those for mucopolysaccharides (Alcian blue and/or colloidal iron). The main outcome measures were pathology observed under light microscopy and postsurgical clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent 15 corneal transplants for corneal clouding (14/15 procedures were deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty). All corneas had mucopolysaccharide deposition visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, which was highlighted in blue with histochemical stains. All corneas also showed alterations in Bowman's layer and the majority also showed epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSION: MPS I shows significant corneal clouding that is successfully treated with deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The excised corneas show characteristic epithelial changes, disruption or breaks in Bowman's membrane, and amphophilic collections of stromal granular mucopolysaccharides which are visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and highlighted by special histochemical stains (Alcian blue and collodial iron). These changes, although subtle, should alert the pathologist to the possibility of an underlying lysosomal storage disorder.
31332621	Obstructive sleep apnea and craniofacial appearance in MPS type I-Hurler children after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe multi-systemic organ manifestations including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice in severe MPS I (MPS IH, Hurler syndrome). However, the effect of HSCT on OSAS in MPS IH still remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze respiratory patterns during sleep following HSCT in MPS IH children and to relate these findings to craniofacial abnormalities. METHODS: Overnight polysomnographies of nine MPS IH children (mean age: 8.2 years) previously treated with HSCT were retrospectively analyzed. Magnetic resonance images of the head were assessed with regard to soft and hard tissue abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. RESULTS: The mean apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 5.3 events/h (range, 0.3-12.2), and the majority of apnea/hypopneas were obstructive. Whereas two patients had severe OSAS (AHI > 10) and two moderate OSAS (5 > AHI < 10), five patients had no evidence of OSAS (AHI < 2.0). Donor cell chimerism was significantly lower in MPS IH patients with OSAS as compared to patients without OSAS (p < 0.001). The upper airway space and the maxilla were significantly smaller and the adenoids larger in MPS IH patients with OSAS as compared to those of non-OSAS patients. CONCLUSION: OSAS was only observed in MPS IH patients with graft failure or low donor cell chimerism. Conversely, successful HSCT seems to ameliorate adenoid hyperplasia and maxillary constriction in MPS IH patients and thereby minimizes the risk of OSAS at least at younger ages.
30503158	Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe MPS I in the first six months of life: The heart of the matter.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is accepted therapy for severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS IH). With implementation of newborn screening (NBS) for MPS I in the US, HCT may now occur earlier than 1-2 years of age and it might be assumed that cardiac issues will be fewer. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our records for any MPS IH infant who underwent HCT at <=6 months of age. STUDY PATIENTS: Pre- and (most recent) post-HCT cardiac echos and clinical courses were reviewed in all infants with MPS IH undergoing HCT at <=6 months of age. RESULTS: 7 MPS IH infants (4 M) who were diagnosed at median (range) (MEDRNG) of 14 (3, 22) days of life (DOL) by NBS [2] or because an older sib had MPS IH [5], began enzyme replacement therapy at MEDRNG of 48 (7, 62) DOL. First pre-HCT echo was performed at MEDRNG of 45 (0, 88) DOL. HCT (6 cord blood, 1 related) occurred at MEDRNG of 131 (105, 183) DOL with most recent echo at MEDRNG of 408 (10, 1897) days after HCT. Mitral regurgitation (>=mild) occurred before (2/7) and after (2/7) HCT; LVH (2/7) occurred after HCT; PFO was common before (5/7) and after (3/7) HCT. One infant had severely decreased function at initial echo and required ICU management. Another infant with a patent foramen ovale and indwelling central line required additional neuroimaging to determine the cause of a seizure. A final infant died unexpectedly 69 days post-HCT without evidence of occlusive coronary disease at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the traditional phenotypic features of severe MPS I, newborns presenting for HCT have cardiac and non-cardiac problems unique to their young age. Recognition of these issues is essential for optimal outcomes.
28859139	Efficacy and safety of intravenous laronidase for mucopolysaccharidosis type I: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV laronidase for MPS I. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed by searching the ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library databases, limited to clinical trials published until December 31, 2016. The first inclusion criterion was being a randomized controlled trial (RCT). If < five RCTs were identified, open-label and nonrandomized trials, controlled or uncontrolled (quasi-experimental), including >= five patients, and evaluating relevant outcomes defined a priori, would also be included. For meta-analysis, primary inferences were based on random-effects models. Assessment of article quality was performed in accordance with the GRADE criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to examine the risk of bias for RCTs. RESULTS: The selection phase retrieved 632 articles. During the first phase of selection, 158 had the abstract or full text read for assessment of eligibility, of which nine (two RCTs) were included for qualitative synthesis. Four papers were included in the meta-analysis, which was performed for the following outcomes: occurrence of treatment-emergent or infusion-related adverse events (65%; 95%CI 53, 76), mild in most cases; development of IgG antibodies to laronidase (88%; 95%CI 67, 100); apnea-hypopnea index (not significant-NS), urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [mean change -65.5 mug/mg creatinine (95%CI -68.8, -62.3)], liver size [mean change -31.03% (95%CI -36.1, -25.9)], left ventricular mass index (LVMI) [mean change -1.8 (95%CI -2.32, -0.25)], and distance covered in the 6-minute walk test (NS). Among the outcomes not included in meta-analysis, we found evidence for benefit of laronidase only on shoulder flexion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that IV laronidase effectively reduces urinary GAGs excretion, hepatomegaly and LVMI, and can improve shoulder flexion in MPS I patients. Laronidase appears to be safe in the studied population.
31925897	Progressive eye pathology in mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice and effects of enzyme replacement therapy.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency, resulting in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Ophthalmological manifestations are common in MPS I patients and often lead to visual impairment. Accumulation of GAG in corneal or retinal tissues reduces vision causing corneal opacity and neurosensory complications. One available treatment for MPS I patients is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), but the results of such treatment on eye disease are still debatable. Therefore, we aimed to determine the progression of ocular manifestations as well as the effectiveness of intravenous ERT in MPS I. METHODS: Corneal and retinal analyses were perform in eyes from 2- to 8-month normal and MPS I mice. Some MPS I mice received ERT (1.2 mg/kg of laronidase) every 2 weeks from 6 to 8 months and histological findings were compared with controls. Additionally, cornea from two MPS I patients under ERT were evaluated. RESULTS: Mouse corneal tissues had GAG accumulation early in life. In the retina, we found a progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, starting at 6 months. ERT did not improve or stabilize the histological abnormalities. MPS I patients, despite being on ERT for over a decade, presented GAG accumulation in the cornea, corneal thickening, visual loss and needed corneal transplantation. CONCLUSION: We provide data on the time course of ocular alteration in MPS I mice. Our results also suggest that ERT is not effective in treating the progressive ocular manifestations in MPS I mice and fails to prevent corneal abnormalities in patients.
34189746	Mucopolysaccharidoses type I gene therapy.	Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by a malfunction of the alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme leading to the storage of glycosaminoglycans in the lysosomes. This disease has longtime been studied as a therapeutic target for those studying gene therapy and many studies have been done using various vectors to deliver the IDUA gene for corrective treatment. Many vectors have difficulties with efficacy and insertional mutagenesis concerns including adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Studies of AAV vectors treating MPS I have seemed promising, but recent deaths in gene therapy clinical trials for other inherited diseases using AAV vectors have left questions about their safety. Additionally, the recent modifications to adenoviral vectors leading them to target the vascular endothelium minimizing the risk of hepatotoxicity could lead to them being a viable option for MPS I gene therapy when coupled with gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9.
33139350	Improvement in time to treatment, but not time to diagnosis, in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis and treatment initiation are important factors for successful treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). The purpose of this observational study was to assess whether age at diagnosis and time to first treatment for individuals with MPS I have improved over the last 15 years. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the MPS I Registry (NCT00144794) for individuals with attenuated or severe disease who initiated therapy with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2017 were included. RESULTS: Data were available for 740 individuals with attenuated (n=291) or severe (n=424) MPS I (unknown n=25). Median age at diagnosis for attenuated disease did not change over time and ranged between 4.5 and 6 years of age while the median duration from diagnosis to first ERT decreased from 5.6 years before/during 2004 to 2.4 months in 2014-2017. For severe MPS I treated with HSCT, median age at diagnosis was less than 1 year and median time to first treatment was less than 3 months throughout the 15-year observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Times to diagnosis and HSCT initiation for individuals with severe MPS I were consistent over time. For individuals with attenuated MPS I, the time to ERT initiation after diagnosis has improved substantially in the last 15 years, but median age at diagnosis has not improved. Efforts to improve early diagnosis in attenuated MPS I are needed to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment at the optimal time.
29198892	RTB lectin-mediated delivery of lysosomal alpha-l-iduronidase mitigates disease manifestations systemically including the central nervous system.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal disease resulting from deficiency in the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) hydrolase and subsequent accumulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Clinically, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with IDUA achieves negligible neurological benefits presumably due to blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limitations. To investigate the plant lectin ricin B chain (RTB) as a novel carrier for enzyme delivery to the brain, an IDUA:RTB fusion protein (IDUAL), produced in N. benthamiana leaves, was tested in a murine model of Hurler syndrome (MPS I). Affect mice (n=3 for each group) were intravenously injected with a single dose of IDUAL (0.58, 2 or 5.8mgIDUAequivalents/kg) and analyzed after 24h. IDUA activities in liver, kidney and spleen increased significantly, and liver GAG levels were significantly reduced in all three groups. Plasma IDUA levels for all treated groups were high at 1h after injection and decreased by 95% at 4h, indicating efficient distribution into tissues. For long-term evaluations, IDUAL (0.58 or 2mg/kg, 8 weekly injections) was intravenously injected into MPS I mice (n=12 for each group). Thirteen days after the 8th injection, significant IDUA activity was detected in the liver and spleen. GAG levels in tissues including the brain cortex and cerebellum were significantly reduced in treated animals. Treated MPS I mice also showed significant improvement in neurocognitive testing. ELISA results showed that while there was a significant antibody response against IDUAL and plant-derived IDUA, there was no significant antibody response to RTB. No major toxicity or adverse events were observed. Together, these results showed that infusion of IDUAL allowed for significant IDUA levels and GAG reduction in the brain and subsequent neurological benefits. This RTB-mediated delivery may have significant implications for therapeutic protein delivery impacting a broad spectrum of lysosomal, and potentially neurological diseases.
33517895	Long term disease burden post-transplantation: three decades of observations in 25 Hurler patients successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPSI-H) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe physical symptoms and cognitive decline. Early treatment with hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) is critical to the survival of these patients. While survival rates and short-term outcomes are known to be improved by HSCT, the long-term cognitive, adaptive and psychosocial functional outcomes of children with (MPSI-H) post-HSCT are not well documented. This manuscript focuses on retrospective long-term follow-up (7-33 years) of 25 MPSI-H patients, transplanted between 1986 and 2011. RESULTS: The median age at transplantation was 21 months (range 12-57 months). Except for one death, all successfully transplanted MPSI-H patients surviving at least 1 year after HSCT are alive to-date, with a median age of 21 years (range 8-36 years) at the last follow-up evaluation. A majority of HSCT grafts were bone marrow transplants (BMT), resulting in durable full chimerism in 18 (72%). Pre-HSCT, the onset of first symptoms occurred very early, at a median age of 3 months (range birth-16 months). The most prevalent symptoms before MPSI-H diagnosis involved progressive dysostosis multiplex; almost all patients suffered from hip dysplasia and thoracolumbar spine Kyphosis. Despite HSCT, considerable residual disease burden and ensuing corrective surgical interventions were observed in all, and at every decade of follow-up post HSCT. Late-onset psychiatric manifestations were significant (n = 17 patients; 68%), including depression in 13 patients at a median onset age of 18 years (range 13-31 years), hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder (n = 4), and multiple acute psychotic episodes (APE), independent of depression observed (n = 3) at a median onset age of 18 years (range 17-31 years). The adult Welscher Intelligence Scale results (n = 16) were heterogenous across the four scale dimensions; overall lower scores were observed on both working memory index (median WMI = 69.5) and processing speed index (median PSI = 65), whereas verbal comprehension index (median VCI = 79) and perceptual reasoning index (median PRI = 74) were higher. CONCLUSION: With advanced treatment options, MPSI-H are living into 3rd and 4th decades of life, however not disease free and with poor adaptation. Residual disease (loss of mobility, limited gross and fine motor skills; low cognitive ability; suboptimal cardiopulmonary function, vision and hearing) negatively impacts the quality of life and psychosocial functioning of affected individuals.
27033167	Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (Aldurazyme( )) for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I.	BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified as three clinical sub-types; Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Scheie syndrome, with the scale of severity being such that Hurler syndrome is the most severe and Scheie syndrome the least severe. It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations are facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence. There are more attenuated variants termed Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with those affected potentially not presenting until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy as compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE via OVID and Embase.Date of most recent search: 05 October 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy compared to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the identified studies. The authors then appraised and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: One study of 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multinational study looked at laronidase at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg/week versus placebo in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. All primary outcomes listed in this review were studied in this study. The laronidase group achieved statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced vital capacity compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96) and in the six-minute-walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the laronidase group; P = 0.039, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance). The levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly reduced. In addition, there were improvements in hepatomegaly, sleep apnoea and hypopnoea. Laronidase antibodies were detected in nearly all patients in the treatment group with no apparent clinical effect and titres were reducing by the end of the study. Infusion-related adverse reactions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated medical intervention or infusion cessation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrates that laronidase is effective when compared to placebo in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included study was comprehensive and of good quality, although there were few participants. The study included all of the key outcome measures we wished to look at. It demonstrated that laronidase is efficacious in relation to reducing biochemical parameters (reduced urine glycosaminoglycan excretion) and improved functional capacity as assessed by forced vital capacity and the six-minute-walk test. In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume. Laronidase appeared to be safe and, while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study. More studies are required to determine long-term effectiveness and safety and to assess the impact upon quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase can be used pre- and peri-haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment in those patients diagnosed under 2.5 years of age.
38897489	Laronidase-loaded liposomes reach the brain and other hard-to-treat organs after noninvasive nasal administration.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by lack of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), responsible for the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan and heparan sulfate, leading to multisystemic signs and symptoms. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment that consists of weekly intravenous administrations of laronidase, a recombinant version of IDUA. However, ERT have limited access to certain tissues, such as bone, cartilage, and brain, and laronidase fails to trespass the BBB. In this sense, this study reports the development and characterization of laronidase-loaded liposomes for the treatment of MPS I mice. Liposomal complexes were obtained by the thin film formation method followed by microfluidization. The main characterization results showed vesicle size of 103.0 +- 3.3 nm, monodisperse populations of vesicles, zeta potential around + 30.0 +- 2.1 mV, and mucoadhesion strength of 5.69 +- 0.14 mN. Treatment of MPS I mouse fibroblasts showed significant increase in enzyme activity. Nasal administration of complexes to MPS I mice resulted in significant increase in laronidase activity in the brain cortex, heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and serum. The overall results demonstrate the feasibility of nasal administration of laronidase-loaded liposomes to deliver enzyme in difficult-to-reach tissues, circumventing ERT issues and bringing hope as a potential treatment for MPS I.
27228099	Targeted Polymeric Nanoparticles for Brain Delivery of High Molecular Weight Molecules in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.	Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a group of metabolic syndromes, each one due to the deficit of one lysosomal enzyme. Many LSDs affect most of the organ systems and overall about 75% of the patients present neurological impairment. Enzyme Replacement Therapy, although determining some systemic clinical improvements, is ineffective on the CNS disease, due to enzymes' inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). With the aim to deliver the therapeutic enzymes across the BBB, we here assayed biodegradable and biocompatible PLGA-nanoparticles (NPs) in two murine models for LSDs, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I and II (MPS I and MPS II). PLGA-NPs were modified with a 7-aminoacid glycopeptide (g7), yet demonstrated to be able to deliver low molecular weight (MW) molecules across the BBB in rodents. We specifically investigated, for the first time, the g7-NPs ability to transfer a model drug (FITC-albumin) with a high MW, comparable to the enzymes to be delivered for LSDs brain therapy. In vivo experiments, conducted on wild-type mice and knockout mouse models for MPS I and II, also included a whole series of control injections to obtain a broad preliminary view of the procedure efficiency. Results clearly showed efficient BBB crossing of albumin in all injected mice, underlying the ability of NPs to deliver high MW molecules to the brain. These results encourage successful experiments with enzyme-loaded g7-NPs to deliver sufficient amounts of the drug to the brain district on LSDs, where exerting a corrective effect on the pathological phenotype. 
33572941	Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: Current Treatments, Limitations, and Prospects for Improvement.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal disease, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). IDUA catalyzes the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate (DS and HS, respectively). Lack of the enzyme leads to pathologic accumulation of undegraded HS and DS with subsequent disease manifestations in multiple organs. The disease can be divided into severe (Hurler syndrome) and attenuated (Hurler-Scheie, Scheie) forms. Currently approved treatments consist of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with attenuated disease are often treated with ERT alone, while the recommended therapy for patients with Hurler syndrome consists of HSCT. While these treatments significantly improve disease manifestations and prolong life, a considerable burden of disease remains. Notably, treatment can partially prevent, but not significantly improve, clinical manifestations, necessitating early diagnosis of disease and commencement of treatment. This review discusses these standard therapies and their impact on common disease manifestations in patients with MPS I. Where relevant, results of animal models of MPS I will be included. Finally, we highlight alternative and emerging treatments for the most common disease manifestations.
32610100	miR-143 Regulates Lysosomal Enzyme Transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier and Transforms CNS Treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.	During brain maturation, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), a key transporter for lysosomal hydrolases, decreases significantly on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Such a phenomenon leads to poor brain penetration of therapeutic enzymes and subsequent failure in reversing neurological complications in patients with neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases (nLSDs), such as Hurler syndrome (severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I [MPS I]). In this study, we discover that upregulation of microRNA-143 (miR-143) contributes to the decline of CI-MPR on the BBB during development. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-143 inhibits CI-MPR expression and its transport function in human endothelial cells in vitro. Genetic removal of miR-143 in MPS I mice enhances CI-MPR expression and improves enzyme transport across the BBB, leading to brain metabolic correction, pathology normalization, and correction of neurological functional deficits 5 months after peripheral protein delivery at clinically relevant levels that derived from erythroid/megakaryocytic cells via hematopoietic stem cell-mediated gene therapy, when otherwise no improvement was observed in MPS I mice at a parallel setting. These studies not only uncover a novel role of miR-143 as an important modulator for the developmental decline of CI-MPR on the BBB, but they also demonstrate the functional significance of depleting miR-143 for "rescuing" BBB-anchored CI-MPR on advancing CNS treatment for nLSDs.
28462595	Intranasal Adeno-Associated Virus Mediated Gene Delivery and Expression of Human Iduronidase in the Central Nervous System: A Noninvasive and Effective Approach for Prevention of Neurologic Disease in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive, multi-systemic, inherited metabolic disease caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Current treatments for this disease are ineffective in treating central nervous system (CNS) disease due to the inability of lysosomal enzymes to traverse the blood-brain barrier. A noninvasive and effective approach was taken in the treatment of CNS disease by intranasal administration of an IDUA-encoding adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector. Adult IDUA-deficient mice aged 3 months were instilled intranasally with AAV9-IDUA vector. Animals sacrificed 5 months post instillation exhibited IDUA enzyme activity levels that were up to 50-fold that of wild-type mice in the olfactory bulb, with wild-type levels of enzyme restored in all other parts of the brain. Intranasal treatment with AAV9-IDUA also resulted in the reduction of tissue glycosaminoglycan storage materials in the brain. There was strong IDUA immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections observed in the nasal epithelium and olfactory bulb, but there was no evidence of the presence of transduced cells in other portions of the brain. This indicates that reduction of storage materials most likely occurred as a result of enzyme diffusion from the olfactory bulb and the nasal epithelium into deeper areas of the brain. At 8 months of age, neurocognitive testing using the Barnes maze to assess spatial navigation demonstrated that treated IDUA-deficient mice were no different from normal control animals, while untreated IDUA-deficient mice exhibited significant learning and navigation deficits. This novel, noninvasive strategy for intranasal AAV9-IDUA instillation could potentially be used to treat CNS manifestations of human MPS I.
34480380	MPS I: Early diagnosis, bone disease and treatment, where are we now?	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency. Patients present with a broad spectrum of disease severity ranging from the most severe phenotype (Hurler) with devastating neurocognitive decline, bone disease and early death to intermediate (Hurler-Scheie) and more attenuated (Scheie) phenotypes, with a normal life expectancy. The most severely affected patients are preferably treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which halts the neurocognitive decline. Patients with more attenuated phenotypes are treated with enzyme replacement therapy. There are several challenges to be met in the treatment of MPS I patients. First, to optimize outcome, early recognition of the disease and clinical phenotype is needed to guide decisions on therapeutic strategies. Second, there is thus far no effective treatment available for MPS I bone disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind bone disease are largely unknown, limiting the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This article is a state of the art that comprehensively discusses three of the most urgent open issues in MPS I: early diagnosis of MPS I patients, pathophysiology of MPS I bone disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies for MPS I bone disease.
37543633	Mapping brain networks in MPS I mice and their restoration following gene therapy.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal disorder that causes syndromes characterized by physiological dysfunction in many organs and tissues. Despite the recognizable morphological and behavioral deficits associated with MPS I, neither the underlying alterations in functional neural connectivity nor its restoration following gene therapy have been shown. By employing high-resolution resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we found significant reductions in functional neural connectivity in the limbic areas of the brain that play key roles in learning and memory in MPS I mice, and that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy can reestablish most brain connectivity. Using logistic regression in MPS I and treated animals, we identified functional networks with the most alterations. The rs-fMRI and statistical methods should be translatable into clinical evaluation of humans with neurological disorders.
31017018	Safe and Sustained Expression of Human Iduronidase After Intrathecal Administration of Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 9 in Infant Rhesus Monkeys.	Many neuropathic diseases cause early, irreversible neurologic deterioration, which warrants therapeutic intervention during the first months of life. In the case of mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), one of the most promising treatment approaches is to restore enzyme expression through gene therapy. Specifically, administering pantropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding IDUA into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via suboccipital administration has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in large animals. Preclinical safety studies conducted in adult nonhuman primates supported a positive risk-benefit profile of the procedure while highlighting potential subclinical toxicity to primary sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This study investigated the long-term performance of intrathecal cervical AAV serotype 9 gene transfer of human IDUA administered to 1-month-old rhesus monkeys (N = 4) with half of the animals tolerized to the human transgene at birth via systemic administration of an AAV serotype 8 vector expressing human IDUA from the liver. Sustained expression of the transgene for almost 4 years is reported in all animals. Transduced cells were primarily pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lower motor neurons, and DRG neurons. Both tolerized and non-tolerized animals were robust and maintained transgene expression as measured by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue. However, the presence of antibodies in the non-tolerized animals led to a loss of measurable levels of secreted enzyme in the CSF. These results support the safety and efficiency of treating neonatal rhesus monkeys with AAV serotype 9 gene therapy delivered into the CSF.

33314581	Thalidomide as treatment of crohn-like disease occurred after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a pediatric patient.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases may occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD or Crohn disease) is rarely described. We describe a child who developed CD after allo-HSCT, successfully treated with thalidomide. CASE REPORT: A child affected by mucopolysaccharidosis type I received two allogeneic HSCTs for rejection after the first one. After cutaneous and intestinal chronic GvHD and 6 months after HSCT, the patients developed a trilinear autoimmune cytopenia successfully treated with rituximab and sirolimus. Due to persisting intestinal symptoms, colonoscopies were performed and histological findings demonstrated a picture of CD. Based on this observation and according to the recommendations for the treatment of CD, thalidomide was started. A complete stable clinical response was obtained 8 weeks after start of thalidomide. Colonoscopy performed 4.8 years later demonstrated a complete endoscopic and histological remission of CD. DISCUSSION: In this case, the diagnosis of CD after HSCT was based on histological findings. Indeed, repeated colonscopies were necessary for diagnosis, since both clinical and endoscopic features are often common to chronic GvHD and CD. Thalidomide was started at the dose of 1.7 mg/Kg/day, and it was well tolerated. Mild peripheral neurotoxicity occurred 5 years later but disappeared completely with the dose reduction. Currently, the patient is in complete remission from CD, despite the discontinuation of all the immunosuppressive therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide could represent a therapeutic option to treat CD as autoimmune disease after allogeneic HSCT.
28560469	Gene therapy for lysosomal storage disorders: recent advances for metachromatic leukodystrophy and mucopolysaccaridosis I.	Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic disorders characterized by a dysfunction in lysosomes, leading to waste material accumulation and severe organ damage. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have been exploited as potential treatments for LSDs but pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown in some cases limited efficacy. Intravenous ERT is able to control the damage of visceral organs but cannot prevent nervous impairment. Depending on the disease type, HSCT has important limitations when performed for early variants, unless treatment occurs before disease onset. In the attempt to overcome these issues, gene therapy has been proposed as a valuable therapeutic option, either ex vivo, with target cells genetically modified in vitro, or in vivo, by inserting the genetic material with systemic or intra-parenchymal, in situ administration. In particular, the use of autologous haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced with a viral vector containing a healthy copy of the mutated gene would allow supra-normal production of the defective enzyme and cross correction of target cells in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system. This review will provide an overview of the most recent scientific advances in HSC-based gene therapy approaches for the treatment of LSDs with particular focus on metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I).
32781600	Lower Exposure to Busulfan Allows for Stable Engraftment of Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Children with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: A Case Report of Four Patients.	Busulfan is an alkylating agent routinely used in conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for various nonmalignant disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism. The combination of model-based dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of busulfan pharmacokinetics (PK) to a lower exposure target has the potential to reduce the regimen-related toxicity while opening marrow niches sufficient for engraftment in diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). We present four cases of the severe form of MPS I or Hurler syndrome, demonstrating successful and stable CD14/15 donor chimerism following the prospective application of model-based dosing and TDM aimed to achieve lower busulfan exposure. All patients received a busulfan-based conditioning regimen with a median cumulative area-under-the-curve (cAUC) target of 63.7 mg h/L (range, 62.4 to 65.0) in protocol-specific combination of chemotherapeutic regimen. The donor source was unrelated umbilical cord blood for three patients and matched sibling donor bone marrow for one patient. The observed median busulfan cAUC was 66.1 mg h/L (range, 65.2 to 70.6) and was within 10% of the intended target. Stable, full donor myeloid chimerism was achieved for three patients, while one patient achieved a stable mixed chimerism (76% donor CD14/15 at 53 months) without a recurring need for enzyme replacement. The normalization of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme levels followed the attainment of successful donor myeloid chimerism in all patients. Regimen-related toxicity remained low with no evidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and chronic GVHD.
27064989	Pentosan Polysulfate: Oral Versus Subcutaneous Injection in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Dogs.	BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of pentosan polysulfate (PPS) in a rat model of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VI. Reduction of inflammation, reduction of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage, and improvement in the skeletal phenotype were shown. Herein, we evaluate the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, MPS I dogs. We focused on the arterial phenotype since this is one of the most consistent and clinically significant features of the model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MPS I dogs were treated with daily oral or biweekly subcutaneous (subQ) PPS at a human equivalent dose of 1.6 mg/kg for 17 and 12 months, respectively. Safety parameters were assessed at 6 months and at the end of the study. Following treatment, cytokine and GAG levels were determined in fluids and tissues. Assessments of the aorta and carotid arteries also were performed. No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factors, or other adverse effects were observed. Significantly reduced IL-8 and TNF-alpha were found in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GAG reduction was observed in urine and tissues. Increases in the luminal openings and reduction of the intimal media thickening occurred in the carotids and aortas of PPS-treated animals, along with a reduction of storage vacuoles. These results were correlated with a reduction of GAG storage, reduction of clusterin 1 staining, and improved elastin integrity. No significant changes in the spines of the treated animals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PPS treatment led to reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and GAG storage in urine and tissues of MPS I dogs, which were most evident after subQ administration. SubQ administration also led to significant cytokine reductions in the CSF. Both treatment groups exhibited markedly reduced carotid and aortic inflammation, increased vessel integrity, and improved histopathology. We conclude that PPS may be a safe and useful therapy for MPS I, either as an adjunct or as a stand-alone treatment that reduces inflammation and GAG storage.
26935461	Progression of Hip Dysplasia in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Hurler After Successful Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Dysostosis multiplex contributes substantially to morbidity in patients with Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I Hurler phenotype [MPS I-H]), even after successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). One of the hallmarks of dysostosis multiplex in MPS I-H is hip dysplasia, which often requires surgical intervention. We sought to describe in detail the course of hip dysplasia in this group of patients, as assessed by radiographic analysis, and to identify potential outcome predictors. METHODS: Longitudinal data were obtained from digitally scored pelvic radiographs of patients with MPS I-H using OrthoGon software for parameters including, but not limited to, the acetabular index, migration percentage, Smith ratio, and neck-shaft angle. Scoring was performed independently by two blinded observers. Additional information on genotype, enzyme replacement therapy pre-HSCT, donor chimerism, and enzyme activity post-HSCT were obtained. General trends and potential correlations were calculated with mixed-model statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (192 radiographs) were included in this analysis. Intraobserver and interobserver variation analysis showed an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 1.00. Among the twenty-one patients with follow-up beyond the age of five years, the acetabular index was in the range of severe hip dysplasia in up to 86% of the patients. Severe coxa valga was seen in 91% of the patients. Lateral and superior femoral displacement were highly prevalent, with the migration percentage outside the reference range in up to 96% of the patients. Finally, anterior pelvic tilt increased with age (p = 0.001). No correlations were identified between clinical parameters and radiographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that progressive acetabular dysplasia as well as coxa valga and hip displacement are highly prevalent and progressive over time in patients with MPS I-H, despite successful HSCT. These data may provide essential natural history determinations for the assessment of efficacy of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving skeletal outcomes in patients with MPS I-H.
37891668	Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.	BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme ) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme ) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as "good" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy.
