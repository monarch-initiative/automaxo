input_text: 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Mucopolysaccharidosis I in the
  presence of decreased cardiac function. BACKGROUND: Severe mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I, (MPS IH) is a rare inherited lysosomal disorder resulting in progressive
  storage of proteoglycans (GAGs) in central nervous system and somatic tissues and,
  if left untreated, causing death within the first decade of life. Hematopoietic
  cell transplantation (HCT) arrests many of the features of MPS IH but carries a
  10-15% risk of mortality. Decreased cardiac function can occur in MPS IH and increase
  the risk of HCT. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed to determine
  the long-term outcome of individuals evaluated for HCT with MPS IH who had decreased
  cardiac function as measured by cardiac echocardiogram (echo) and ejection fraction
  (EF) of <50% at the time of initial evaluation. RESULTS: Six patients ranging in
  age from 1 week to 21 months (median: 4 months) had EFs ranging from 25 to 47% (median:
  32%) at diagnosis and were initiated on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with improvement
  in EF in three patients by 5 months. The remaining three patients continued to have
  EFs <50% and continuous milrinone infusion was added in the pre-HCT period. On average,
  milrinone infusion was able to be discontinued post-HCT, prior to hospital discharge,
  within a mean of 37 days. Five patients survived HCT and are alive today with normal
  EFs. One patient receiving milrinone died of sepsis during HCT with a normal EF.
  CONCLUSION: Decreased cardiac systolic function in infants with MPS IH that fails
  to normalize with ERT alone may benefit from the addition of continuous milrinone
  infusion during HCT.'
