input_text: 'Long-term outcomes of systemic therapies for Hurler syndrome: an international
  multicenter comparison. PURPOSE: Early treatment is critical for mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I), justifying its incorporation into newborn screening. Enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) treats MPS I, yet presumptions that ERT cannot penetrate the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) support recommendations that hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
  treat the severe, neurodegenerative form (Hurler syndrome). Ethics precludes randomized
  comparison of ERT with HCT, but insight into this comparison is presented with an
  international cohort of patients with Hurler syndrome who received long-term ERT
  from a young age. METHODS: Long-term survival and neurologic outcomes were compared
  among three groups of patients with Hurler syndrome: 18 treated with ERT monotherapy
  (ERT group), 54 who underwent HCT (HCT group), and 23 who received no therapy (Untreated).
  All were followed starting before age 5 years. A sensitivity analysis restricted
  age of treatment below 3 years. RESULTS: Survival was worse when comparing ERT versus
  HCT, and Untreated versus ERT. The cumulative incidences of hydrocephalus and cervical
  spinal cord compression were greater in ERT versus HCT. Findings persisted in the
  sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: As newborn screening widens treatment opportunity
  for Hurler syndrome, this examination of early treatment quantifies some ERT benefit,
  supports presumptions about BBB impenetrability, and aligns with current guidelines
  to treat with HCT.'
