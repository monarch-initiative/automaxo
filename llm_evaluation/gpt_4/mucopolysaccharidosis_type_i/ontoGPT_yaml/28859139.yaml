input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of intravenous laronidase for mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of IV laronidase for MPS I. METHODS: A systematic literature review was
  performed by searching the ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, and
  Cochrane Library databases, limited to clinical trials published until December
  31, 2016. The first inclusion criterion was being a randomized controlled trial
  (RCT). If < five RCTs were identified, open-label and nonrandomized trials, controlled
  or uncontrolled (quasi-experimental), including >= five patients, and evaluating
  relevant outcomes defined a priori, would also be included. For meta-analysis, primary
  inferences were based on random-effects models. Assessment of article quality was
  performed in accordance with the GRADE criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
  was used to examine the risk of bias for RCTs. RESULTS: The selection phase retrieved
  632 articles. During the first phase of selection, 158 had the abstract or full
  text read for assessment of eligibility, of which nine (two RCTs) were included
  for qualitative synthesis. Four papers were included in the meta-analysis, which
  was performed for the following outcomes: occurrence of treatment-emergent or infusion-related
  adverse events (65%; 95%CI 53, 76), mild in most cases; development of IgG antibodies
  to laronidase (88%; 95%CI 67, 100); apnea-hypopnea index (not significant-NS), urinary
  glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [mean change -65.5 mug/mg creatinine (95%CI -68.8, -62.3)],
  liver size [mean change -31.03% (95%CI -36.1, -25.9)], left ventricular mass index
  (LVMI) [mean change -1.8 (95%CI -2.32, -0.25)], and distance covered in the 6-minute
  walk test (NS). Among the outcomes not included in meta-analysis, we found evidence
  for benefit of laronidase only on shoulder flexion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
  that IV laronidase effectively reduces urinary GAGs excretion, hepatomegaly and
  LVMI, and can improve shoulder flexion in MPS I patients. Laronidase appears to
  be safe in the studied population.'
