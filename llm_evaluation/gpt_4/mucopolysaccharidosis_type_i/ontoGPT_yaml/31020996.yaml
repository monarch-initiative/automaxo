input_text: Limited data to evaluate real-world effectiveness of enzyme replacement
  therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are often
  authorized based on pivotal phase II and III trials that do not always meet high
  quality criteria. Laronidase is an example of an OMP used for treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis
  I (MPS I). One randomized controlled trial demonstrated efficacy on several somatic
  symptoms. However, effectiveness in the real-world setting remains to be determined.
  We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) on clinically relevant outcomes in MPS I. A search in OVID MEDLINE
  and OVID EMBASE was performed. Postmarketing studies including MPS I patients treated
  with ERT and reporting data on any of 19 predefined clinical outcome measures obtained
  before the start of ERT and at follow-up were eligible. Three scenarios were used
  to define effectiveness of ERT. The first scenario (A) assumes that improvement
  is essential, while the second scenario (B) also includes stabilization of signs
  and symptoms. The third scenario (C) defines failure of therapy. Twenty case series
  were included. The criteria indicating effectiveness (A), were met for four of 19
  outcome measures while the criteria, indicating unclear effectiveness (B) were met
  for five of 19. For one of 19 nonverifiable data were reported and for nine of 19
  no overall conclusions could be drawn (ambiguous results). Real-world effectiveness
  of laronidase is extremely difficult to assess, 15 years after marketing authorization.
  This is partially due to insufficient natural history data. We recommend the conduct
  of rigorous and independent postmarketing studies including core outcome sets for
  OMPs, enforced by marketing and/or reimbursing authorities aiming to demonstrate
  real-world effectiveness within a reasonable time frame.
