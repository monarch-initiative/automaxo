input_text: 'Growth in individuals with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I during
  untreated and treated periods: Data from the MPS I registry. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I (MPS I) is caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Short stature and
  growth deceleration are common in individuals with the attenuated MPS I phenotype.
  Study objectives were to assess growth in individuals with attenuated MPS I enrolled
  in The MPS I Registry while untreated and after initiation of enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) with laronidase (recombinant human iduronidase). Individuals in the
  MPS I Registry with at least one observation for height and assigned attenuated
  MPS I phenotype as of September 2020 were included. The cohort included 142 males
  and 153 females 2-18 years of age. Age and sex adjusted standardized height-for-age
  z-scores during the natural history and ERT-treatment periods were assessed using
  linear mixed model repeated measures analyses. Growth curves were estimated during
  both periods and compared to standard growth charts from the Center for Disease
  Control (CDC). There was a significantly slower decline in height z-scores with
  age during the ERT-treated period compared to the natural history period. Estimated
  average height z-scores in the ERT-treatment versus the natural history period at
  age 10 were -2.4 versus -3.3 in females and -1.4 versus -2.9 in males (females first
  treated 3 year; males <4.1 year). While median height remained below CDC standards
  during both the natural history and ERT-treated periods for individuals with attenuated
  MPS I, laronidase ERT was associated with slower declines in height z-scores.'
