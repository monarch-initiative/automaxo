input_text: 'Short and Long-Term Outcomes of Liver Transplantation in Pediatric Patients
  With Inborn Errors of Metabolism: A Single-Center Study. BACKGROUND: Inborn errors
  of metabolism (IEMs) are inherited diseases causing significant morbidity and mortality,
  particularly in childhood. Liver transplantation (LT) can be curative or partially
  effective for these diseases. LT for IEMs has increased, making IEMs the second
  most common reason for pediatric LT after biliary atresia. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
  Between 2001 and 2023, 50 pediatric patients with IEMs underwent LT at Baskent University,
  Ankara Hospital. Data collected retrospectively included diagnosis, gender, age
  of diagnosis, age of LT, LT indication, donor data, graft type, rejection episodes,
  post-transplant complications, and clinical findings of the IEMs before and after
  LT. Treatment methods, follow-up duration, and survival time were also recorded.
  RESULTS: Of the 332 pediatric LT patients, 50 (15.1%) had IEMs, with three requiring
  re-transplantations. Diagnoses included glycogen storage diseases (n = 11), tyrosinemia
  type 1 (n = 10), primary hyperoxaluria (n = 6), urea cycle disorders (n = 6), homozygous
  familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 4), propionic acidemia (n = 4), deoxyguanosine
  kinase deficiency (n = 3), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), methylmalonic acidemia
  (n = 1), Niemann-Pick disease type B (n = 1), alkaptonuria with unknown neonatal
  cholestasis (n = 1), and bile acid synthesis disorder (n = 1). The parental consanguinity
  rate was 74%. Living-related donors provided organs for 48 (90.5%) patients. The
  mean age at LT was 75.3 +- 8.2 months (range: 5-218), with a follow-up period of
  82.1 +- 10.2 months (range:1 day-229 months). Survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 15
  years were 83.7%, 81%, 81%, and 70.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: LT is an effective
  solution for children with IEM causing chronic organ failure and difficult to manage
  with medical treatment, showing a good long-term prognosis.'
