input_text: "Efficacy and safety of intermittent hemodialysis in infants and young
  children with inborn errors of metabolism. BACKGROUND: Intermittent hemodialysis
  (IHD) is the most efficient form of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for removing
  toxic substances from patients' bodies. However, the efficacy and safety of IHD
  in infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism are still not clear.
  METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with urea cycle disorders, maple
  syrup urine disease, and methylmalonic acidemia who received IHD or non-IHD RRT
  at our hospital between 2001 and 2012 to remove ammonia, leucine, or methylmalonic
  acid. Both the efficacy and safety of the RRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five
  courses of RRT, including 25 courses of IHD and ten courses of non-IHD RRT, for
  15 patients were included in the analysis. Before 2006, non-IHD RRT procedures,
  including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH),
  were the most often used; from 2006 onwards IHD was used. There was one procedure-unrelated
  death. Catheter penetration occurred in one course of IHD. The efficacy data revealed
  that both the median duration of dialysis and the median 50 % toxin reduction time
  were shorter in IHD than in non-IHD RRT. CONCLUSIONS: In infants and young children
  with inborn errors of metabolism, IHD is safe and more efficient than non-IHD RRT
  at removing toxins."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
