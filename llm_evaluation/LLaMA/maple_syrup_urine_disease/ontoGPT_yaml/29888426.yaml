input_text: Differential response to renal replacement therapy in neonatal-onset inborn
  errors of metabolism. Severe urea cycle defects (UCD), organic acidemias (OA) and
  maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are life-threatening disorders presenting in the
  first days of life. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an emergency option in affected
  newborns, mostly performed as ultima ratio. We report our 10-year experience using
  emergency RRT in newborns with UCD, OA and MSUD. Twelve newborns (eight with UCD,
  two with methylmalonic acidemia and two with MSUD) underwent emergency RRT. The
  overall survival rate to RRT was 58.3%. Hyperammonemic newborns required earlier
  RRT with respect to MSUD patients (75 (65-102) vs 301 (192-410) h of life, P < 0.01).
  Hyperammonemic neonates surviving (n = 5) and non-surviving (n = 5) the acute neonatal
  decompensation showed similar birth weight (P = 0.690), duration of intubation (P
  = 0.917), ammonia at onset (P = 0.916) and at the start of RRT (P = 0.426), age
  at RRT (P = 0.999) and duration of coma before RRT (P = 0.691). Remarkably, all
  survivors quickly responded to RRT, with ammonia concentration less than 300 mumol/L
  after 8 h of treatment. One patient with UCD successfully treated by neonatal RRT
  died at 4 months of life because of sepsis. All patients with MSUD had normalized
  leucine levels after 12 h of RRT, surviving the acute neonatal decompenstation.
  All long-term survivors (five liver transplanted, one waiting for liver transplantation)
  currently show normal or near-normal neurological development (48 +- 39 months of
  age). Early response to RRT was associated with survival irrespective of pre-treatment
  picture. RRT can be considered even in huge neonatal metabolic decompensations.
  Early liver transplantation may be an option for select patients.
