input_text: "Treatment of maple syrup urine disease: Benefits, risks, and challenges
  of liver transplantation. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a deficiency
  in the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex,
  promoting the accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine,
  and valine, as well as their respective alpha-keto acids. MSUD is an autosomal recessive
  hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by ketoacidosis, ataxia, coma, and mental
  and psychomotor retardation. The mechanisms involved in the brain damage caused
  by MSUD are not fully understood. Early diagnosis and treatment, as well as proper
  control of metabolic decompensation crises, are crucial for patients' survival and
  for a better prognosis. The recommended treatment consists of a high-calorie diet
  with restricted protein intake and specific formulas containing essential amino
  acids, except those accumulated in MSUD. This treatment will be maintained throughout
  life, being adjusted according to the patients' nutritional needs and BCAA concentration.
  Because dietary treatment may not be sufficient to prevent neurological damage in
  MSUD patients, other therapeutic strategies have been studied, including liver transplantation.
  With transplantation, it is possible to obtain an increase of about 10% of the normal
  BCKD in the body, an amount sufficient to maintain amino acid homeostasis and reduce
  metabolic decompensation crises. However, the experience related to this practice
  is very limited when considering the shortage of liver for transplantation and the
  risks related to the surgical procedure and immunosuppression. Thus, the purpose
  of this review is to survey the benefits, risks, and challenges of liver transplantation
  in the treatment of MSUD."
