input_text: Intestinal Mucormycosis in a Child With Maple Syrup Urine Disease After
  Orthotopic Liver Transplant. Mucormycosis can result in serious morbidity and mortality,
  especially in transplant recipients. In this case report, we present a 3-year-old
  female patient with maple syrup urine disease who developed mucormycosis infection
  after deceased donor split liver transplant. Progressive segmental necrosis of the
  small intestines and new ischemic areas were observed after repeated abdominal surgeries.
  Microscopic examination of biopsy material revealed mucormycosis. Early recognition
  is crucial for treatment, and patients with clinical suspicion can be treated empirically
  with antifungal medicine. However, diagnostic tests with accurate and fast results
  are needed and more effective therapeutic methods should be developed for better
  outcomes.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
