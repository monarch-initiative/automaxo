input_text: Acute and long-term effects of intracerebroventricular administration
  of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid on oxidative stress parameters and cognitive and noncognitive
  behaviors. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is biochemically characterized by elevated
  levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine, as well as their corresponding transaminated
  branched-chain alpha-keto acids in tissue and biological fluids. Neurological symptoms
  and cerebral abnormalities, whose mechanisms are still unknown, are typical of this
  metabolic disorder. In the present study, we evaluated the early effects (1 h after
  injection) and long-term effects (15 days after injection) of a single intracerebroventricular
  administration of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) on oxidative stress parameters
  and cognitive and noncognitive behaviors. Our results showed that KIC induced early
  and long-term effects; we found an increase in TBARS levels, protein carbonyl content
  and DNA damage in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex both one hour and
  15 days after KIC administration. Moreover, SOD activity increased in the hippocampus
  and striatum one hour after injection, whereas after 15 days, SOD activity decreased
  only in the striatum. On the other hand, KIC significantly decreased CAT activity
  in the striatum one hour after injection, but 15 days after KIC administration,
  we found a decrease in CAT activity in the hippocampus and striatum. Finally, we
  showed that long-term cognitive deficits follow the oxidative damage; KIC induced
  impaired habituation memory and long-term memory impairment. From the biochemical
  and behavioral findings, it we presume that KIC provokes oxidative damage, and the
  persistence of brain oxidative stress is associated with long-term memory impairment
  and prepulse inhibition.
