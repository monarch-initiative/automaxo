input_text: Twin Premature Infants With Riboflavin and Biotin Deficiency Presenting
  With Refractory Lactic Acidosis, Rash, and Multiorgan Failure During Prolonged Parenteral
  Nutrition. We are reporting monochorionic, diamniotic twin premature infants born
  at 25 weeks and 6 days gestation with riboflavin (vitamin B2) and biotin (vitamin
  B7) deficiency, while on prolonged total parenteral nutrition (TPN) during vitamin
  shortage. They presented initially with skin rash, lactic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia.
  Both twins progressed to severe respiratory failure, severe lactic acidosis, with
  refractory vasodilatory shock, pancytopenia, ischemic bowel injury, acute kidney
  injury, liver injury, and capillary leak syndrome leading to death of twin A. The
  surviving twin B was diagnosed with riboflavin and biotin deficiency that presented
  with abnormal metabolic work up suggestive of maple syrup urine disease, glutaric
  acidemia type 2, and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Twin B was started on riboflavin
  and biotin supplementation at 41 days of life, with rapid improvement in clinical
  findings and laboratory abnormalities within days of starting biotin and riboflavin
  supplementation. He was discharged home in stable condition at 49 weeks of postmenstrual
  age.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
