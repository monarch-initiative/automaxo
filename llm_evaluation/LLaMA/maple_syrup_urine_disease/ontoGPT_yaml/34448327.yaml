input_text: 'Domino transplantation for pediatric liver recipients: Obstacles, challenges,
  and successes. BACKGROUND: Domino liver transplantation aims to address the need
  to increase the liver donor supply. In a domino liver transplant, the domino recipient
  receives the explanted liver from the recipient of a traditional liver transplant.
  The domino donor typically requires liver transplant to correct a metabolic disorder;
  the explanted liver thus has a single gene defect but otherwise normal structure
  and function. METHODS: In this review, we detail the history of domino liver transplantation,
  appropriate domino donor indications, the technical advances to the surgical approach,
  current outcomes, and future opportunities. RESULTS: Development of de novo disease
  in the domino recipient has relegated adult domino liver transplant to be considered
  a source of marginal donor livers. However, pediatric domino liver transplant has
  leveraged certain metabolic disorders, especially maple syrup urine disease, in
  which the liver enzyme deficiency can be compensated by the systemic presence of
  sufficient enzyme. Advances in the surgical aspects of assuring adequate length
  of vasculature have improved the safety of the procedure in both domino donors and
  recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric domino liver transplant utilizing domino donors
  with specific metabolic liver diseases should be considered a viable live donor
  option for children awaiting liver transplant.'
