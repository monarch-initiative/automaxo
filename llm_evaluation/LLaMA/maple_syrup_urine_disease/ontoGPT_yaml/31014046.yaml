input_text: 'Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration in the treatment of newborns
  with an inborn metabolic disease: a single center experience Background/aim: Most
  inborn metabolic diseases are diagnosed during the neonatal period. The accumulation
  of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological
  dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient
  removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous
  venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic
  disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease
  and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January
  2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical
  data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results:
  A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight
  newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease
  (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +-
  8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6
  mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively.
  Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before
  and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1
  h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6
  +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit
  clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate
  was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental
  and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to
  treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of
  specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely
  to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.'
