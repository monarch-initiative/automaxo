input_text: 'Domino liver transplants: where do we stand after a quarter-century?
  A US national analysis. BACKGROUND: Domino liver transplantation (DLT) utilizes
  a phenotypically normal explant from select recipients as a donor graft in another
  patient. The procedure is not widely employed and remains restricted to a small
  number of centers. The purpose of this study was to assess the national profile
  of DLT in the United States (US) and evaluate current survival outcomes. METHODS:
  The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried for all liver transplants
  (LT) between 1996 and 2020. Outcomes of interest were long-term graft and patient
  survival. RESULTS: Of 181,976 LTs performed nationally during the study period,
  185 (0.1%) were DLTs. Amyloidosis and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) accounted
  for 83% of dominoed allografts. Out of 210 explants with amyloidosis, 103 (49%)
  were dominoed into secondary recipients. Only 50 (22%) of all MSUD explants (n =
  227) were dominoed. Graft survival was 79%, 73% and 53% at 3-, 5- and 10-years,
  respectively, for DLT recipients. Overall patient survival was 83%, 76% and 57%
  at 3-, 5- and 10-years. CONCLUSION: Despite excellent long-term survival outcomes,
  DLT allografts comprise a very small percentage of the liver donor pool. A large
  proportion of potential DLTs may be unconscionably excluded despite shortages in
  deceased donor organs.'
