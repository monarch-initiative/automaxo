input_text: 'Domino liver transplantation in maple syrup urine disease: a case report
  and review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Improved outcomes have expanded the indications
  for liver transplantation, thus aggravating the already limited supply of donor
  organs. Domino liver transplantation (DLT) has been one strategy to augment the
  supply of donor organs in cases of inborn errors of metabolism. One such disease
  is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an inherited disorder of branched-chain amino
  acid (BCAA) metabolism. METHODS: We report on the transplantation of a deceased
  donor liver into a patient with MSUD, and the sequential transplantation of the
  explanted liver into a patient with hemophilia A, HIV, hepatitis C, and a low priority
  on the transplant waiting list. RESULTS: At 30 months, the MSUD recipient has had
  significant correction of BCAA metabolism on a protein-unrestricted diet and no
  progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The DLT recipient has been cured of hemophilia
  and has normal BCAA homeostasis. This case provides further evidence that elective
  orthotopic liver transplantation for MSUD attenuates the disease with restoration
  of BCAA metabolism, and that DLT in this setting can achieve excellent results in
  ESLD patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible that domino grafts from patients with
  MSUD could be used in more conventional recipients, but additional studies and longer-term
  outcomes are needed to determine the validity of DLT in MSUD.'
