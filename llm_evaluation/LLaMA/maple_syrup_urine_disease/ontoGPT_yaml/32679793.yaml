input_text: Effects of Cryogenic Storage on Human Amnion Epithelial Cells. Perinatal
  stem cells and epithelial cells isolated from full term amnion membrane, in particular,
  have attracted interest over the last decade, as a promising source of multipotent
  cells for cellular therapies. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) have been used
  to treat monogenetic liver disease such as maple syrup urine disease or fibrosis
  of the liver in preclinical studies. In most studies xeno-transplants of hAEC were
  conducted without providing immunosuppression to recipients, reflecting the tolerogenic
  properties of hAEC. For many cell types, successful cryopreservation is critical
  for providing a readily available, off-the-shelf product. In this study, hAEC were
  isolated from full-term human placenta from 14 different donors, cryopreserved using
  a protocol and reagents commonly adopted for epithelial cell preservation. The cells
  were analyzed in terms of survival, recovery, and homogeneity, profiled for surface
  markers characteristic of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, or hematopoietic
  cells. There were no significant differences observed in the percentage of cells
  with epithelial cell markers before and after cryopreservation. The relative proportion
  of stromal and hematopoietic cells was significantly reduced in hAEC preparations
  after cryopreservation. The expression of stem cell and immunomodulatory molecules
  were confirmed in the final product. Since multipotent cells are readily available
  from full-term placenta, this novel cell source might significantly increase the
  number of patients eligible to receive cellular therapies for liver and other diseases.

  symptoms: None mentioned

  chemicals: None mentioned

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  hAEC TREATS liver disease IN patients; 
  hAEC TREATS maple syrup urine disease IN patients; 
  hAEC TREATS fibrosis of the liver IN patients; 
  cryopreservation TREATS preservation of hAEC; 
  xeno-transplants PREVENTS immune response IN patients; 
  hAEC (with immunosuppression) TREATS liver disease IN patients 

  Note that the relationships are inferred based on the context of the text and may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate. Additionally, the text does not provide explicit information on the specific chemicals or drugs used in the medical actions, so the "chemicals" field is empty.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
