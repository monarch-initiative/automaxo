input_text: '[Anaesthesia in patients with maple syrup urine disease. Case report
  and perioperative anaesthetic management]. Maple syrup urine disease is a rare autosomal-recessive
  metabolic disorder caused by a deficit of oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain
  amino acids. First symptoms appear in the neonatal period. Without treatment the
  disease is characterized by rapid progression of neurological symptoms. During stressful
  situations, such as infection or surgery, patients may experience severe ketoacidosis,
  rapid neurological deterioration and hypoglycemia. The perioperative management
  of a 26-year-old man with maple syrup urine disease is described, a review of the
  disease is given and anaesthesia-related implications are discussed.'
