input_text: 'Surgical Aspects of Liver Transplantation and Domino Liver Transplantation
  in Maple Syrup Urine Disease: Analysis of 15 Donor-Recipient Pairs. Liver transplantation
  (LT) has been shown to be a feasible treatment in patients with severe forms of
  maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). Because of a sufficient extrahepatic enzyme activity
  in non-MSUD individuals, the organ of MSUD patients can be used as a domino graft.
  We performed a retrospective data collection of all LTs for MSUD carried out at
  the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (2016-2018). Moreover, data from
  all consecutive domino LTs of the MSUD grafts either transplanted at our institution
  or allocated to other transplant centers were analyzed. During the study period,
  15 LTs in MSUD patients were performed (12 children, 3 adults; median age, 10.9
  years; range, 0.3-26.1 years). Biliary complications occurred in 20%, and 13.3%
  suffered from bleeding complications. No further surgical problems occurred. At
  present, all MSUD patients are alive with a well-functioning liver graft and on
  an unrestricted diet. In total, 14 consecutive domino LTs were performed. No surgical
  complications requiring intervention occurred. One patient died because of HCC relapse,
  and all other patients are alive with good liver graft function. In conclusion,
  the use of MSUD livers as domino grafts is safe and allows application of LT in
  MSUD patients without net extraction of a liver graft from the limited donor pool.'
