input_text: 'Treatment of maple syrup urine disease with high flow hemodialysis in
  a neonate. Aygun F, Kiykim E, Aktuglu-Zeybek C, Zubarioglu T, Cam H. Treatment of
  maple syrup urine disease with high flow hemodialysis in a neonate. Turk J Pediatr
  2019; 61: 107-110. Continious renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a well recognizied
  treatment of choice in acute renal failure, however CRRT became a preferred treatment
  of metabolic emergencies with high leucine and ammonia levels like Maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD). MSUD is a rare metabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the activity
  of the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The toxic accumulation of
  branched chain amino acids during acute metabolic decompensation is associated with
  the appearance of permanent neurological symptoms. Four patients were admitted to
  our pediatric intensive care department with complains of poor feeding, vomitting,
  irratibility and coma. Physical examination of the neonates were similar having
  stupor, hypotonia and depressed newborn reflexes. The leucine levels were between
  930-4400 mumol/L. The diagnosis of MSUD was confirmed in all four. They were treated
  successfully with high flow CRRT having the rates were between 4120 ml/h/1.73m2
  and 9830 ml/h/1.73m2. Early treatment is essential to prevent neurotoxicity and
  death. CRRT is a choice of treatment in metabolic crisis of MSUD. Herein, we report
  the successful treatment of acute metabolic decompensation of MSUD with CRRT in
  4 neonates.'
