input_text: 'Successful pregnancy in maple syrup urine disease: a case report and
  review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal
  recessive disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Patients with MSUD are
  at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy.
  These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies
  in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable
  outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic
  outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations
  were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent
  compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300
  mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein
  and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy
  values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a
  detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and
  monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in
  week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was
  successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range
  throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview
  about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management
  of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients
  with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to
  minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)

  medical_actions: Monitoring of branched-chain amino acid concentrations; adjustment of dietary leucine intake; peripartal infusion therapy; primary Caesarean section; dietary recommendations; lactation implementation; monitoring parameters

  symptoms: Metabolic decompensations; ketoacidosis; encephalopathy; high leucine concentrations

  chemicals: Leucine; branched-chain amino acids

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - Monitoring of branched-chain amino acid concentrations TREATS metabolic decompensations IN MSUD;
  - Adjustment of dietary leucine intake TREATS high leucine concentrations IN MSUD;
  - Peripartal infusion therapy PREVENTS metabolic crisis IN MSUD;
  - Primary Caesarean section TREATS risk of metabolic crisis IN MSUD;
  - Dietary recommendations TREATS risk of metabolic crisis IN MSUD;
  - Lactation implementation TREATS lactation issues IN MSUD;
  - Monitoring parameters TREATS risk of metabolic crisis IN MSUD;
  - Increased protein and leucine intake TREATS high leucine concentrations IN MSUD during second trimester.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
