input_text: 'Continuous Venovenous Hemodiafiltration in the Treatment of Maple Syrup
  Urine Disease. BACKGROUND: The study aims to define the efficacy of continuous renal
  replacement therapy in acute metabolic decompensation treatment of maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD). METHODS: All the neonates, infants and children who have had life
  threatening conditions due to MSUD and were treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration
  (CVVHDF) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent 15
  sessions of CVVHDF (age range 15 days to 87 months, mean 40.8 +- 31.4 months). One
  patient required additional CVVHDF 1 week after cessation of CVVHDF. Twenty seven
  percent (n = 4) of the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twelve
  patients responded to treatment and dramatic neurological improvement was observed
  within 24 h. Two of the 14 patients required 36 h of CVVHDF for neurological improvement.
  The mean duration of CVVHDF was 20.2 +- 8.6 (9-36) h. The mean leucine level was
  1,648 +- 623.8 (714-2,768) mumol/l before and was 256.5 +- 150.6 (117-646) mumol/l
  at the end of treatment. No mortality was observed. CONCLUSION: Continuous hemodiafiltration
  is an effective and safe method in correcting metabolic disturbances in MSUD.'
