input_text: Neonatal gene therapy achieves sustained disease rescue of maple syrup
  urine disease in mice. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare recessively inherited
  metabolic disorder causing accumulation of branched chain amino acids leading to
  neonatal death, if untreated. Treatment for MSUD represents an unmet need because
  the current treatment with life-long low-protein diet is challenging to maintain,
  and despite treatment the risk of acute decompensations and neuropsychiatric symptoms
  remains. Here, based on significant liver contribution to the catabolism of the
  branched chain amino acid leucine, we develop a liver-directed adeno-associated
  virus (AAV8) gene therapy for MSUD. We establish and characterize the Bckdha (branched
  chain keto acid dehydrogenase a)-/- mouse that exhibits a lethal neonatal phenotype
  mimicking human MSUD. Animals were treated at P0 with intravenous human BCKDHA AAV8
  vectors under the control of either a ubiquitous or a liver-specific promoter. BCKDHA
  gene transfer rescued the lethal phenotype. While the use of a ubiquitous promoter
  fully and sustainably rescued the disease (long-term survival, normal phenotype
  and correction of biochemical abnormalities), liver-specific expression of BCKDHA
  led to partial, though sustained rescue. Here we show efficacy of gene therapy for
  MSUD demonstrating its potential for clinical translation.
