input_text: 'The implementation of neonatal peritoneal dialysis in a clinical setting.
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate etiology, outcome and complications related to neonatal
  peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: Neonates treated with PD in our neonatal intensive
  care unit during 2007-2010 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 4036 hospitalized
  neonates; 20 neonates (0.5%) who underwent 21 cycles of PD [7 preterm, 13 term;
  13 female, 7 male] were included. The mean birth weight was 2930.2 +- 720.6 g (1120-4570),
  mean gestational age was 37.5 +- 3.5 weeks (27-41). The etiologic disorders included
  inborn errors of metabolism (propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, citrullinemia,
  glutaric aciduria type 2, maple syrup urine disease, 10), or acute renal failure
  secondary to perinatal asphyxia (4), sepsis (2), prematurity (2), hypoplastic left
  heart syndrome (1), kernicterus (1). The complications included peritonitis (2),
  early leakage (4), hemorrhage (1), catheter removal (3) and occlusion (2). The mortality
  rate was 50%. The gestational ages and birth weights of surviving neonates were
  higher (p < 0.05). Among surviving neonates, chronic renal failure (1), severe (4)
  and moderate neuromotor impairment (2) developed within 4-43 months. CONCLUSION:
  PD, although invasive, is an effective therapy in neonates. The complexity and invasiveness
  of the procedure is probably responsible for high rate of complications and mortality.
  If appropriate catheter selection and technique in the placement should be done,
  PD might improve outcome.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
