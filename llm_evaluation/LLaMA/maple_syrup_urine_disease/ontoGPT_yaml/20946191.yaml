input_text: 'Cognitive and adaptive functioning after liver transplantation for maple
  syrup urine disease: a case series. MSUD is a complex metabolic disorder that has
  been associated with central nervous system damage, developmental delays, and neurocognitive
  deficits. Although liver transplantation provides a metabolic cure for MSUD, changes
  in cognitive and adaptive functioning following transplantation have not been investigated.
  In this report, we present data from 14 patients who completed cognitive and adaptive
  functioning testing pre- and one yr and/or three yr post-liver transplantation.
  Findings show either no significant change (n=8) or improvement (n=5) in IQ scores
  pre- to post-liver transplantation. Greater variability was observed in adaptive
  functioning scores, but the majority of patients evidenced no significant change
  (n=8) in adaptive scores. In general, findings indicate that liver transplantation
  minimizes the likelihood of additional central nervous system damage, providing
  an opportunity for possible stabilization or improvement in neurocognitive functioning.'
