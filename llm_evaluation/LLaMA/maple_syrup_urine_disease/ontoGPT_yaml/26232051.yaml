input_text: 'Evolution of maple syrup urine disease in patients diagnosed by newborn
  screening versus late diagnosis. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic
  disorder for which the newborn screening (NBS) is possible but it has not been yet
  implemented for most Spanish regions. In the present study, we assess the clinical
  features and outcome of 14 MSUD Spanish patients with similar treatment protocol
  diagnosed either by NBS or by clinical symptoms. Eight patients were detected by
  NBS, four classic and four moderate MSUD. The average age at detection was 4.6 days,
  the mean plasmatic concentration of leucine at diagnosis was 1807 muM; the average
  number of days with leucine >1000 muM was 0.7 (0-4) and the mean number of total
  hospitalizations was 1.6 (0-5). Mean follow-up time was 70 months. They had good
  evolution: all remain asymptomatic, but 2 patients have attention deficit and hyperactivity
  disorder. Six patients with late diagnosis of classic MSUD were followed during
  41 months. All presented with acute encephalopathy during the first month of life,
  mean leucine levels of 2355 muM, mean number of days with leucine >1000 muM of 6.6
  (1-13) and mean number of total hospitalizations of 5.3 (4-7). Only two patients
  have a psychomotor development index in the lower limit (80 and 83). For all patients
  a good genotype-phenotype correlation was found and four novel mutations were identified:
  p.A311H, p.T84S, p.T397L, pL398P. Our study support that NBS improves prognosis
  of MSUD patients. But early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment together with
  a close monitoring of leucine levels improve neurological evolution in MSUD patients,
  even for those not detected by NBS. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
