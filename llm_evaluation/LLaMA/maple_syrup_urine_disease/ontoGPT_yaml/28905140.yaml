input_text: 'Long-term metabolic follow-up and clinical outcome of 35 patients with
  maple syrup urine disease. BACKGROUND: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare
  disease that requires a protein-restricted diet for successful management. Little
  is known, however, about the psychosocial outcome of MSUD patients. This study investigates
  the relationship between metabolic and clinical parameters and psychosocial outcomes
  in a cohort of patients with neonatal-onset MSUD. METHODS: Data on academic achievement,
  psychological care, family involvement, and biochemical parameters were collected
  from the medical records of neonatal MSUD patients treated at Necker Hospital (Paris)
  between 1964 and 2013. RESULTS: Thirty-five MSUD patients with a mean age of 16.3
  (2.1-49.0) years participated. Metabolic decompensations (plasma leucine >380 mumol/L)
  were more frequent during the first year of life and after 15 years, mainly due
  to infection and dietary noncompliance, respectively. Leucine levels increased significantly
  in adulthood: 61.5% of adults were independent and achieved adequate social and
  professional integration; 56% needed occasional or sustained psychological or psychiatric
  care (8/19, with externalizing, mood, emotional, and anxiety disorders being the
  most common). Patients needing psychiatric care were significantly older [mean and
  standard deviation (SD) 22.6 (7.7) years] than patients needing only psychological
  follow-up [mean (SD) 14.3 (8.9) years]. Patients with psychological follow-up experienced
  the highest lifetime number of decompensations; 45% of families had difficulty coping
  with the chronic disease. Parental involvement was negatively associated with the
  number of lifetime decompensations. CONCLUSION: Adults had increased levels of plasma
  leucine, consistent with greater chronic toxicity. Psychological care was associated
  with age and number of decompensations. In addition, parental involvement appeared
  to be crucial in the management of MSUD patients.'
