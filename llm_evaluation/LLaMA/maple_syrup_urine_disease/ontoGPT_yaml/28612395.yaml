input_text: A case of classical maple syrup urine disease that was successfully managed
  by living donor liver transplantation. Classical MSUD is often fatal without appropriate
  medical interventions because of metabolic crisis. There are numerous reports suggesting
  the therapeutic potential of deceased donor liver transplantation for MSUD. However,
  the usefulness of LDLT for MSUD is unknown. We report a case of classical MSUD,
  which was successfully managed by LDLT from the patient's father at 1 year of age.
  Abnormal brain findings, which were cured with effective treatment, gradually disappeared
  after LDLT. The patient then developed normally. Findings from this case suggest
  the importance of LDLT for maintaining low leucine levels and subsequent normal
  neurological development. Although LDLT involves a modest surgical insult, LDLT
  with a related donor achieves acceptable leucine levels for life.
