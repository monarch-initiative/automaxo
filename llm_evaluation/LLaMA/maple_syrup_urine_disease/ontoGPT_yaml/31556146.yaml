input_text: "Technique and outcome of domino liver transplantation from patients with
  maple syrup urine disease: Expanding the donor pool for live donor liver transplantation.
  AIM/BACKGROUND: Domino liver transplantation (DLT) using liver allografts from patients
  with metabolic disorders enhances organ utilization. Short- and long-term course
  and outcome of these patients can impact the decision to offer this procedure to
  patients, especially those with diseases that can potentially be cured with liver
  transplant. We reviewed the outcomes of DLT from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
  patients in our large academic pediatric and adult transplant program. METHODS:
  All patients receiving DLT were analyzed retrospectively with a minimum of one-year
  follow-up period for patient and donor characteristics, early and late postoperative
  complications and patient and graft survival with their MSUD donors in terms of
  age, weight, MELD/PELD scores, cold ischemia time, postoperative leucine levels,
  and peak ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels during the first 48 postoperative
  hours. RESULTS: Between 2006 and May 2019, 21 patients underwent domino liver transplantation
  with live donor allografts from MSUD patients. Four patients transplanted for different
  metabolic diseases are focus of a separate report. Seventeen patients with minimum
  one-year follow-up period are reported herein. The indications were primary sclerosing
  cholangitis (PSC, n = 4), congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, n = 2), alpha-1 antitrypsin
  deficiency (A-1 ATD, n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC,
  n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1), neonatal
  hepatitis (n = 1), embryonal sarcoma (n = 1), Caroli disease (n = 1), hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and chronic rejection after liver transplantations for PSC
  (n = 1). All patients and grafts survived at median follow-up of 6.4 years (range
  1.2-12.9 years). Median domino recipient age was 16.2 years (range 0.6-64.6 years)
  and median MSUD recipient age was 17.6 years (range 4.8-32.1 years). There were
  no vascular complications during the early postoperative period, one patient had
  portal vein thrombosis 3 years after DLT and a meso-Rex bypass was successfully
  performed. Small for size syndrome (SFSS) occurred in reduced left lobe DLT recipient
  and was managed successfully with conservative management. Biliary stricture developed
  in 2 patients and was resolved by stenting. Comparison between DLT and MSUD recipients'
  peak postoperative ALT results and PELD/MELD scores showed lower levels in DLT group
  (P-value <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient and graft survival in DLT from MSUD donors
  was excellent at short- and long-term follow-up. Metabolic functions have been normal
  in all recipients on a normal unrestricted protein diet. Ischemia preservation injury
  based on peak ALT was significantly decreased in DLT recipients. Domino transplantation
  from pediatric and adult recipients with selected metabolic diseases should be increasingly
  considered as an excellent option and alternative to deceased donor transplantation,
  thereby expanding the living donor pool. This, to date, is the largest world experience
  in DLT utilizing livers from patients with MSUD."
