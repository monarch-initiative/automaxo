input_text: 'Domino liver transplantation: indications, techniques, and outcomes.
  The long-term shortage of livers available for transplantation has spurred the development
  of many strategies to bolster the donor organ supply. One particularly innovative
  strategy is domino liver transplantation in which a select group of liver transplant
  recipients can donate their explanted native livers for use as liver grafts in other
  patients. Several hereditary metabolic diseases (such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy,
  maple syrup urine disease, and familial hypercholesterolemia) are caused by aberrant
  or deficient protein production in the liver, and these conditions can be cured
  with an orthotopic liver transplant. Although their native livers eventually caused
  severe systemic disease in these patients, these livers are otherwise structurally
  and functionally normal, and they have been used successfully in domino liver transplants
  for the past 15 years. This article will review the indications for donating or
  receiving a domino liver transplant, the surgical techniques necessary to perform
  these transplants, as well as the recently revealed long-term outcomes and risks
  of domino transplantation.'
