input_text: 'Short-term results of continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration versus
  peritoneal dialysis in 40 neonates with inborn errors of metabolism. Several recent
  studies have reported that toxic metabolites accumulated in the body as a product
  of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are eliminated more rapidly with continuous
  venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) than with peritoneal dialysis (PD). However,
  there is still uncertainty about the impacts of dialysis modalities on the short-term
  outcome. Here, it was aimed to investigate the effects of dialysis modalities on
  the short-term outcome. This retrospective study included 40 newborn infants who
  underwent PD (29 patients) or CVVHDF (11 patients) due to inborn errors of metabolism
  at a tertiary centre, between June 2013 and March 2018. The outcomes and the potential
  effects of the dialysis modality were evaluated. Of 40 patients, 21 were urea cycle
  defect, 14 were organic academia, and 5 were maple syrup urine disease. The median
  50% reduction time of toxic metabolites were shorter in patients treated with CVVHDF
  (p < 0.05). Catheter blockage was the most common complication observed in PD group
  (24.1%), whereas in CVVHDF group hypotension and filter blockage were more common.
  There was no significant difference in mortality between dialysis groups (38% vs.
  45.4%, p > 0.05). In patients with hyperammonaemia, duration of plasma ammonia >
  200 mug/dL was the most important factor influencing mortality (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09,
  p = 0.007).Conclusion: This study showed that CVVHDF is more efficient than PD to
  rapidly eliminate toxic metabolites caused by IEM in newborn infants, but not in
  improving survival. What is Known:  Toxic metabolites are eliminated more rapidly
  with CVVHDF than with PD.  Higher complication rates were reported with rigid peritoneal
  catheters in PD and catheter blockage in CVVHDF. What is New:  Prolonged duration
  of plasma ammonia levels above a safe limit (200 mug/dL) was associated with increased
  mortality.  Lower catheter-related complication rates may have been associated with
  the use of Tenckhoff catheters in PD and the use of right internal jugular vein
  in CVVHDF.'
