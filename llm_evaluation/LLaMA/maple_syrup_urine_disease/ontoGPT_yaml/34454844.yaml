input_text: Muscle-directed AAV gene therapy rescues the maple syrup urine disease
  phenotype in a mouse model. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited
  metabolic disorder characterized by a dysfunctional mitochondrial enzyme complex,
  branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which catabolizes branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAAs). Without functional BCKDH, BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto
  intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues. MSUD is currently incurable
  and treatment is limited to dietary restriction or liver transplantation, meaning
  there is a great need to develop new treatments for MSUD. We evaluated potential
  gene therapy applications for MSUD in the intermediate MSUD (iMSUD) mouse model,
  which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2
  (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. Systemic delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector
  expressing DBT under control of the liver-specific TBG promoter to the liver did
  not sufficiently ameliorate all aspects of the disease phenotype. These findings
  necessitated an alternative therapeutic strategy. Muscle makes a larger contribution
  to BCAA metabolism than liver in humans, but a muscle-specific approach involving
  a muscle-specific promoter for DBT expression delivered via intramuscular (IM) administration
  only partially rescued the MSUD phenotype in mice. Combining the muscle-tropic AAV9
  capsid with the ubiquitous CB7 promoter via IM or IV injection, however, substantially
  increased survival across all assessed doses. Additionally, near-normal serum BCAA
  levels were achieved and maintained in the mid- and high-dose cohorts throughout
  the study; this approach also protected these mice from a lethal high-protein diet
  challenge. Therefore, administration of a gene therapy vector that expresses in
  both muscle and liver may represent a viable approach to treating patients with
  MSUD.
