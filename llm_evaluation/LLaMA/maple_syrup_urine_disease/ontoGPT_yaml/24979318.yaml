input_text: 'Liver transplantation for classical maple syrup urine disease: long-term
  follow-up. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate indications, results,
  and clinical and neurological evolution in children who have undergone liver transplantation
  for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). METHODS: Descriptive study of liver
  transplantation for MSUD between 1991 and 2012. Eight patients were transplanted.
  RESULTS: Indications for transplant were poor metabolic control expressed as significant
  psychomotor disabilities (4 had psychomotor delays, 5 had spasticity, and 5 had
  epilepsy) and poor quality of life (mean number of acute metabolic decompensations
  and mean number of total hospitalizations before transplantation 5 and 12, respectively).
  Four required nasogastric tube, with a maximum 4 g/day protein-restricted diet in
  all of them. Seven sustained significant alterations in brain magnetic resonance
  imaging. Mean leucine and alloisoleucine levels were 608 (standard deviation [SD]
  516) and 218 mumol/L (SD 216), respectively. All of the patients received transplants
  with deceased-donor livers, with ages between 1.5 and 2.5 years (mean 1.78 years).
  Mean posttransplantation follow-up period was 12.2 years (range 5-21 years). Final
  patient and graft survival was 87.5% and 75%, respectively. Following transplantation,
  none required hospitalization in the last 3 years nor did any have new acute metabolic
  decompensations following a normal diet. Five followed normal schooling, 2 had motor
  disabilities, and 2 had convulsive crises. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was
  taken in 4 patients, showing neuroimage improvement in 3 of them. Mean leucine levels
  were <350 mumol/L from the immediate posttransplantation period (mean 225 mumol/L,
  SD 78), with a maximum alloisoleucine level of 20 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation
  is an effective treatment for classical MSUD that arrests brain damage, although
  it does not reverse the process.'
