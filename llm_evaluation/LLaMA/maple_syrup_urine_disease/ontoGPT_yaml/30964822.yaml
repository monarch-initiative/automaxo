input_text: Differential Intraoperative Effect of Liver Transplant in Different Inborn
  Errors of Metabolism. Liver transplant (LT) is a therapeutic option for a growing
  number of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), including some disorders not confined
  to the liver. Clinical advantages of LT in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), methylmalonic
  acidemia (MMA), and argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) have been reported. However,
  no information on the early metabolic effect of LT after portal reperfusion is available
  in these disorders. Here we describe the intraoperative differential metabolic outcome
  of LT in MSUD, MMA, and ASA. In these IEM, LT promptly cleared toxic metabolites
  to safe concentrations. In MSUD, leucine concentration reached physiological concentration
  within 12 hours after portal reperfusion. In MMA and ASA, LT allowed faster clearance
  of methylmalonate and argininosuccinate, respectively, both dropping by ~90% within
  the first hour after portal reperfusion. The early biochemical benefits of LT in
  MSUD, MMA, and ASA demonstrate its immediate effectiveness in protecting patients
  from intercurrent metabolic decompensations.
