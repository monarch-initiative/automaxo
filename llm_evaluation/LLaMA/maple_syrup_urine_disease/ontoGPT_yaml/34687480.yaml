input_text: "Surgical technique and the long-term outcomes of pediatric living donor
  domino liver transplantation from patients with maple syrup urine disease. BACKGROUND:
  The native liver of patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) (1st recipients)
  can be used as a graft for non-MSUD patients with end-stage liver disease (2nd recipients).
  This study aimed to demonstrate the optimal operational procedures and the long-term
  outcomes of 2nd recipients. METHODS: Six 2nd recipients of living donor domino liver
  transplantation (LD-DLT) (age: 42.5 [22-169] months at DLT) received a native liver
  as a graft from an MSUD patient at our hospital between June 2014 and April 2020.
  We reviewed the operational procedures and outcomes of 2nd recipients after LD-DLT.
  RESULTS: The 2nd recipients' original diseases included biliary atresia, congenital
  hepatic fibrosis, congenital protein C deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia,
  hepatoblastoma, and mitochondrial hepatopathy. Five of the six recipients had a
  whole liver and one had a right lobe graft. The site at which the vessels of the
  MSUD liver were dissected prioritized the safety of the 1st recipient. At the end
  of follow-up, all recipients were doing well without surgical complications. The
  mean serum amino acid values of the 2nd recipients did not exceed the upper limit
  of the reference values during the long-term observation period. All patients showed
  normal growth while maintaining the same z-score of height and weight after LD-DLT
  as the preoperative level. CONCLUSION: The liver of patients with MSUD can be used
  safely without concern regarding long-term complications or de novo MSUD development.
  LD-DLT using the MSUD liver can expand the donor pool as an alternative graft in
  pediatric LT."
