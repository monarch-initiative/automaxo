input_text: Living related versus deceased donor liver transplantation for maple syrup
  urine disease. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder of branched
  chain ketoacid (BCKA) oxidation associated with episodic and chronic brain disease.
  Transplantation of liver from an unrelated deceased donor restores 9-13% whole-body
  BCKA oxidation capacity and stabilizes MSUD. Recent reports document encouraging
  short-term outcomes for MSUD patients who received a liver segment from mutation
  heterozygous living related donors (LRDT). To investigate effects of living related
  versus deceased unrelated grafts, we studied four Brazilian MSUD patients treated
  with LRDT who were followed for a mean 19 +- 12 postoperative months, and compared
  metabolic and clinical outcomes to 37 classical MSUD patients treated with deceased
  donor transplant. Patient and graft survival for LRDT were 100%. Three of 4 MSUD
  livers were successfully domino transplanted into non-MSUD subjects. Following LRDT,
  all subjects resumed a protein-unrestricted diet as mean plasma leucine decreased
  from 224 +- 306 muM to 143 +- 44 muM and allo-isoleucine decreased 91%. We observed
  no episodes of hyperleucinemia during 80 aggregate postoperative patient-months.
  Mean plasma leucine:isoleucine:valine concentration ratios were ~2:1:4 after deceased
  donor transplant compared to ~1:1:1.5 following LRDT, resulting in differences of
  predicted cerebral amino acid uptake. Mutant heterozygous liver segments effectively
  maintain steady-state BCAA and BCKA homeostasis on an unrestricted diet and during
  most catabolic states, but might have different metabolic effects than grafts from
  unrelated deceased donors. Neither living related nor deceased donor transplant
  affords complete protection from metabolic intoxication, but both strategies represent
  viable alternatives to nutritional management.
