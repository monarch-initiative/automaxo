input_text: The Impact of Diet on Body Composition in a Cohort of Pediatric and Adult
  Patients with Maple Syrup Urine Disease. The treatment for Maple Syrup Urine Disease
  (MSUD) consists of a hypoproteic diet with integration therapy to limit leucine
  intake, ensuring adequate energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients to prevent
  catabolism and promote anabolism. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study
  at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza,
  Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation,
  and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the
  dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect
  of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight,
  BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected.
  Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which
  5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet
  and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass.
  A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation
  between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free
  mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive
  effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition
  of patients with MSUD. A similar study involving all Italian metabolic centers treating
  MSUD is recommended.

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)

  medical_actions: hypoproteic diet; integration therapy to limit leucine intake; liver transplantation; dietary treatment with low-protein and semi-synthetic diet

  symptoms: osteopenia; catabolism; low lean mass; low bone mineral density

  chemicals: leucine; BCAA-free mixture

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - hypoproteic diet TREATS catabolism IN MSUD; 
  - integration therapy TREATS catabolism IN MSUD; 
  - dietary treatment (with low-protein and semi-synthetic diet) TREATS lean mass and bone mineral density IN MSUD; 
  - BCAA-free mixture PREVENTS bone mineral density IN MSUD; 
  - liver transplantation TREATS MSUD

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
