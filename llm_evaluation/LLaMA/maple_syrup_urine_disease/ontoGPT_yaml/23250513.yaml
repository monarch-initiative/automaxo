input_text: 'Treatment of acute decompensation of maple syrup urine disease in adult
  patients with a new parenteral amino-acid mixture. BACKGROUND: Acute decompensation
  of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is usually treated by enteral feeding with an
  amino-acid mixture without leucine (Leu), valine or isoleucine. However, its administration
  is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral
  feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture
  for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult
  patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared
  to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E).
  RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P
  and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the
  Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher
  in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration
  of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated
  whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral
  amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during
  acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric
  tube insertion.'
