input_text: 'Heterozygote to homozygote related living donor liver transplantation
  in maple syrup urine disease: a case report. Liver transplantation is an accepted
  treatment modality in the management of MSUD. To our knowledge, ours is only the
  second successful case to date of a patient with MSUD receiving an allograft from
  an RLD who is a heterozygous carrier for the disease. In view of the worldwide shortage
  of available organs for transplantation, heterozygote to homozygote transplantation
  in the setting of MSUD may provide a viable alternative for those awaiting transplantation.
  We report on the case of a two-yr-old infant with MSUD, who received a left lateral
  segment (segments II and III) liver transplant from his mother, a heterozygote carrier
  of one of the three abnormal genes implicated in MSUD. Post-operative BCAA levels
  normalized in our patient and remained so on an unrestricted protein diet and during
  times of physiological stress. To date, this is only the second case of a successful
  RLD liver transplant in a child with MSUD. Preliminary results indicate that RLD
  liver transplants are at least equivalent to deceased donor liver transplants in
  the treatment of MSUD, although longer term follow-up is required. Heterozygote
  to homozygote RLD transplant in patients with MSUD presents a new pool of potential
  liver donors. '
