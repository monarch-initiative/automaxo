  with inborn errors of amino acid metabolism receiving nutrition therapy. OBJECTIVES:
  There is growing concern about the low-protein and high-energy diet therapies used
  in the treatment of inherited amino acid metabolism disorders. We aimed to identify
  the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases that may arise from nutritional therapies
  and suggests approaches that may prevent the development of the noncommunicable
  diseases. METHODS: The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional
  therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the
  amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings. The participants are assessed
  for the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome based on an analysis of
  anthropometric parameters, body composition and the results of biochemical tests.
  RESULTS: Anthropometric measurements including BMI, weight Z-score, waist circumference
  and fat mass were not significantly different between patients and controls. Height
  Z-scores were similar in phenylketonuria patients compared to controls, but lower
  in urea cycle disorders, organic acidemia and maple syrup urine disease groups.
  No increased risk of development of overweight or metabolic syndrome was detected
  in the patient group, while there were findings suggesting malnutrition in patients
  diagnosed with urea cycle disorders. There was a correlation between patients' BMI
  and C3-carnitine levels in organic acidemia patients and leucine levels in maple
  syrup urine disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: All forms of malnutrition can be prevented
  in patient groups receiving limited nutrients under a dietary management protocol,
  based on the findings of anthropometric and biochemical evaluations and analyses
  of body composition."
