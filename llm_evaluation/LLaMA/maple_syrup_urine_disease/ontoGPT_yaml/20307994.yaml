input_text: 'Maple syrup urine disease: further evidence that newborn screening may
  fail to identify variant forms. Newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry
  (MS/MS) has allowed for early detection and initiation of treatment in many patients
  with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) (OMIM 248600), however, a recent report suggests
  that variants forms may be missed. Information on these patients is limited. We
  present clinical, biochemical and molecular information on patients with variant
  forms of MSUD not detected by the California Newborn Screening Program. Between
  July 2005 and July 2009, 2200,000 newborns were screened in California by MS/MS.
  Seventeen cases of MSUD were detected and three (two siblings) were missed. Additionally,
  the NBS cards of two siblings with late onset MSUD, who were born pre-expanded NBS,
  were retrospectively analyzed. None of the five patients met criteria to be considered
  presumptive positive for MSUD (leucine>200micromol/L and a ratio of leucine/alanine>or=1.5).
  Alloisoleucine (allo-ile) was subsequently analyzed in the NBS cards of all five
  patients, two of whom were found to have elevated levels. The proband in each family
  was diagnosed following symptoms triggered by an intercurrent illness or increased
  protein intake. At diagnosis, leucine levels ranged between 561 and >4528micromol/L,
  and allo-ile ranged from 137 to 239micromol/L. Two affected siblings had normal
  plasma amino acids when asymptomatic; however, their biochemical profiles were diagnostic
  of MSUD during intercurrent illnesses. The median age at diagnosis of all patients
  was one year (range 0.8-6.7). Heterozygous BCKDHB (E1beta) mutations (c.832G>A/c.970C>T)
  were identified in one family and a homozygous DBT (E2) sequence variant (c.1430
  T>G) in another. The third family had one identifiable DBT mutation (c.827T>G),
  however, a second mutation was not detected. This report provides further evidence
  that NBS by MS/MS is unable to detect all cases of MSUD. Second-tier testing with
  allo-ile may improve sensitivity; however, some children with variant forms will
  invariably be missed.'
