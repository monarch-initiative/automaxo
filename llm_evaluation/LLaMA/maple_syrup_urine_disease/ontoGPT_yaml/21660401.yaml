input_text: "Impact of inborn errors of metabolism on admission in a neonatal intensive
  care unit--a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of Inborn
  errors of metobolism (IEM) in Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using tandem mass
  spectrometry and to determine the impact that these disorders have on NICU resources.
  METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper
  samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass
  spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and
  by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical
  follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation
  period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive
  and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in
  the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common
  inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases
  needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two
  cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic
  Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight
  patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay
  was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four
  of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in
  NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders
  prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive
  mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM."

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)

  medical_actions: aggressive treatment; invasive mechanical ventilation; early therapeutic intervention

  symptoms: None explicitly mentioned, but the following can be inferred as symptoms or consequences of the diseases: need for invasive mechanical ventilation; increased mortality; prolonged NICU stay

  chemicals: None explicitly mentioned, but the following diseases are mentioned, which are related to specific chemicals or metabolic disorders: 
  methylmalonic acidemia; Tyrosinemia type 1; Maple Syrup Urine Disease; Propionic Acidemia; Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD)

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation; 
  aggressive treatment TREATS inborn errors of metabolism (IEM); 
  invasive mechanical ventilation TREATS respiratory symptoms IN inborn errors of metabolism (IEM); 
  early therapeutic intervention TREATS inborn errors of metabolism (IEM); 
  inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) causes increased mortality; 
  inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) causes prolonged NICU stay. 

  Note that the relationships are inferred based on the text and may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate. 

  Also, note that tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry are medical tests, not actions, and therefore are not included in the medical_actions list. Similarly, clinical follow-up is not a medical action in the classical sense, but rather a study methodology.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
