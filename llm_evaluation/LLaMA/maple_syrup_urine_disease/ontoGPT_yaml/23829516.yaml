input_text: 'Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD): a case with long-term follow-up after
  liver transplantation. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare hereditary metabolic
  condition where the body is unable to breakdown amino acids causing toxic buildup.
  Acute and long-term management of MSUD involves a restricted diet and regular monitoring
  of amino acid levels; however, more recently liver transplants have been shown to
  be successful in treating this condition. Even with successful management of MSUD
  there is evidence from pediatric cases that shows a distinct pattern of neurocognitive
  deficits associated with this condition, including impaired nonverbal skills and
  psychomotor functioning with relatively intact verbal abilities. In the present
  paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and
  functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no
  structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation
  showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning,
  and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills. The patient
  also showed reduced adaptive functioning and mild anxiety. This case demonstrates
  neurocognitive deficiencies within the context of normal magnetic resonance imaging.
  The possible underlying mechanism of this neuropsychological profile is discussed
  in relation to other neurodevelopmental models. '
