input_text: '[Peritoneal dialysis in a neonate with maple syrup urine disease. A case
  report]. Maple syrup disease is an autosomal recessive entity caused by a congenital
  error in the metabolism of three essential branchedchain amino acids: valine, leucine
  and isoleucine. The neonatal form of this disease is expressed by a severe and progressive
  neurological compromise, associated with a peculiar smell of urine, a consequence
  of the elimination of the excess of these amino acids. This smell of burnt sugar
  mimics the molasses obtained from maples, which gives its name to this disease.
  The best method to eliminate these toxins is hemodiafiltration, but in centers where
  this practice is not possible, peritoneal dialysis is an alternative. We present
  a newborn with leukinosis with severe central nervous system involvement in whom
  peritoneal dialysis was useful to overcome metabolic decompensation.'
