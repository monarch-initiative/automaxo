input_text: 'Variant haplophasing by long-read sequencing: a new approach to preimplantation
  genetic testing workups. OBJECTIVE: To apply long-read, third-generation sequencing
  as a part of a general workup strategy for performing structural rearrangement (PGT-SR)
  and monogenic disease (PGT-M) embryo testing. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING:
  In vitro fertilization unit. PATIENT(S): Couples presenting for PGT-SR (n = 15)
  and PGT-M (n = 2). INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy with molecular testing for
  translocation breakpoints or mutations (targets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detailed,
  parental-phased, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles around targets for
  selection of informative polymorphic markers to simplify and facilitate clinical
  preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) designs that enable discrimination between
  carrier and noncarrier embryos. RESULT(S): High definition of chromosome breakpoints
  together with closely phased polymorphic markers was achieved for all 15 couples
  presenting for PGT-SR. Similarly, for the two couples presenting for PGT-M, tightly
  linked informative markers around the mutations were also simply identified. Three
  couples with translocations t(1;17)(q21;p13), t(3;13)(p25;q21.2), and t(12;13)(q23;q22)
  proceeded with PGT-SR, requesting preferential identification of noncarrier embryos
  for transfer. Following selection of a set of informative SNPs linked to breakpoints,
  we successfully performed PGT-SR tests, resulting in ongoing pregnancies with a
  noncarrier fetus for all couples. Similarly, with the use of tests based on informative
  SNPs linked to the parental mutations, one couple proceeded with PGT-M for maple
  syrup urine disease, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy with a disease-free fetus.
  CONCLUSION(S): For couples contemplating clinical PGT, variant haplophasing around
  the target reduces the workup process by enabling rapid selection of closely linked
  informative markers for patient-specific test design.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS).
