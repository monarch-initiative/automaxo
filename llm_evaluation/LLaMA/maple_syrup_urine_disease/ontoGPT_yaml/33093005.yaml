input_text: 'Nutrition management guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  deficiency (VLCAD): An evidence- and consensus-based approach. The nutrition management
  guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD) is the fourth
  in a series of web-based guidelines focusing on the diet treatment for inherited
  metabolic disorders and follows previous publication of guidelines for maple syrup
  urine disease (2014), phenylketonuria (2016) and propionic acidemia (2019). The
  purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring
  of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six
  research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition
  recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation,
  monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes
  the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and
  abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert
  input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review
  from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of
  the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by
  a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access
  of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers
  and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their
  families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International
  (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp)
  websites.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD)

  medical_actions: diet treatment; nutrition recommendations; supplementation; monitoring; physical activity management; management during pregnancy

  symptoms: Not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred that symptoms related to VLCAD are being addressed through the nutrition management guideline.

  chemicals: Not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred that certain nutrients or supplements may be involved in the nutrition recommendations.

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - diet treatment TREATS VLCAD;
  - nutrition recommendations TREATS VLCAD;
  - supplementation TREATS VLCAD;
  - monitoring PREVENTS complications IN VLCAD;
  - physical activity management TREATS VLCAD;
  - management during pregnancy TREATS VLCAD.

  Note that the text does not provide explicit information about specific symptoms or chemicals, so the above extraction is based on inference and may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate.
prompt: |+
  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
