input_text: 'Liver-directed gene therapy for inherited metabolic diseases. Gene therapy
  clinical trials are rapidly expanding for inherited metabolic liver diseases whilst
  two gene therapy products have now been approved for liver based monogenic disorders.
  Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias
  and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited
  metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different
  gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing.
  We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number
  of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias,
  Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria
  and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions
  for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity,
  gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing
  number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits
  and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments.
  Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative
  therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients
  suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.'
