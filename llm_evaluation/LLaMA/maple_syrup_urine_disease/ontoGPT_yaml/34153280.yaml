input_text: 'Metabolic Control and "Ideal" Outcomes in Liver Transplantation for Maple
  Syrup Urine Disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess outcomes following liver transplantation
  for maple syrup urine disease by determining attainment and sustainability of metabolic
  control and apply an "ideal" outcome composite in long-term survivors. STUDY DESIGN:
  A single center, retrospective review collected clinical data including branched-chain
  amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels following liver transplant and
  determined achievement of an ideal long-term outcome profile of a first allograft
  stable on immunosuppression monotherapy, normal growth, and absence of common transplant-related
  sequelae. RESULTS: Of 77 patients meeting inclusion criteria identified, 23 were
  long-term (>=10-year) survivors and were additionally assessed for ideal outcome
  attainment. Patient and graft survival were 100% and 99%, respectively, and all
  patients were on an unrestricted protein intake diet. Although significant variation
  was noted in mean isoleucine (P < .01) and leucine (P < .05) levels postliver transplantation,
  no difference was seen in valine (P = .29) and overall clinical impact was likely
  negligible as metabolic stability was achieved and sustained beyond 3 years postliver
  transplantation and no metabolic crises were identified. Of 23 long-term survivors
  with available data, 9 (39%) achieved all composite metrics determined to define
  "ideal" outcomes in pediatric postliver transplantation populations. CONCLUSIONS:
  Liver transplant enables long-term metabolic stability for patients with maple syrup
  urine disease. A combination of experience and improvement in both pre- and postliver
  transplantation care has enabled excellent survival and minimal comorbidities following
  transplant.'
