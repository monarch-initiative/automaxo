input_text: 'Perspectives on dietary adherence among women with inborn errors of metabolism.
  Adherence to highly restrictive diets is critical for women of childbearing age
  who have inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria. The purpose of this
  study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary
  adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence
  among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level
  interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups
  including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria,
  methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer
  camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts.
  Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and
  some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many
  reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced
  in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining
  dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular
  who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods
  was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning
  from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies
  for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for
  women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some,
  educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered
  dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care
  providers.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: inborn errors of metabolism; phenylketonuria; methylmalonic acidemia; maple syrup urine disease

  medical_actions: dietary adherence; symptom-based dietary monitoring; educating school officials about medical diets; expanding the role of registered dietitians; assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers

  symptoms: feelings of being different

  chemicals: phenylalanine (not explicitly mentioned but related to phenylketonuria); medical foods

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - dietary adherence TREATS inborn errors of metabolism;
  - symptom-based dietary monitoring TREATS symptoms IN inborn errors of metabolism;
  - educating school officials about medical diets PREVENTS feelings of being different IN inborn errors of metabolism;
  - expanding the role of registered dietitians TREATS inborn errors of metabolism;
  - assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers TREATS inborn errors of metabolism;
  - medical foods TREATS inborn errors of metabolism. 

  Note that the text does not provide explicit relationships between specific medical actions and symptoms, so some relationships are inferred based on the context. Also, the text mentions specific diseases (phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, and maple syrup urine disease) which are all types of inborn errors of metabolism. 

  Please double-check citations as I don't have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
