input_text: 'Management of a Woman With Maple Syrup Urine Disease During Pregnancy,
  Delivery, and Lactation. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder
  of metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
  Complications of acute elevation in plasma leucine include ketoacidosis and risk
  of cerebral edema, which can be fatal. Individuals with MSUD are at risk of metabolic
  crisis throughout life, especially at times of physiological stress. We present
  a case of successful management of a woman with MSUD through pregnancy, delivery,
  postpartum, and lactation, including nutrition therapy using modified parenteral
  nutrition. '
