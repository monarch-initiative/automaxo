input_text: 'Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica: lessons from two pediatric cases. OBJECTIVES:
  Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica (AD) is a dermatologic manifestation associated with
  inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), distinct from acrodermatitis enteropathica,
  which occurs solely due to zinc deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: This report presents
  two pediatric cases: a 30-month-old girl with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) experiencing
  AD secondary to severe isoleucine deficiency due to a protein-restricted diet, showing
  improvement with dietary adjustments, and a 2.5-month-old boy infant with propionic
  acidemia (PA) who developed AD alongside septic shock, which progressed despite
  intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These cases emphasize the importance of identifying AD
  in IMDs and the critical need for meticulous monitoring of amino acid levels, as
  deficiencies may lead to severe complications.'
