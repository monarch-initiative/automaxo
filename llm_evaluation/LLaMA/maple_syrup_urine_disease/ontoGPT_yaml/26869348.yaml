input_text: "Living donor liver transplantation in maple syrup urine disease - Case
  series and world's youngest domino liver donor and recipient. MSUD occurs due to
  deficiency of enzyme BCKAD required for metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine
  leading to the accumulation of these and their ketoacids causing acute metabolic
  decompensation manifesting as encephalopathy or sudden death. The patient requires
  special protein-restricted diet to survive. As this enzyme is expressed in liver,
  liver transplantation has been successfully performed as a cure. We report two patients
  of MSUD who underwent LDLT while their livers were used as a domino graft for other
  biliary cirrhotic patients. A 22-month-old male child diagnosed as a case of classic
  MSUD underwent LDLT from an altruistic aunt as donor following which his serum leucine
  levels normalized on an unrestricted protein diet. His liver was used as a domino
  graft. A 38-month-old female child with diagnosed MSUD underwent LDLT from a swap
  donor, and her liver was used as a domino graft. Her DQ improved post-transplant.
  LDLT from non-heterozygous donors is a cure for classical MSUD. Their livers can
  be used as domino grafts for non-MSUD cases. "
