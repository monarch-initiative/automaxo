input_text: The first case of domino-split-liver transplantation in maple syrup urine
  disease. The enzymatic defect in MSUD results in accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites
  of BCAAs. LTX has shown to be a feasible strategy in patients non-responsive to
  diet. Because of sufficient enzyme activity in extrahepatic tissues in healthy people,
  the MSUD liver graft is a suitable domino organ. We present the first case of a
  technical challenging ex situ split of a MSUD domino organ transplanted into two
  pediatric recipients. The domino graft donor was a 21-year-old female (58 kg) suffering
  from MSUD with recurrent metabolic decompensation despite strict diet. The organ
  was allocated to a 14-year-old girl (55 kg) with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
  Due to excellent organ quality and suitable anatomy, a backward split for a girl
  of 3 months (5 kg) with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia was
  performed. The postoperative course was without relevant complications, and the
  three recipients were discharged on postoperative days 28, 29, and 45, respectively,
  with good organ function. BCAAs in plasma were normal in the two domino graft recipients,
  and the MSUD patient showed mildly elevated but stable BCAA concentrations despite
  an unrestricted diet. Split-domino LTX enabled successful transplantation of three
  patients of the waiting list with only one deceased donor graft.
