PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore, she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is a treatment option for PC deficiency. ",

Treatment for MSUD represents an unmet need because the current treatment with life-long low-protein diet is challenging to maintain, and despite treatment the risk of acute decompensations and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains. Here, based on significant liver contribution to the catabolism of the branched chain amino acid leucine, we develop a liver-directed adeno-associated virus (AAV8) gene therapy for MSUD. We establish and characterize the Bckdha (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase a)-/- mouse that exhibits a lethal neonatal phenotype mimicking human MSUD. Animals were treated at P0 with intravenous human BCKDHA AAV8 vectors under the control of either a ubiquitous or a liver-specific promoter. BCKDHA gene transfer rescued the lethal phenotype. While the use of a ubiquitous promoter fully and sustainably rescued the disease (long-term survival, normal phenotype and correction of biochemical abnormalities), liver-specific expression of BCKDHA led to partial, though sustained rescue. Here we show efficacy of gene therapy for MSUD demonstrating its potential for clinical translation.",

The present study evaluates efficiency and complications of CKRT in children with IEM. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with IEM who underwent CKRT in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units were analyzed. CKRT were initiated in patients with persistently high blood ammonia levels (>= 500 mumol/L), blood ammonia levels > 250 mumol/L in the presence of moderate encephalopathy, high blood leucine levels (>= 1500 mumol/L), and blood leucine levels < 1500 mumol/L in the presence of deteriorating neurological status or persistent metabolic acidosis. RESULTS: Of 22 patients enrolled, nine (40.9%) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), eight (36.4%) urea cycle disorders (UCD), and five (22.7%) organic acidemias (OA). Median age was 72.3 [9.9-1040.8] days. In total, 28 dialysis sessions were analyzed [16 (57.1%) continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and 12 (42.9%) continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration]. A significant decrease was noted in leucine levels (from 1608.4 +- 885.3 to 314.6 +- 109.9 micromol/L) of patients with MSUD, while ammonia levels were significantly decreased in patients with UCD and OA (from 1279.9 +- 612.1 to 85.1 +- 21.6 micromol/L). The most frequent complications of CKRT were thrombocytopenia (60.7%), hypotension (53.6%), and hypocalcemia (42.9%). Median age of patients with hypotension treated with vasoactive medications was significantly lower than median age of those with normal blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CKRT is a reliable approach for effective and rapid removal of toxic metabolites in children with IEM, and CKRT modalities can be safely used and are well-tolerated in infants.",

Despite its profound metabolic implications, the molecular alterations underlying this metabolic impairment had not yet been completely elucidated. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics integration analysis, including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from fibroblasts derived from a cohort of MSUD patients and unaffected controls to genetically characterize an MSUD case and to unravel the MSUD pathophysiology. MSUD patients exhibit a defined episignature that reshapes the global DNA methylation landscape, resulting in the stimulation of HOX cluster genes and the restriction of cell cycle gene-related signatures. Subsequent data integration revealed the impact of AP1-related and CEBPB transcription factors on the observed molecular reorganization, with MEIS1 emerging as a potential downstream candidate affected by robust epigenetic repression in MSUD patients. Furthermore, the integration of multi-omics layers facilitated the identification of a strong epigenetic repression in the DBT promoter in a patient wherein no BCKDH pathogenic variants had been detected. A Circular Chromatin Conformation Capture assay indicated a disturbance of the interactions of DBT promoter, thereby unveiling alternative modes of disease inheritance. Integration of multi-omics data unveiled underlying molecular networks rewired in MSUD patients and represents a powerful approach with diagnostic potential for rare genetic disorders with unknown genetic bases.",

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric tube insertion.",

Rapid elimination of these metabolites by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled staff and standard procedures.",

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

METHODS: The patients underwent continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: Eleven (68.75%) patients underwent CVVHDF and five (31.25%) underwent peritoneal dialysis. The median leucine reduction rate per hour was 2.56% (1.75-7.6) in the CVVHDF group, 0.78% (0.54-1.83) in the PD group, and was significantly higher in the CVVHDF group (p = 0.001). Posttreatment plasma leucine levels were found to be 198 (20-721) mumol/L in the CVVHDF group and 600 (250-967) mumol/L in the PD group, and CVVHDF was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.08). Complications such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and filter obstruction occurred in the CVVHDF group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CVVHDF is more effective than PD for rapidly eliminating elevated leucine levels caused by MSUD in the newborn and it is not associated with increased complication rates.",

This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

In view of the worldwide shortage of available organs for transplantation, heterozygote to homozygote transplantation in the setting of MSUD may provide a viable alternative for those awaiting transplantation. We report on the case of a two-yr-old infant with MSUD, who received a left lateral segment (segments II and III) liver transplant from his mother, a heterozygote carrier of one of the three abnormal genes implicated in MSUD. Post-operative BCAA levels normalized in our patient and remained so on an unrestricted protein diet and during times of physiological stress. To date, this is only the second case of a successful RLD liver transplant in a child with MSUD. Preliminary results indicate that RLD liver transplants are at least equivalent to deceased donor liver transplants in the treatment of MSUD, although longer term follow-up is required. Heterozygote to homozygote RLD transplant in patients with MSUD presents a new pool of potential liver donors. ",

BCKDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues in the absence of functional BCKDH. We evaluated a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based treatment approach to address all possible genetic mutations that can cause MSUD (BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT). In the intermediate MSUD mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH, repeated administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNA therapy significantly extended survival and reduced serum leucine levels. We also evaluated our LNP approach in several models of classic MSUD, namely DBT knockout (KO) mice and the new BCKDHA KO and BCKDHB KO mice. The latter two were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and contain the highly prevalent classic MSUD-causing mutations seen in the Mennonite and Costa Rican populations. Intravenous LNP-encapsulated mRNA administration extended survival and increased body weight in the DBT KO and BCKDHA KO models of classic MSUD but was not effective in BCKDHB KO mice. Our data provide a promising proof-of-concept that a universal, mutation-independent approach to treating MSUD is possible and viable.",

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an emergency option in affected newborns, mostly performed as ultima ratio. We report our 10-year experience using emergency RRT in newborns with UCD, OA and MSUD. Twelve newborns (eight with UCD, two with methylmalonic acidemia and two with MSUD) underwent emergency RRT. The overall survival rate to RRT was 58.3%. Hyperammonemic newborns required earlier RRT with respect to MSUD patients (75 (65-102) vs 301 (192-410) h of life, P < 0.01). Hyperammonemic neonates surviving (n = 5) and non-surviving (n = 5) the acute neonatal decompensation showed similar birth weight (P = 0.690), duration of intubation (P = 0.917), ammonia at onset (P = 0.916) and at the start of RRT (P = 0.426), age at RRT (P = 0.999) and duration of coma before RRT (P = 0.691). Remarkably, all survivors quickly responded to RRT, with ammonia concentration less than 300 mumol/L after 8 h of treatment. One patient with UCD successfully treated by neonatal RRT died at 4 months of life because of sepsis. All patients with MSUD had normalized leucine levels after 12 h of RRT, surviving the acute neonatal decompenstation. All long-term survivors (five liver transplanted, one waiting for liver transplantation) currently show normal or near-normal neurological development (48 +- 39 months of age). Early response to RRT was associated with survival irrespective of pre-treatment picture. RRT can be considered even in huge neonatal metabolic decompensations. Early liver transplantation may be an option for select patients.",

This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent 15 sessions of CVVHDF (age range 15 days to 87 months, mean 40.8 +- 31.4 months). One patient required additional CVVHDF 1 week after cessation of CVVHDF. Twenty seven percent (n = 4) of the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twelve patients responded to treatment and dramatic neurological improvement was observed within 24 h. Two of the 14 patients required 36 h of CVVHDF for neurological improvement. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 20.2 +- 8.6 (9-36) h.

Transplantation of liver from an unrelated deceased donor restores 9-13% whole-body BCKA oxidation capacity and stabilizes MSUD. Recent reports document encouraging short-term outcomes for MSUD patients who received a liver segment from mutation heterozygous living related donors (LRDT). To investigate effects of living related versus deceased unrelated grafts, we studied four Brazilian MSUD patients treated with LRDT who were followed for a mean 19 +- 12 postoperative months, and compared metabolic and clinical outcomes to 37 classical MSUD patients treated with deceased donor transplant. Patient and graft survival for LRDT were 100%. Three of 4 MSUD livers were successfully domino transplanted into non-MSUD subjects. Following LRDT, all subjects resumed a protein-unrestricted diet as mean plasma leucine decreased from 224 +- 306 muM to 143 +- 44 muM and allo-isoleucine decreased 91%. We observed no episodes of hyperleucinemia during 80 aggregate postoperative patient-months. Mean plasma leucine:isoleucine:valine concentration ratios were ~2:1:4 after deceased donor transplant compared to ~1:1:1.5 following LRDT, resulting in differences of predicted cerebral amino acid uptake. Mutant heterozygous liver segments effectively maintain steady-state BCAA and BCKA homeostasis on an unrestricted diet and during most catabolic states, but might have different metabolic effects than grafts from unrelated deceased donors. Neither living related nor deceased donor transplant affords complete protection from metabolic intoxication, but both strategies represent viable alternatives to nutritional management.",

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

Domino liver transplantation (DLT) has been one strategy to augment the supply of donor organs in cases of inborn errors of metabolism. One such disease is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an inherited disorder of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. METHODS: We report on the transplantation of a deceased donor liver into a patient with MSUD, and the sequential transplantation of the explanted liver into a patient with hemophilia A, HIV, hepatitis C, and a low priority on the transplant waiting list. RESULTS: At 30 months, the MSUD recipient has had significant correction of BCAA metabolism on a protein-unrestricted diet and no progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The DLT recipient has been cured of hemophilia and has normal BCAA homeostasis. This case provides further evidence that elective orthotopic liver transplantation for MSUD attenuates the disease with restoration of BCAA metabolism, and that DLT in this setting can achieve excellent results in ESLD patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible that domino grafts from patients with MSUD could be used in more conventional recipients, but additional studies and longer-term outcomes are needed to determine the validity of DLT in MSUD.",

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested.

This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

Despite the advances in medical nutrition therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death. It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development, BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino acids with free diet intake for growth and development.",

A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant.

One particularly innovative strategy is domino liver transplantation in which a select group of liver transplant recipients can donate their explanted native livers for use as liver grafts in other patients. Several hereditary metabolic diseases (such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy, maple syrup urine disease, and familial hypercholesterolemia) are caused by aberrant or deficient protein production in the liver, and these conditions can be cured with an orthotopic liver transplant. Although their native livers eventually caused severe systemic disease in these patients, these livers are otherwise structurally and functionally normal, and they have been used successfully in domino liver transplants for the past 15 years. This article will review the indications for donating or receiving a domino liver transplant, the surgical techniques necessary to perform these transplants, as well as the recently revealed long-term outcomes and risks of domino transplantation.",

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric tube insertion.",

                    "abstract": "Classic maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB) to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth, restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion. In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms of MSUD in humans.",

The most technically challenging part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.",

In this observational retrospective study, we assessed transfusion practices in pediatric patients undergoing liver transplantation at a single institution over the course of 9 years. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from patient medical records at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 2008 to June 2017 were included. Primary and secondary outcomes were volume of red blood cells (RBCs) transfused and mortality, respectively. RESULTS: From January 2008 to June 2017, there were 278 liver transplants in 271 patients. The number of primary transplants were 259, second retransplants 15, and third retransplants 4. Average age at transplantation was 6.9 years. Biliary atresia, maple syrup urine disease, urea cycle defect, and liver tumor were the leading indications accounting for 66 (23.7%), 45 (16.2%), 24 (8.6%), and 23 (8.3%) of transplants, respectively. Seventy-six cases (27.3%) did not require RBC transfusions. Among those transfused, 181 (89.6%) of the cases required <1 blood volume (BV). The median BV transfused among all cases was 0.21 (range, 0-9; Q1, 0; Q3, 0.45). There is a trend toward higher volume transfusions among infants (median, 0.46 BV) compared to children >12 months of age (0.12 BV). By diagnosis, the group requiring the highest median volume transfusion was patients with total parenteral nutrition-related liver failure (3.41 BV) followed by patients undergoing repeat transplants (0.6 BV). Comparison of primary versus repeat transplants shows a trend toward higher volume transfusions in third transplants (median, 2.71 BV), compared to second transplants (0.43 BV) and primary transplants (0.18 BV). Four of 271 patients (1.5%) died during admission involving liver transplantation. Nine of 271 patients (3.3%) died subsequently. Total mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to historically reported trends, evaluation of current transfusion practices reveals that most patients undergoing liver transplantation receive <1 BV of packed RBCs. More than 1 in 4 transplantations require no transfusion at all. Risk factors for greater transfusion need include younger age, total parenteral nutrition-related liver failure, and repeat transplantation.",

Routine screening of newborn with tandem mass spectroscopy on the third day of life may detect elevated branched-chain amino acids in blood before the appearance of encephalopathic symptoms in MSUD cases. If undiagnosed by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and management. Patients may also benefit from these investigations during the follow-up period. ",

This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

The most technically challenging part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

Rapid elimination of these metabolites by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled staff and standard procedures.",

If undiagnosed by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and management.
