Patients diagnosed with FA are more predisposed to develop oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and this risk increases in transplant patients. The clinical characteristics of the oral manifestations of SCC in this group of patients do not differ from the lesions present in patients without the disease; however, they can be diagnosed in young patients and less common locations, such as, for example, in the buccal mucosa. OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions in patients with FA. Thus, disclosing a series of cases with similar changes may be relevant to improving and refining the multidisciplinary team's clinical view of suspected SCC or oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), providing surveillance and timely management.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC.

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment for a variety of hematological diseases. Allogenic HSCT requires hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from matched donors and comes with cytotoxicity and mortality. Recent advances in genome modification of HSCs have demonstrated the possibility of using autologous HSCT-based gene therapy to alleviate hematologic symptoms in monogenic diseases, such as the inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). However, for FA and other BMF syndromes, insufficient HSC numbers with functional defects results in delayed hematopoietic recovery and increased risk of graft failure. We and others previously identified the adaptor protein LNK (SH2B3) as a critical negative regulator of murine HSC homeostasis. However, whether LNK controls human HSCs has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of LNK via lentiviral expression of miR30-based short hairpin RNAs results in robust expansion of transplantable human HSCs that provided balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Importantly, LNK depletion enhances cytokine-mediated JAK/STAT activation in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, we demonstrate that LNK depletion expands primary HSPCs associated with FA. In xenotransplant, engraftment of FANCD2-depleted FA-like HSCs was markedly improved by LNK inhibition. Finally, targeting LNK in primary bone marrow HSPCs from FA patients enhanced their colony forming potential in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of targeting LNK to expand HSCs to improve HSCT and HSCT-based gene therapy.",

Calcineurin inhibitors are medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH. Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation should be \"medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia\". The correct nomenclature related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate scientific communication and improve the treatment.",

Its easy design and wide applicability open up a variety of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of genetic diseases. Indeed, very promising approaches for the correction of hematological disorders have been developed in the recent years, based on the self-renewal and multipotent differentiation properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which make this cell subset the ideal target for gene therapy purposes. This technology has been applied in different congenital blood disorders, such as primary immunodeficiencies, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked chronic granulomatous disease or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia or severe congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing has been implemented successfully as a novel therapy for cancer immunotherapy, by the development of promising strategies such as the use of oncolytic viruses or adoptive cellular therapy to the chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Therefore, considering the variety of genes and mutations affected, we can take advantage of the different DNA repair mechanisms by CRISPR/Cas9 in different manners, from homology-directed repair to non-homologous-end-joining to the latest emerging technologies such as base and prime editing. Although the delivery systems into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are still the bottleneck of this technology, some of the advances in genome editing shown in this review have already reached a clinical stage and show very promising preliminary results.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

                    "abstract": "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure with unique phenotypes and predisposition to cancer. Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.",

METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model: P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425). In stratification analyses, Longer PFS is found in female, age <= 55 years old and non-smoking patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype, and patients with TT genotypes were significantly had longer OS in male, age >55 years old, non-smoking, squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV stratification. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype are contributed to better prognosis. FANCE rs6907678 may be used as a clinical biomarker for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.",

Of the 31 patients with SAA, 19 had acquired aplastic anemia, 2 had Diamond Blackfan anemia and 10 had Fanconi anemia. Donors were either matched sibling (n=29), related donors (n=2), or unrelated donors (n=3). Peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source in all the cases except 1. Fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning was used in all except for patients with a diagnosis of Diamond Blackfan anemia. All patients except 1 achieved hematologic recovery in the form of neutrophil engraftment at 13 days (range, 9 to 17), whereas platelet engraftment occurred at 14 days (range, 10 to 18). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate +-antithymocyte globulin (horse/rabbit). Acute GvHD developed in 12.9% patients, whereas no patients developed chronic GvHD till the time of last follow-up. The 2-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 93.21+-4.6%.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA, via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+ cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION: Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.",

In this study, we explored interventions designed to further enhance in vivo hepatocyte gene repair in a model of hereditary tyrosinemia. A two-AAV system was employed: one virus carried a Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) expression cassette and the other harbored a U6 promoter-driven sgRNA and a fragment of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) genomic DNA as the homologous recombination donor. In neonatal mice, a gene correction frequency of ~10.8% of hepatocytes was achieved. The efficiency in adult mice was significantly lower at ~1.6%. To determine whether hepatocyte replication could enhance the targeting frequency, cell division was induced with thyroid hormone T3. This more than doubled the gene correction efficiency to 3.5% (p < 0.005). To determine whether SpCas9 delivery was rate limiting, the gene repair AAV was administered to SpCas9 transgenic mice. However, this did not significantly enhance gene repair. Finally, we tested whether the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway was important in hepatocyte gene repair. Gene correction frequencies were significantly lower in neonatal mice lacking the FA complementation group A (Fanca) gene. Taken together, we conclude that pharmacological induction of hepatocyte replication along with manipulation of DNA repair pathways could be a useful strategy for enhancing in vivo gene correction.",

This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

Although results have improved over the last decades, reaching more than 90% survival when a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is available, alternative HCT donors are still less reported. We compared HCT outcomes using HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD; n = 123) or haplo-identical donors (HDs), either using only in vivo T cell depletion (n = 33) or T cells depleted in vivo with some type of graft manipulation ex vivo (n = 59) performed for FA between 2000 and 2018. Overall survival (OS) by 24 months was 62% (53-71%) for MMUD, versus 80% (66-95%) for HDs with only in vivo T cell depletion and 60% (47-73%) for HDs with in vivo and ex vivo T cell depletion (p = .22). Event-free survival (EFS) was better for HD-transplanted FA patients with only in vivo T cell depletion 86% (73-99%) than for those transplanted from a MMUD 58% (48-68%) or those with graft manipulation 56% (42-69%) (p = .046). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41% (MMUD) versus 40% (HDs with no graft manipulation) versus 17% (HDs with T cell depleted graft), (p = .005). No differences were found for the other transplant related outcomes. These data suggest that HDs might be considered as an alternative option for FA patients with better EFS using unmanipulated grafts.",

Oral leukoplakia (OL) is frequent in FA patients and lacks a defined treatment. High-power diode lasers (HPDL) offer precise, minimally invasive ablation with favorable healing. This paper reports HPDL use in OL management in FA patients. CASE REPORT: Four FA patients (1742 years) with clinically and histologically confirmed OL underwent HPDL ablation (808 nm, 1.52 W). Lesions were removed with a 0.5 mm safety margin. All cases showed good healing, no recurrences within 1218 months, and minimal discomfort. Two lesions had dysplasia; one patient had prior SCC. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: HPDL showed favorable short-term outcomes for OL in FA patients. Though limited by small sample and follow-up, the approach may delay malignant transformation. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term benefits.",

The data show that, unlike patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reservoir of patients with DBA was not significantly reduced, suggesting that collection of these cells should not constitute a remarkable restriction for DBA gene therapy. Subsequently, 2 clinically applicable lentiviral vectors were developed. In the former lentiviral vector, PGK.CoRPS19 LV, a codon-optimized version of RPS19 was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) already used in different gene therapy trials, including FA gene therapy. In the latter one, EF1alpha.CoRPS19 LV, RPS19 expression was driven by the elongation factor alpha short promoter, EF1alpha(s). Preclinical experiments showed that transduction of DBA patient CD34+ cells with the PGK.CoRPS19 LV restored erythroid differentiation, and demonstrated the long-term repopulating properties of corrected DBA CD34+ cells, providing evidence of improved erythroid maturation. Concomitantly, long-term restoration of ribosomal biogenesis was verified using a potentially novel method applicable to patients' blood cells, based on ribosomal RNA methylation analyses. Finally, in vivo safety studies and proviral insertion site analyses showed that lentivirus-mediated gene therapy was nontoxic.",

Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.",

Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM). In the pediatric group, TCD was a borderline MVP (P = 0.059) with 5-year OS of 73.0% in TCD vs. 100% for T-replete HCT. The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete 3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT.

With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course.

Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.",

                    "abstract": "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) encompass a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, non-hematologic multisystemic comorbidities, disease defining congenital anomalies, and a susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and in some instances solid tumors. The most common IBMFS include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and telomere biology disorders/ dyskeratosis congenita. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.",

Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM). In the pediatric group, TCD was a borderline MVP (P = 0.059) with 5-year OS of 73.0% in TCD vs. 100% for T-replete HCT. The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete 3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT. Survival chances after HCT for FA are excellent and associated with high engrafted survival and low toxicity. Age >=19, HLA mismatch, year of transplant and 'TCD in the <19 years group' (although borderline) were found to be negative predictors for survival.",

Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.",

Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years).

Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests.

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in chimeric populations of corrected and uncorrected HSPCs coexisting in the BM of gene therapy treated FA patients. Our study demonstrates that gene therapy reverts the transcriptional signature of FA HSPCs, which then resembles the transcriptional program of healthy donor HSPCs. This includes a downregulated expression of TGF-beta and p21, typically upregulated in FA HSPCs, and upregulation of DNA damage response and telomere maintenance pathways.

Most FA patients will suffer bone marrow failure and the main treatment relies on supportive measures or more recently on the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The improvements seen in the management of FA has led women to reach childbearing age and have successful pregnancies. However, these pregnancies are associated with increased complications such as preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, eclampsia and others.Areas covered: This review highlights on the outcome of pregnancies in FA patients reported in the literature along with practical recommendations.Expert opinion: Multidisciplinary efforts are required to optimize the management of pregnancy in FA patients.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.",

Although results have improved over the last decades, reaching more than 90% survival when a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor is available, alternative HCT donors are still less reported. We compared HCT outcomes using HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD; n = 123) or haplo-identical donors (HDs), either using only in vivo T cell depletion (n = 33) or T cells depleted in vivo with some type of graft manipulation ex vivo (n = 59) performed for FA between 2000 and 2018. Overall survival (OS) by 24 months was 62% (53-71%) for MMUD, versus 80% (66-95%) for HDs with only in vivo T cell depletion and 60% (47-73%) for HDs with in vivo and ex vivo T cell depletion (p = .22). Event-free survival (EFS) was better for HD-transplanted FA patients with only in vivo T cell depletion 86% (73-99%) than for those transplanted from a MMUD 58% (48-68%) or those with graft manipulation 56% (42-69%) (p = .046). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41% (MMUD) versus 40% (HDs with no graft manipulation) versus 17% (HDs with T cell depleted graft), (p = .005). No differences were found for the other transplant related outcomes. These data suggest that HDs might be considered as an alternative option for FA patients with better EFS using unmanipulated grafts.",

Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM).

The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete 3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT.

As reverse genetic mosaicism has been described as \"natural gene therapy\" in patients with FA, we sought to evaluate the clinical course of a cohort of FA mosaic patients followed at referral centers in Spain over a 30-year period. This cohort includes patients with a majority of T cells without chromosomal aberrations in the DEB-chromosomal breakage test. Relative to non-mosaic FA patients, we observed a higher proportion of adult patients in the cohort of mosaics, with a later age of hematologic onset and a milder evolution of (BMF). Consequently, the requirement for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was also lower. Additional studies allowed us to identify a sub-cohort of mosaic FA patients in whom the reversion was present in bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells leading to multilineage mosaicism. These multilineage mosaic patients are older, have a lower percentage of aberrant cells, have more stable hematology and none of them developed leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome when compared to non-mosaics. In conclusion, our data indicate that reverse mosaicism is a good prognostic factor in FA and is associated with more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

The FANCA gene is the most commonly pathogenic gene, accounting for more than 60% of all causative genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: The clinical case is a 3-year-old boy showed mild anemia and scattered bleeding spots the size of a needle tip all over his body. DIAGNOSES: Compound heterozygous mutation was identified in the FANCA gene in the FA case: c.1A > T from the father in exon 1; the deletion of chr16: 89857810-89858476 (exon13-14 del) from the mother; finally, the patient was diagnosed as Fanconi anemia. INTERVENTION: After diagnosis, the child received chemotherapy (Ara-C + Flu + Cy + ATG). Then, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and unrelated umbilical cord blood transfusion were performed. OUTCOMES: The child is recovering well and is in regular follow-up. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The discovery of new mutations in the FANCA gene enriches the genetic profile of FA and helps clinicians to further understand this disease and guide genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing FA.",

                    "abstract": "The discovery of the structure of DNA and the mechanisms that regulate gene expression during the first half of the last century established the theoretical and methodological bases for the development of technology that makes it possible to modify a gene or a genome. The clinical application of techniques that modify the expression of a gene is called gene therapy (GT). These techniques include platforms (viral and non-viral) that bring genetic modification systems or healthy genes to the target cells. ClinicalTrial.gov is a repository of clinical trials that incorporates protocols using TG. In this work, a systematic review of the works registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on the use of TG in hematological diseases was carried out. A total of 41 GT-related clinical trials were found most of which were registered in the United States of America (56.1%). On the other hand, 41.46% of the protocols obtained private funding. Of 50% of all pathologies, only diseases of hematological origin of monogenic origin (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Fanconi anemia) received TG. On the other hand, the number of clinical protocols registered by country was positively correlated with economic development, scientific development, investment in health per capita, and quality of life. Finally, there are still many bioethical, social, political, and economic controversies that must be solved.",
