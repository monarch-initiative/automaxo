The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic pathology.",
