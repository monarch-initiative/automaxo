Individuals with FA have increased susceptibility to congenital anomalies, progressive bone marrow failure, leukemia and malignant tumors, endocrinopathies and other medical issues. In recent decades, steadily improved approaches to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only proven curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of FA, have significantly increased the life expectancy of affected individuals, illuminating the need to understand the long-term consequences and multi-organ ramifications. Utilizing a systematized review approach with narrative synthesis of each primary issue and organ system, we shed light on the challenges and opportunities for optimizing the care and quality of life for individuals with FA and identify knowledge gaps informing future research directions.",
