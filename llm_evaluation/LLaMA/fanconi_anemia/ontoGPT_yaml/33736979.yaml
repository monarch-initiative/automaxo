input_text: 'Role of gene therapy in Fanconi anemia: A systematic and literature review
  with future directions. Gene therapy (GT) has been reported to improve bone marrow
  function in individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA); however, its clinical application
  is still in the initial stages. We conducted this systematic review, following the
  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines,
  to assess the long-term safety and clinical outcomes of GT in FA patients. Electronic
  searches from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were
  conducted and full texts of articles meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed.
  Three clinical trials were included, with a total of nine patients and mean age
  of 10.7 +- 5.7 years. All patients had lentiviral-mediated GT. A 1-year follow-up
  showed stabilization in blood lineages, without any serious adverse effects from
  GT. A metaregression analysis could not be conducted, as very little long-term follow-up
  data of patients was observed, and the median survival rate could not be calculated.
  Thus, we can conclude that GT seems to be a safe procedure in FA; however, further
  research needs to be conducted on the longitudinal clinical effects of GT in FA,
  for a better insight into its potential to become a standard form of treatment.'
