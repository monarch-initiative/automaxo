input_text: 'Mixed chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  for severe aplastic anemia. A retrospective study on 287 patients with SAA who underwent
  allo-HSCT between October 2012 and January 2020 was conducted to explore the outcomes,
  risk factors and treatment options for MC. Among 287 AA patients who excluded Fanconi
  anemia (FA), Congenital dyskeratosis (DKC), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
  (PNH), etc.112 underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, 91 matched unrelated
  donor-HSCT and 84 haploidentical-HSCT. Patients were divided into the following
  4 groups: group 1: Donor chimerism (DC); group 2: MC without cytopenia; group 3:
  MC with cytopenia; group 4: secondary graft failure (SGF). Compared with the other
  three groups, SGF predicted a poor prognosis of SAA (P< 0.001). In addition, SGF
  was associated with the early (within 3 months after transplantation) presence of
  MC and the high levels of MC. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis
  showed that donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen were high-risk
  factors for MC. Of note, in MC patients with cytopenia (group 3), the effective
  response rate reached 55% (6/11) following enhanced immunosuppression combined with
  cellular therapy, while only one of the four was effective who received enhanced
  immunosuppression alone. SGF was associated with poor prognosis, early presence
  of MC and increased levels of recipient chimerism. The donor/recipient sex-mismatching
  and CTX + ATG regimen based MSD-HSCT were risk factors for MC. Cellular therapy
  could improve the effective response rate of patients with progressive MC.'
