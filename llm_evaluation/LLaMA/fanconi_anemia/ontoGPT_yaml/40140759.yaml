input_text: "Effective management of pediatric septic shock: a case study utilizing
  continuous renal replacement therapy with cytosorb and citrate in a leukemic patient
  with hyper-interleukin (IL)-6-naemia and severe thrombocytopenia. BACKGROUND: Sepsis
  is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection,
  often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory
  cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored
  the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in
  managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated
  IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented
  with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following
  the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications,
  including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such
  as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated.
  CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's
  clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant
  because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which
  the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated
  a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels
  at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited
  marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization
  of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy.
  CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable
  adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction
  in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent
  antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced
  the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate
  the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and
  safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.
