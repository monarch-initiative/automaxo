input_text: 'In-depth Clinical and Biological Exploration of DNA Damage Immune Response
  as a Biomarker for Oxaliplatin Use in Colorectal Cancer. PURPOSE: The DNA damage
  immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated
  with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive
  DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies
  in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker
  to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict
  response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized
  the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and
  clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received
  either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid)
  plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant
  FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation,
  and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal
  cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a
  trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive
  patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and
  colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping
  IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal
  cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not
  have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
  DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment
  in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the
  DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint
  blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.'
