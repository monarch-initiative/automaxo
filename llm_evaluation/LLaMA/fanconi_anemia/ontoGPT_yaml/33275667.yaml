input_text: Special pre- and posttransplant considerations in inherited bone marrow
  failure and hematopoietic malignancy predisposition syndromes. Advances in the diagnosis
  and treatment of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) have provided insight
  into the complexity of these diseases. The diseases are heterogeneous and characterized
  by developmental abnormalities, progressive marrow failure, and predisposition to
  cancer. A correct diagnosis allows for appropriate treatment, genetic counseling,
  and cancer surveillance. The common IBMFSs are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita,
  and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers curative
  treatment of the hematologic complications of IBMFS. Because of the systemic nature
  of these diseases, transplant strategies are modified to decrease immediate and
  late toxicities. HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors offers excellent
  survival for young patients in aplasia. Challenges include the treatment of adults
  with marrow aplasia, presentation with myeloid malignancy regardless of age, and
  early detection or treatment of cancer. In this article, I will describe our approach
  and evaluation of patients transplanted with IBMFS and review most frequent complications
  before and after transplant.
