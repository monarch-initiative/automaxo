input_text: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. A promising strategy in hematological
  disorders. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9
  system has revolutionized the gene editing field, making it possible to interrupt,
  insert or replace a sequence of interest with high precision in the human genome.
  Its easy design and wide applicability open up a variety of therapeutic alternatives
  for the treatment of genetic diseases. Indeed, very promising approaches for the
  correction of hematological disorders have been developed in the recent years, based
  on the self-renewal and multipotent differentiation properties of hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells, which make this cell subset the ideal target for gene
  therapy purposes. This technology has been applied in different congenital blood
  disorders, such as primary immunodeficiencies, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency,
  X-linked chronic granulomatous disease or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and inherited
  bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic
  thrombocytopenia or severe congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based
  gene editing has been implemented successfully as a novel therapy for cancer immunotherapy,
  by the development of promising strategies such as the use of oncolytic viruses
  or adoptive cellular therapy to the chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Therefore,
  considering the variety of genes and mutations affected, we can take advantage of
  the different DNA repair mechanisms by CRISPR/Cas9 in different manners, from homology-directed
  repair to non-homologous-end-joining to the latest emerging technologies such as
  base and prime editing. Although the delivery systems into hematopoietic stem and
  progenitor cells are still the bottleneck of this technology, some of the advances
  in genome editing shown in this review have already reached a clinical stage and
  show very promising preliminary results.
