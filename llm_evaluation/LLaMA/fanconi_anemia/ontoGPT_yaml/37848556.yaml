input_text: Predictors of outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation for Fanconi
  anemia. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the only cure
  for the hematologic manifestations of Fanconi anemia (FA). We performed retrospective
  predictor analyses for HCT outcomes in FA for pediatric and young adult patients
  transplanted between 2007 and 2020 across three large referral institutions. Eighty-nine
  patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML,
  were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival
  (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors
  (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM). In the pediatric group,
  TCD was a borderline MVP (P = 0.059) with 5-year OS of 73.0% in TCD vs. 100% for
  T-replete HCT. The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year
  cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred
  in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete
  3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT. Survival chances after
  HCT for FA are excellent and associated with high engrafted survival and low toxicity.
  Age >=19, HLA mismatch, year of transplant and 'TCD in the <19 years group' (although
  borderline) were found to be negative predictors for survival.
