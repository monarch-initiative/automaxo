input_text: 'Unveiling Immunotherapy Evasion in Lung Cancer: The Role of Fanconi Anemia
  and Stemness Genes in Shaping an Immunosuppressive Microenvironment. The study aimed
  to investigate the fanconi anemia (FA)-related and stemness-related genes in lung
  cancer (LC) patients. Firstly, we identified stemness-related genes through weighted
  gene co-expression network analysis combined with TCGA database. Further combined
  stemness-related genes with FA-related genes to screen for prognostic-related genes.
  Risk score was constructed from the screened genes and comprehensive bioinformatics
  analyses were performed. Finally, single-cell data and in vitro experiment were
  used to validate our results. We screened a total of eight genes to construct a
  risk score. The risk score was an independent prognostic factor for LC. The validation
  results of multiple GEO databases were consistent with our results. Functional and
  pathway enrichment analysis showed that risk score was associated with cell cycle,
  DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and immune-related pathways. The results showed
  to be related to the stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Besides, we also
  found that patients with higher risk scores had lower immune activity and function,
  and the effectiveness of immunotherapy might be poorer, with a higher rate of immune
  escape. Finally, our results revealed that SLC2A1 had the highest correlation with
  B cells in single-cell data analysis, and we validated its correlation with B cells
  and its expression with FA-related genes, tumor invasiveness, stemness, and drug
  sensitivity. Our research constructed a risk score based on FA-related and tumor
  stemness-related specific genes. In addition to accurately predicting the prognosis
  of patients with LC, the risk score may also serve as an innovative and viable predictor
  of immunotherapy response.'
