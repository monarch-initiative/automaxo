input_text: Modern management of Fanconi anemia. In this review, we present a clinical
  case report and discussion to outline the importance of long-term specific Fanconi
  anemia (FA) monitoring, and we discuss the main aspects of the general management
  of patients with FA and clinical complications. While several nontransplant treatments
  are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains
  the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes
  in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition
  to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates
  the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed
  in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion
  dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia);
  hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very
  good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored.
  A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck
  carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers
  the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high
  numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive
  monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management,
  that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is
  essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.
