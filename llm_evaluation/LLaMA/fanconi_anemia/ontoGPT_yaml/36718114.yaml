input_text: 'Unrelated Donor Cord Blood Transplantation in Children: Lessons Learned
  Over 3 Decades. Four decades ago, Broxmeyer et al. demonstrated that umbilical cord
  blood (CB) contained hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hypothesized that CB could
  be used as a source of donor HSC for rescue of myeloablated bone marrow. In 1988,
  Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant
  (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an
  unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this
  bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes
  of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor.
  We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted
  outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord
  and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit
  (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival
  [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD],
  treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2:
  2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree
  of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved
  over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse
  remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant
  outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than
  cell dose in this pediatric cohort.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
