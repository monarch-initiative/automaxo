input_text: 'Longitudinal clinical manifestations of Fanconi anemia: A systematized
  review. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare and complex inherited genetic disorder characterized
  by impaired DNA repair mechanisms leading to genomic instability. Individuals with
  FA have increased susceptibility to congenital anomalies, progressive bone marrow
  failure, leukemia and malignant tumors, endocrinopathies and other medical issues.
  In recent decades, steadily improved approaches to hematopoietic cell transplantation
  (HCT), the only proven curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of FA,
  have significantly increased the life expectancy of affected individuals, illuminating
  the need to understand the long-term consequences and multi-organ ramifications.
  Utilizing a systematized review approach with narrative synthesis of each primary
  issue and organ system, we shed light on the challenges and opportunities for optimizing
  the care and quality of life for individuals with FA and identify knowledge gaps
  informing future research directions.'
