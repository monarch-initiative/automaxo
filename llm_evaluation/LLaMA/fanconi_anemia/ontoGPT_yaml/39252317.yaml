input_text: 'Clinical and genetic features of Fanconi anemia associated with a variant
  of FANCA gene: Case report and literature review. RATIONALE: Fanconi anemia (FA)
  is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the genes involved in the DNA damage
  repair pathway. The FANCA gene is the most commonly pathogenic gene, accounting
  for more than 60% of all causative genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: The clinical case is
  a 3-year-old boy showed mild anemia and scattered bleeding spots the size of a needle
  tip all over his body. DIAGNOSES: Compound heterozygous mutation was identified
  in the FANCA gene in the FA case: c.1A > T from the father in exon 1; the deletion
  of chr16: 89857810-89858476 (exon13-14 del) from the mother; finally, the patient
  was diagnosed as Fanconi anemia. INTERVENTION: After diagnosis, the child received
  chemotherapy (Ara-C + Flu + Cy + ATG). Then, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  and unrelated umbilical cord blood transfusion were performed. OUTCOMES: The child
  is recovering well and is in regular follow-up. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The discovery
  of new mutations in the FANCA gene enriches the genetic profile of FA and helps
  clinicians to further understand this disease and guide genetic counseling and prenatal
  diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing FA.'
