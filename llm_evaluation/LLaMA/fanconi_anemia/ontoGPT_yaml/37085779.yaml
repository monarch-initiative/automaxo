input_text: 'Pathological evaluation of renal complications in children following
  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective cohort study.
  BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a
  curative therapy for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant disorders, such
  as aplastic anemia, fanconi anemia, and certain immune deficiencies. Post-transplantation
  kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide spectrum of structural
  abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis;
  FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis;
  MCD, minimal change disease), vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or
  tubulointerstitial (TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury).
  Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of
  kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little
  is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients.
  METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney
  injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10
  years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria
  indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d),
  nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <
  30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT).
  The main pathologies identified from kidney biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n
  = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD (n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF,
  n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or combined with other pathologies. The median
  follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy
  and/or severe infection, one child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD),
  six patients (24%) had elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100micromol/l) and nine
  patients (36%) still had proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates histomorphologic
  findings from kidney biopsies of pediatric recipients following allo-HSCT. Detailed
  evaluation of renal biopsy samples is helpful to elucidate the nature of renal insult,
  and may potentially identify treatable disease processes.'

  Note that some relationships could not be precisely annotated due to the lack of specific information about treatments or chemicals used. Additionally, some disease terms could be considered both as primary disease and symptoms (e.g., kidney injury). 

  Here is an updated version with a focus on kidney injury as primary disease:

  medical_actions: renal biopsy; kidney replacement therapy (KRT)

  symptoms: proteinuria; nephrotic syndrome; reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); elevated serum creatinine (SCr); end-stage renal disease (ESRD); MSPGN; FSGS; MPGN; TMA; MCD; diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF); ATI; TIN

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS).
