input_text: 'Post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant squamous cell carcinoma in patients
  with Fanconi anemia: a dreadful enemy. INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) is a curative option for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and hematological
  manifestations but it does not prevent solid tumors, especially squamous cell carcinomas
  (SCC). METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and
  had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was
  15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative
  incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively.
  One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in
  cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in
  all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly
  tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary
  programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.'
