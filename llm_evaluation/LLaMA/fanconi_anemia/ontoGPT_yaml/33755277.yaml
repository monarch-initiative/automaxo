input_text: Bone marrow transplant using fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning
  regimen with in vivo T cell depletion in patients with Fanconi anemia. FA is the
  most common cause of inherited BMF syndromes. The only cure for BMF in FA remains
  HSCT. Due to DNA instability in FA, RIC has been used to decrease immediate and
  late complications of HSCT. Most FA conditioning regimens in mismatched and unrelated
  donor transplants rely on TBI, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies.
  Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach,
  but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate
  the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with
  in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed
  on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant
  with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning
  and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent
  MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan
  and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic
  GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At
  last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with
  stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab
  can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of
  developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.
