input_text: 'Beyond current treatment of Fanconi Anemia: What do advances in cell
  and gene-based approaches offer? Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disorder
  that mainly affects the bone marrow. This condition causes decreased production
  of all types of blood cells. FA is caused by a defective repair of DNA interstrand
  crosslinks and to date, mutations in over 20 genes have been linked to the disease.
  Advances in science and molecular biology have provided new insight between FA gene
  mutations and the severity of clinical manifestations. Here, we will highlight the
  current and promising therapeutic options for this rare disease. The current standard
  treatment for FA patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a treatment
  associated to exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, immunological complications,
  plus opportunistic infections from prolonged immune incompetence or increased risk
  of morbidity. New arising treatments include gene addition therapy, genome editing
  using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, and hematopoietic stem cell generation from induced
  pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we will also discuss the revolutionary developments
  in mRNA therapeutics as an opportunity for this disease.'
