input_text: Fanconi Anemia in a 31-Year-Old Patient with Multiple Malignant Tumor
  Foci, Including Appendiceal Cancer, and Multiple Coexisting Pathologies. BACKGROUND
  Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that impairs the function of the bone
  marrow and predisposes individuals to aplastic anemia. The condition is caused by
  mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased
  risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck,
  esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT
  A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation
  was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA
  marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia,
  kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed
  a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic
  conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.
  During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus,
  numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring
  4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix
  with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis
  confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative
  treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous
  type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive
  cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone
  marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical
  importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic
  pathology.
