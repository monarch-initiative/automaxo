input_text: Gonadal function in pediatric Fanconi anemia patients treated with hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant. Gonadal dysfunction and reduced fertility are clinical manifestations
  well described in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and following hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is difficult to differentiate gonadal dysfunction
  from the primary disease itself or from HSCT procedures. Therefore, it is important
  to manage expectations about gonadal failure and infertility for all patients with
  FA, regardless of HSCT status. We performed a retrospective analysis of 98 pediatric
  patients with FA who were transplanted between July 1990 to June 2020 to evaluate
  the incidence of gonadal dysfunction in female and male patients with FA. New onset
  premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) was diagnosed in a total of 30 (52.6%) patients.
  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased
  in patients diagnosed with POI. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels declined in
  POI patients after HSCT (r2 = 0.21, p = 0.001). Twenty (48.8%) male patients were
  diagnosed with testicular failure. FSH levels increased after HSCT even in patients
  without testicular failure (r2=0.17, p=0.005). Inhibin B levels decreased over time
  after HSCT in patients with testicular failure (r2 = 0.14, p = 0.001). These data
  indicate brisk decline in already impaired gonadal function in transplanted children
  with FA.
