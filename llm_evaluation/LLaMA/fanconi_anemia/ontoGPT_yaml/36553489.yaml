input_text: "In Vivo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Genome Editing: Perspectives and Limitations.
  The tremendous evolution of genome-editing tools in the last two decades has provided
  innovative and effective approaches for gene therapy of congenital and acquired
  diseases. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator- like effector nucleases
  (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 have been already applied by ex vivo hematopoietic stem
  cell (HSC) gene therapy in genetic diseases (i.e., Hemoglobinopathies, Fanconi anemia
  and hereditary Immunodeficiencies) as well as infectious diseases (i.e., HIV), and
  the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems using base and prime editors
  as well as epigenome editors has provided safer tools for gene therapy. The ex vivo
  approach for gene addition or editing of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically
  challenging, costly and not free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise
  to transform gene therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a \"user-friendly'
  approach to eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially
  affordable treatment modality. In the present review article, based on the lessons
  gained by more than 3 decades of ex vivo HSC gene therapy, we discuss the concept,
  the tools, the progress made and the challenges to clinical translation of in vivo
  HSC gene editing."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
