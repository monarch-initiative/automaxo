input_text: 'Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Offer Good Outcomes in
  Pediatric Aplastic Anemia: Experience From Developing World. Between 2014 and 2020,
  31 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent full match allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation at our center. Of the 31 patients with SAA, 19 had acquired
  aplastic anemia, 2 had Diamond Blackfan anemia and 10 had Fanconi anemia. Donors
  were either matched sibling (n=29), related donors (n=2), or unrelated donors (n=3).
  Peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source in all the cases except 1. Fludarabine-based
  reduced intensity conditioning was used in all except for patients with a diagnosis
  of Diamond Blackfan anemia. All patients except 1 achieved hematologic recovery
  in the form of neutrophil engraftment at 13 days (range, 9 to 17), whereas platelet
  engraftment occurred at 14 days (range, 10 to 18). Graft versus host disease (GvHD)
  prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate +-antithymocyte globulin
  (horse/rabbit). Acute GvHD developed in 12.9% patients, whereas no patients developed
  chronic GvHD till the time of last follow-up. The 2-year overall survival for the
  entire cohort was 93.21+-4.6%. In patients with SAA, allogeneic stem cell transplant
  using fludarabine-based conditioning regimens are very well tolerated and have excellent
  outcomes in a full match setting.'
