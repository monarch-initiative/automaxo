input_text: Lentivirus-mediated gene therapy corrects ribosomal biogenesis and shows
  promise for Diamond Blackfan anemia. This study lays the groundwork for future lentivirus-mediated
  gene therapy in patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) caused by mutations
  in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), showing evidence of a new safe and effective therapy.
  The data show that, unlike patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the hematopoietic
  stem cell (HSC) reservoir of patients with DBA was not significantly reduced, suggesting
  that collection of these cells should not constitute a remarkable restriction for
  DBA gene therapy. Subsequently, 2 clinically applicable lentiviral vectors were
  developed. In the former lentiviral vector, PGK.CoRPS19 LV, a codon-optimized version
  of RPS19 was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) already used in
  different gene therapy trials, including FA gene therapy. In the latter one, EF1alpha.CoRPS19
  LV, RPS19 expression was driven by the elongation factor alpha short promoter, EF1alpha(s).
  Preclinical experiments showed that transduction of DBA patient CD34+ cells with
  the PGK.CoRPS19 LV restored erythroid differentiation, and demonstrated the long-term
  repopulating properties of corrected DBA CD34+ cells, providing evidence of improved
  erythroid maturation. Concomitantly, long-term restoration of ribosomal biogenesis
  was verified using a potentially novel method applicable to patients' blood cells,
  based on ribosomal RNA methylation analyses. Finally, in vivo safety studies and
  proviral insertion site analyses showed that lentivirus-mediated gene therapy was
  nontoxic.
