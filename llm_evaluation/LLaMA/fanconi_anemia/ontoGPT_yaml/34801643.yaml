input_text: Translational research for bone marrow failure patients. Bone marrow failure
  syndromes encompass a range of inherited and acquired hematological diseases that
  result in insufficient blood cell production, which leads to severe complications
  including anemia, weakening of the immune system, impaired coagulation, and increased
  risk of cancer. Within inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a number of genetically
  distinct diseases have been described including Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and Fanconi
  anemia. Given the genetic complexity and poor prognosis of these inherited bone
  marrow failure syndromes, there is increasing interest in both characterizing the
  genetic landscapes of these diseases and developing novel gene therapies to effectively
  monitor and cure patients. These topics were the focus of the winter 2021 International
  Society for Experimental Hematology New Investigator Webinar, which featured presentations
  by Dr. Akiko Shimamura and Dr. Paula Rio. Here, we review the topics covered within
  this webinar.
