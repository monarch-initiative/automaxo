input_text: 'Ocular Manifestations in Patients with Fanconi Anemia: A Single-Center
  Experience Including 106 Patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of acquired
  ocular manifestations in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and to describe and correlate
  the congenital ocular malformations with the genetic subtypes of the disease. STUDY
  DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional observational study of 106 consecutive patients
  with confirmed diagnosis of FA who were followed at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell
  Transplantation (HSCT) Service at the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Parana,
  Brazil. Participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation and 84 patients
  underwent ocular ultrasound examination. This study was conducted between November
  2014 and August 2017. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 43 years
  of age. Microphthalmia was the most common congenital ocular abnormality (95.2%).
  A decrease in anthropometric measurements was observed, including palpebral fissure
  length (78/103 patients [76.5%]), microcornea (48/103 patients [46.6%]), and ptosis
  (31/103 patients [30.1%]). We identified a new ophthalmic condition in 15 patients
  with FA, that is, epiretinal tissue on the optic disc. The genetic subtype was identified
  in 78 patients (79.6%), the FA-A subtype was most prevalent (50%). The most common
  acquired ocular manifestation (non-graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] related) in
  patients who did not undergo HSCT (n = 44) was limbal neovascularization (13.6%),
  whereas in patients who underwent HSCT (n = 62), the GVHD-related manifestation
  was ocular GVHD (51.6%). The most frequent symptom of ocular GVHD was keratoconjunctivitis
  sicca (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Several ocular manifestations were identified in patients
  with FA.'

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
