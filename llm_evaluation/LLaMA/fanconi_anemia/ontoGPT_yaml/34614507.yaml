input_text: Graft rejection markers in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant
  for bone marrow failure. Graft rejection (GR) is a poorly understood complication
  of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). GR risk factors are well published, but
  there are no reliable biomarkers or therapies known. Fever is the most common symptom
  of GR, but no study has evaluated fever kinetics as a diagnostic marker of GR. The
  objectives of this study were to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential
  therapies for GR after HCT. Chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), B-cell activating factor
  (BAFF), and complement markers (sC5b-9, C3a, and C5a) were measured in 7 patients
  with GR and compared with 15 HCT controls. All patients had a diagnosis of aplastic
  anemia, Fanconi anemia, or genetically undefined chromosomal fragility syndrome.
  All patients with GR were febrile during GR; therefore, control patients who underwent
  HCT were matched for diagnosis and early fevers after HCT. Patients withh GR had
  significantly higher CXCL9, BAFF, and sC5b-9 at the time of fever and GR compared
  with control patients who underwent HCT at the time of fever. The maximum fever
  was significantly higher and occurred significantly later in the transplant course
  in patients with GR compared with febrile HCT controls. These data support the use
  of CXCL9, BAFF, sC5b-9, and fever kinetics as GR markers. Two patients with GR underwent
  a second HCT that was complicated by high fevers. Both patients received interferon
  and complement blockers during their second HCT, and both preserved their graft.
  These laboratory and clinical findings support larger studies to evaluate the safety
  and efficacy of interferon, complement, and BAFF inhibitors for the prevention and
  treatment of GR after HCT.
