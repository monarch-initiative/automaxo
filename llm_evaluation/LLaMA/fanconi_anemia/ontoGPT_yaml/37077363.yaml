input_text: "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation in the pediatric with rare diseases-
  experience from China's first and the largest ovarian tissue cryobank. Background:
  There is limited information about the efficacy of ovarian tissue cryopreservation
  (OTC) in children. In the present study, we report eight patients with rare diseases
  who underwent OTC in China's first and largest ovarian tissue cryobank. Procedure:
  Data from girls with rare diseases who underwent OTC between September 2020 and
  November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. We also compared the number of cryopreserved
  cortex pieces, follicle number, and AMH in those with rare diseases and age-matched
  children with non-rare diseases who also underwent OTC in our cryobank. Results:
  The median age of the children was 5.88 +- 3.52 (range 2-13) years old. Unilateral
  oophorectomy was undertaken via laparoscopy in all of the children. The diseases
  in the 8 patients were: 4 mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS I two cases, IVA two cases),
  1 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), 1 Fanconi anemia (FA), 1 hyperimmunoglobulin E
  syndrome (HIES), 1 Niemann-Pick disease. The number of cryopreserved cortex pieces
  was 17.13 +- 6.36, and the follicle count per 2 mm biopsy was 447.38 +- 524.35.
  No significant difference in age, the count of cryopreserved cortex pieces, follicle
  number per 2 mm biopsy, and AMH level was seen between the 20 children with non-rare
  diseases and those with rare diseases. Conclusions: The reports help practitioners
  counsel girls with rare diseases about fertility preservation. The demand for OTC
  in pediatrics will likely grow as a standard of care."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
