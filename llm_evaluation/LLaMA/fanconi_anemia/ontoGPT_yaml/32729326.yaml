input_text: 'Induced Liver Regeneration Enhances CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Repair
  in Tyrosinemia Type 1. The efficiency of gene repair by homologous recombination
  in the liver is enhanced by CRISP/Cas9 incision near the mutation. In this study,
  we explored interventions designed to further enhance in vivo hepatocyte gene repair
  in a model of hereditary tyrosinemia. A two-AAV system was employed: one virus carried
  a Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) expression cassette and the other harbored
  a U6 promoter-driven sgRNA and a fragment of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)
  genomic DNA as the homologous recombination donor. In neonatal mice, a gene correction
  frequency of ~10.8% of hepatocytes was achieved. The efficiency in adult mice was
  significantly lower at ~1.6%. To determine whether hepatocyte replication could
  enhance the targeting frequency, cell division was induced with thyroid hormone
  T3. This more than doubled the gene correction efficiency to 3.5% (p < 0.005). To
  determine whether SpCas9 delivery was rate limiting, the gene repair AAV was administered
  to SpCas9 transgenic mice. However, this did not significantly enhance gene repair.
  Finally, we tested whether the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway was important
  in hepatocyte gene repair. Gene correction frequencies were significantly lower
  in neonatal mice lacking the FA complementation group A (Fanca) gene. Taken together,
  we conclude that pharmacological induction of hepatocyte replication along with
  manipulation of DNA repair pathways could be a useful strategy for enhancing in
  vivo gene correction.'
