input_text: 'Derivation of Breast Cancer Patient Derived Human Induced Pluripotent
  Stem Cell Line (YBLi006-A) with FANC-BRCA Gene Mutations: A Resource for Precision
  & Personalized Medicine. Fanconi anemia complementation group I (FANCI) is located
  on the chromosome 15q26.1 locus and becomes ubiquitinated following DNA damage.
  3.06% of patients with breast cancer have altered FANCI gene. We generated an iPSC
  line (YBLi006-A) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient carrying
  a mutation in FANCIgene (NM_001376911.1, NM_001376910.1, NM_001113378.2; c.80G >
  T, c.257C > T, c.2225G > C; p.Gly27Val, p.Ala86Val, p.Cys742Ser) using non-integrating
  Sendai virus technology. This unique breast cancer patient-derived-iPSC line will
  be resourceful to analyze the entire coding sequence and splicing sites ofFANCIin
  high-risk familial breast cancer.'
