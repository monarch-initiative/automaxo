input_text: Recent advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation for inherited bone
  marrow failure syndromes. Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) are a
  group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure with unique
  phenotypes and predisposition to cancer. Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi
  anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance
  dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis.
  Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive
  diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the
  identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic
  hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired
  hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects
  and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management
  is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with
  varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after
  HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related
  to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices
  along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.
