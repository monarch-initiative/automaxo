input_text: "Cancer in buccal mucosa in patients with Fanconi anemia: Report of six
  cases. INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive hereditary disease characterized
  by bone marrow failure, and the treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT). Patients diagnosed with FA are more predisposed to develop oral squamous
  cell carcinoma (SCC), and this risk increases in transplant patients. The clinical
  characteristics of the oral manifestations of SCC in this group of patients do not
  differ from the lesions present in patients without the disease; however, they can
  be diagnosed in young patients and less common locations, such as, for example,
  in the buccal mucosa. OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with
  FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed
  with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS:
  There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions
  in patients with FA. Thus, disclosing a series of cases with similar changes may
  be relevant to improving and refining the multidisciplinary team's clinical view
  of suspected SCC or oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), providing surveillance
  and timely management."
