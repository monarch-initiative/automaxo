input_text: 'Melphalan and Exportin 1 Inhibitors Exert Synergistic Antitumor Effects
  in Preclinical Models of Human Multiple Myeloma. High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan
  followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma.
  Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved
  by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor,
  and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and
  U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and
  U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from
  newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized
  by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226
  or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan
  combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than
  single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from
  increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased
  DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by
  selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple
  myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor
  when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair.
  Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may
  have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant
  and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently
  being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant
  (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically
  sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated
  DNA repair.'
