input_text: A Surge of DNA Damage Links Transcriptional Reprogramming and Hematopoietic
  Deficit in Fanconi Anemia. Impaired DNA crosslink repair leads to Fanconi anemia
  (FA), characterized by a unique manifestation of bone marrow failure and pancytopenia
  among diseases caused by DNA damage response defects. As a germline disorder, why
  the hematopoietic hierarchy is specifically affected is not fully understood. We
  find that reprogramming transcription during hematopoietic differentiation results
  in an overload of genotoxic stress, which causes aborted differentiation and depletion
  of FA mutant progenitor cells. DNA damage onset most likely arises from formaldehyde,
  an obligate by-product of oxidative protein demethylation during transcription regulation.
  Our results demonstrate that rapid and extensive transcription reprogramming associated
  with hematopoietic differentiation poses a major threat to genome stability and
  cell viability in the absence of the FA pathway. The connection between differentiation
  and DNA damage accumulation reveals a novel mechanism of genome scarring and is
  critical to exploring therapies to counteract the aplastic anemia for the treatment
  of FA patients.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
