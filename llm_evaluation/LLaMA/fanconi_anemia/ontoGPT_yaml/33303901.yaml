input_text: 'Survival and toxicity outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  for pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia: a unified multicentric national study
  from the Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children. Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative option for hematological
  manifestations in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). We report the outcome of 34
  patients with FA inside a collaborative multicenter national study based on recommendations
  of Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON) between
  2009 and 2016. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was carried out in all patients,
  with low dose total body irradiation in unrelated transplants. Disease status before
  HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF) in 30 patients and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
  in four. Donors were matched siblings donors (MSD) in 18, matched unrelated donors
  (MUD) in 15, and one haploidentical donor. All except one patient engrafted. Cumulative
  incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11%
  for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%)
  died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one
  (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma. Overall survival (OS) was 73% at 5 years post-transplant,
  with no differences between MSD and MUD transplants. OS for patients with BMF was
  80% while for MDS was 25%. Our data suggest HSCT can cure hematologic manifestations
  of most FA patients with BMF.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
