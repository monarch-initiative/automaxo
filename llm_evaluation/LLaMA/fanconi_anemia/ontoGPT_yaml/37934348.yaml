input_text: Gastric cancer with Fanconi anemia in adolescent and young adult patient
  diagnosed by comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing. Recently,
  the results of gastric cancer treatment have improved; however, its characteristics
  in adolescents and young adults are not well known. We report the case of a patient
  with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis.
  A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
  revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds
  with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed
  poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography
  revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal
  cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1
  stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated
  nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because
  of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen
  was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line
  treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased
  platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated.
  Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to
  determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation
  group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component
  of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after
  treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and
  young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.
