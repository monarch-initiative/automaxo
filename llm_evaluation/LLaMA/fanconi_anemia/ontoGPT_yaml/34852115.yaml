input_text: 'Nursing diagnosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to Fanconi
  anemia. OBJECTIVES: to identify nursing diagnoses in patients who underwent hematopoietic
  stem-cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, according to the NANDA-I taxonomy.
  METHODS: exploratory study using a retrospective analysis of 85 records from patients
  who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, developed
  in a specialize transplant center in the South of Brazil. The results were analyzed
  using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 73 different diagnoses were found in 9 out
  of the 13 domains from the NANDA-I taxonomy. From these, 22 were in 50% or more
  of the patients investigated, and most of them are related to the domain Safety/Protection.
  CONCLUSIONS: it was possible to identify the nursing diagnosis in the patients who
  underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, contributing
  to design a plan for the care of these patients. The same was true for those with
  other syndromes of chromosomal instability that need to undergo this transplant.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Fanconi anemia

  medical_actions: hematopoietic stem-cell transplant

  symptoms: None explicitly mentioned

  chemicals: None explicitly mentioned

  action_annotation_relationships: hematopoietic stem-cell transplant TREATS Fanconi anemia; nursing diagnosis PREVENTS complications IN Fanconi anemia 

  Note that the text does not provide a comprehensive list of symptoms or chemicals, and the relationships between medical actions and symptoms are not explicitly stated. The extracted relationships are inferred based on the context. 

  Also, note that I did not include "nursing diagnosis" as a medical action, as it seems to be a process or a procedure rather than a clinically prescribed intervention. If you would like me to include it, I can revise the extraction accordingly.

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
