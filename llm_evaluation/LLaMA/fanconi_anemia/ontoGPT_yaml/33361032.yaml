  associated with disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia: Implication in
  targeted therapy of advanced phase CML. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly
  improved the clinical outcome of BCR-ABL+ Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
  (CP-CML). Nonetheless, approximately one-third of the CP-CML patient's progress
  to advanced phases of CML (accelerated and blast phase). Impaired DNA repair including
  mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of
  many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid
  cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with
  CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along
  with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2
  is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first
  report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel
  marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies
  are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can
  provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination
  TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved
  anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome
  CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
