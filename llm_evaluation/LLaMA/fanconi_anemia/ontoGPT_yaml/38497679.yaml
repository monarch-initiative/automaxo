input_text: "HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with inherited
  bone marrow failure syndromes: A retrospective analysis on behalf of EBMT severe
  aplastic Anemia and pediatric diseases working parties. Haploidentical stem cell
  transplantation (haplo-SCT) represents the main alternative for children with inherited
  bone marrow failure syndrome (I-BMF) lacking a matched donor. This retrospective
  study, conducted on behalf of the EBMT SAAWP and PDWP, aims to report the current
  outcomes of haplo-SCT in I-BMFs, comparing the different in vivo and ex vivo T-cell
  depletion approaches. One hundred and sixty-two I-BMF patients who underwent haplo-SCT
  (median age 7.4 years) have been registered. Fanconi Anemia was the most represented
  diagnosis (70.1%). Based on different T-cell depletion (TCD) approaches, four categories
  were identified: (1) TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ -depletion (43.8%); (2) T-repleted with
  post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy, 34.0%); (3) In-vivo T-depletion with ATG/alemtuzumab
  (14.8%); (4) CD34+ positive selection (7.4%). The cumulative incidences (CI) of
  neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of
  primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI
  of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic
  GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS)
  and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively.
  The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence
  of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001),
  while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis
  and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and
  feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers
  higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe
  a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms."
