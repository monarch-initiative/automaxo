input_text: 'Fanconi anemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant as risk factors
  for oral squamous cell carcinoma: A case report with a 12-year follow-up. Fanconi
  anemia is a rare disorder resulting from defects in genes responsible for DNA damage
  responses. It is characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia, and a predisposition
  to cancer. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative
  treatment available for bone marrow failure; however, HSCT increases oral squamous
  cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk. Here we report the case of a patient diagnosed with
  Fanconi anemia in childhood who was treated with HSCT and later diagnosed with multiple
  OSCCs during a 12-year follow-up. Despite multiple surgical interventions and radiotherapy
  regimens, the patient`s health deteriorated. Management of individuals with Fanconi
  anemia is challenging and must be provided by a multidisciplinary healthcare team
  to ensure better staging, treatment planning, and coordination.'
