input_text: Human Mastadenovirus A Infection in a Child During the Course of Hematopoietic
  Stem Cell Transplant. Following primary infection, human mastadeno- viruses can
  persist in various tissues. We report a case of a pediatric patient with Fanconi
  anemia who had a complicated posttransplant course after allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant that was associated with human mastadenovirus infection. Human
  mastadenovirus reactivation was detected with metagenomic analysis during a 3-month
  follow- up period; the predominant rate of occurrence of human mastadenoviruses
  was 1.1% on day 0, 84% on day +15, 90% on day +30, and 42% on day +82. Virus shedding
  continued up to 3 months after transplant. At 36 months after hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant, the patient was in good clinical condition with full donor chimerism.
  Long-term follow-up studies for human mastadenoviruses are needed to determine latency
  period.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
