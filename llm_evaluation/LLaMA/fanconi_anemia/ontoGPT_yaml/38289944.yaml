input_text: A murine model to evaluate immunotherapy effectiveness for human Fanconi
  anemia-mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Fanconi anemia (FA)-mutated acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML) is a secondary AML with very poor prognosis and limited therapeutic
  options due to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. PD-1 immune checkpoint
  inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising
  treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows
  the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic
  treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected
  into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression
  in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were
  injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor)
  or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab
  treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged
  overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen
  weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1
  engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized
  murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies
  and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.
