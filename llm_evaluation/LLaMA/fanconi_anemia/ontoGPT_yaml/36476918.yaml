input_text: "[Clinical Analysis of Salvage Treatment of Glucocorticoid Resistant Graft-Versus-Host
  Disease with Vedolizumab in Children]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and
  safety of VDZ (Vedolizumab) in the salvage treatment of glucocorticoid resistance
  to gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GR-GI GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children. METHODS: The clinical data of
  5 patients with refractory GI GVHD who received allo-HSCT in Wuhan Children's Hospital
  from December 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed with VDZ salvage
  therapy. RESULTS: Among the 5 children with refractory GI GVHD, there were 1 male
  and 4 female, including 2 cases of extremely severe aplastic anemia, 1 case of acute
  myeloid leukemia (M2, high-risk), 1 case of fanconi anemia and 1 case of myelodysplastic
  syndrome. The median age of transplant recipients was 54.4 (12-164) months. The
  median treatment time from transplantation to VDZ was 1.4 (0.6-6.8) months. On average,
  3.5 (2-5) doses of VDZ were received. After receiving treatment, 2 patients achieved
  a complete response (CR), 2 patients achieved a very good partial response (VGPR),
  1 patient was non-responsive (NR) after a short-term partial response (PR). Compared
  with that before VDZ treatment, the amount of diarrhea, stool color, blood and traits
  of the children after medication were effectively improved. The median follow-up
  time was 9.3 (7.23-12.83) months. No disseminated or severe bacterial/fungal infections
  occurred during VDZ treatment and follow-up, and 2 children died of leukemia recurrence
  and pulmonary bronchiolitis obliterans. CONCLUSION: VDZ salvage treatment of refractory
  GI GVHD in children has obvious short-term efficacy and good safety."
