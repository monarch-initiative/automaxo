38056933	Perioperative considerations for adult patients with Dravet syndrome in regional centres.	Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare and intractable severe form of epilepsy presenting in infancy with frequent prolonged myoclonic seizures and neurodevelopmental impairment, associated with a SCN1A gene mutation. Seizures are often triggered by temperature fluctuations and hyperthermia. This report presents a woman in her late adolescence with DS complicated with intractable catamenial epilepsy, a sex-specific form of epilepsy with seizure activity prominent during phases of the menstrual cycle. The patient underwent general anaesthesia for a hysteroscopy, cervical dilatation and endometrial curettage with Mirena insertion to improve seizure control. Her perioperative care was optimised for seizure prevention with continuation of antiepileptic medications, strict temperature monitoring and control, optimised anaesthetic agents encompassing induction with propofol and fentanyl with maintenance sevoflurane, followed by attentive postoperative care and monitoring. This case demonstrates that general anaesthesia can safely be delivered to adult patients with DS in rural and regional areas with thorough perioperative planning.
39191071	Neurosurgical gene therapy for central nervous system diseases.	Viral vector mediated gene therapies for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions that require neurosurgical administration continue to expand. We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.
32350749	A Phase II Randomized Trial to Explore the Potential for Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions with Stiripentol or Valproate when Combined with Cannabidiol in Patients with Epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: In recent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, highly purified cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It is anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered concomitantly with cannabidiol. OBJECTIVES: This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy, and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol. METHODS: This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex  in the USA; Epidyolex  in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02607891.
38643663	Changes in pediatric referrals after the 2009 ketogenic diet consensus recommendations.	BACKGROUND: In 2009, the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group published recommendations for children receiving ketogenic diet (KD) therapy for epilepsy. The document included a table listing epilepsy syndromes and conditions in which the KD has been particularly beneficial, hoping that physicians would refer children for the KD sooner. PURPOSE: To measure the impact of these 2009 recommendations on referral practice, we compared children initiated on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) 10 years before and after the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, children referred to the KD who met indications increased from the pre- to post-recommendation group, 44 % (112/256) to 69 % (175/255) (p < 0.001), with JHH neurologists specifically referring more frequently (10/112, 9 % to 58/175, 33 %) (p < 0.01). Referrals increased for Glut-1 deficiency (0 % to 2.4 %, p = 0.015), Dravet syndrome (0 % to 6.7 %, p < 0.01), Rett syndrome (0.4 % to 3 %, p = 0.018), and formula-fed only status (16 % to 31 %, p < 0.01). The chances of > 50 % seizure reduction for all children referred improved slightly between decades (56 % to 61 %, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Following the 2009 recommendations, our study shows there was an increase in referrals for children with indications at our center. Referrals from neurologists at our own institution increased the most. Ketogenic diet efficacy improved slightly over time but did not reach significance.

32452568	Does cannabidiol have antiseizure activity independent of its interactions with clobazam? An appraisal of the evidence from randomized controlled trials.	Four pivotal randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that adjunctive therapy with cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Between 47% and 68% of patients allocated to CBD treatment in these trials were receiving clobazam (CLB), which shows complex interactions with CBD resulting, in particular, in a 3.4- to 5-fold increase in plasma concentration of the active metabolite norclobazam. This raises concern as to the role played by these interactions in determining the reduction in seizure frequency in CBD-treated patients, and the question of whether CBD per se has clinically evident antiseizure effects. We appraised available evidence on the clinical consequences of the CBD-CLB interaction, focusing on subgroup analyses of seizure outcomes in patients on and off CLB comedication in the pivotal CBD trials, as provided by the European Medicines Agency Public Assessment Report. Evaluation of the results of individual trials clearly showed that improvement in seizure control over placebo was greater when CBD was added on to CLB than when it was added on to other medications. However, seizure control was also improved in patients off CLB, and despite the small sample size the difference vs placebo was statistically significant for the 10 mg/kg/d dose in one of the two LGS trials. Stronger evidence for an antiseizure effect of CBD independent of an interaction with CLB emerges from meta-analyses of seizure outcomes in the pooled population of LGS and DS patients not receiving CLB comedication. Although these results need to be interpreted taking into account methodological limitations, they provide the best clinical evidence to date that CBD exerts therapeutic effects in patients with epilepsy that are independent of its interaction with CLB. Greater antiseizure effects, and a greater burden of adverse effects, are observed when CBD is combined with CLB.
31529424	Accuracy of Flash Glucose Monitoring in a Patient with Dravet Syndrome on a Ketogenic Diet.	We herein report the case of a 3-year-old girl with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) on a ketogenic diet (KD) whose glucose concentrations were controlled by using a flash glucose monitoring system. Two-hundred ninety-three events of moderate hypoglycemia with a minimum of 45 mg/dL, not related to day or night, were recorded during the observational period. Hypoglycemia rate declined from 24.5% of all measurements to 11.8% over time; one hypoglycemia-associated seizure and one seizure due to ketone concentrations below the therapeutic range were observed. In summary, this case report broadens our understanding of hypoglycemia risk in patients with DS on a KD. Especially in childhood, the painless and easy detection of low glucose concentrations might lead to improved cognitive performance, and the reduction of hypoglycemia-induced seizures.
31864146	A single-center, retrospective analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations in children with Dravet syndrome.	PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused most often by loss-of-function SCN1A variants. Following recognition of its genetic basis and unique clinical features, Dravet syndrome has become one of the most well-studied genetic epilepsies. We sought to evaluate the genetic diversity and correlative seizure phenotype, comorbidities, and response to antiepileptic therapies of patients with clinically-diagnosed Dravet syndrome seen in a tertiary care center. The goal of this study was to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and to ascertain if specific antiepileptic therapies may be more effective on the basis of genetic test result alone. METHOD: Retrospective chart review of demographics, comorbidities, seizure types, and responses to antiepileptic therapies of all patients (n = 137) with a clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome seen at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago from 2008 to 2016. RESULTS: Of the 96% of Dravet syndrome patients with pathogenic SCN1A variants subdivided by missense or truncating variant, there was no difference in clinical presentation. Response to antiepileptic therapies did not differ by genotype with regard to medication class. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of Dravet patients from within the US to report medication response with respect to genotype. Missense variants in SCN1A were most common in the voltage-sensor and pore domains. All patients were most likely to respond to the recommended medication triad compared to other antiepileptic therapies.
33908026	New therapeutic approach in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with cannabidiol.	INTRODUCTION: Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) are two serious epileptic syndromes with paediatric onset which are refractory to therapy and are associated with an important increase in mortality rates and comorbidities compared to the general population. These pathologies have a strong impact on the lives of patients and their families, because they undergo multiple pharmacological therapies (many of them without specific indication), with frequent changes due to poor efficacy and associated adverse effects. The specialists who care for these patients highlight unmet needs and the lack of specific, safe and effective treatments for better management of the syndrome. DEVELOPMENT: A group of four neurologists specializing in epilepsy has met to review the scientific literature and evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral solution cannabidiol in the treatment of these syndromes, both in randomized clinical trials (CT) and in some observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol is positioned as an innovative therapy that allows better control of epileptic seizures and comorbidities of DS and LGS, furthermore its efficacy and safety have been evaluated in more than 700 patients. In CTs, cannabidiol significantly reduced the percentage of convulsive seizures and drop seizures compared to placebo in patients with DS and LGS respectively, which could improve their quality of life and that of their family members. The most frequent adverse effects reported were somnolence and decreased appetite. Elevated liver aminotransferase levels were also reported, especially in patients given concomitant sodium valproate. This therapy may allow better control of the epileptic seizures associated with these syndromes.
35134735	Status epilepticus following vaccination in children aged <=24 months: A five-year retrospective observational study.	BACKGROUND: Status epilepticus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While vaccine-proximate status epilepticus (VP-SE) has rarely been associated with cases of Dravet syndrome, it is not known whether VP-SE differs clinically from non-vaccine proximate status epilepticus (NVP-SE). METHODS: Medical records of children aged <=24 months, presenting to one of five Australian tertiary pediatric hospitals with their first episode of status epilepticus from 2013 to 2017 were identified using ICD-coded discharge diagnoses. Vaccination history was obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register. Hospitalization details, subsequent epilepsy diagnosis, and vaccination uptake were compared between VP-SE and NVP-SE cases. RESULTS: Of 245 first status epilepticus hospitalization with immunization records, 35 (14%) were VP-SE and 21 (60%) followed measles-containing vaccines. Vaccine-proximate status epilepticus cases had a median age of 12.5 months [IQR 7.1-14.73], 23 (66%) were in males, 15 (43%) were febrile status epilepticus and 17 (49%) had an infection confirmed. There were no significant differences in hospitalization duration (P = 0.50) or intensive care unit admission (P = 0.42) between children with VP-SE compared to children with NVP-SE. Children with no history of seizures at their first VP-SE had longer hospitalizations, were more likely to require intensive care unit admission, but were less likely to have a subsequent diagnosis of epilepsy than children with previous seizures at their first VP-SE. CONCLUSION: First VP-SE was predominantly associated with a measles-containing vaccine at 12-months of age. Seizure severity was no different between first VP-SE and first NVP-SE. In children with VP-SE, subsequent seizure admissions and epilepsy diagnosis were associated with having seizure prior to their first SE.
34687005	Effect of Cannabidiol on Interictal Epileptiform Activity and Sleep Architecture in Children with Intractable Epilepsy: A Prospective Open-Label Study.	BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol has been shown to be effective in seizure reduction in patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.
31549357	Recent Advances in the Drug Treatment of Dravet Syndrome.	Dravet syndrome is a rare but severe epilepsy syndrome that begins in the first year of life with recurrent seizures triggered by fever that are typically prolonged and hemiclonic. The epilepsy is highly drug resistant. Although development is normal at onset, over time, most patients develop moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, behavior disorders, and a characteristic crouch gait. There is a significant mortality, predominantly owing to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Complete seizure control is rarely attainable. Initial therapy includes valproic acid and clobazam, but response is typically inadequate. The results of new drugs for Dravet syndrome, including stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine, are very promising. Stiripentol was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency in 71% of cases, when added to valproic acid and clobazam, and also markedly reduced status epilepticus. Pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol resulted in a median change in monthly motor seizures from baseline of - 36.5%. Fenfluramine was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in seizures of 70%, with one quarter of cases achieving near seizure freedom over the duration of the trial. These agents are generally well tolerated, with few patients discontinuing for adverse effects. There is limited evidence to date regarding improvement in cognition with these newer agents; however, a meaningful change is challenging to assess over short trial periods and requires longer follow-up studies. While current treatments focus predominantly on seizure control, newer therapies including genetic treatments and antisense oligonucleotides can target the SCN1A channelopathy, and thus, may also significantly impact the important co-morbidities associated with this syndrome.
34378168	Dravet Syndrome: Novel Approaches for the Most Common Genetic Epilepsy.	Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that is mainly associated with variants in SCN1A. While drug-resistant epilepsy is the most notable feature of this syndrome, numerous symptoms are present that have significant impact on patients' quality of life. In spite of novel, third-generation anti-seizure treatment options becoming available over the last several years, seizure freedom is often not attained and non-seizure symptoms remain. Precision medicine now offers realistic hope for seizure freedom in DS patients, with several approaches demonstrating preclinical success. Therapeutic approaches such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered gene modulation have expanded the potential treatment options for DS, with some of these approaches now transitioning to clinical trials. Several of these treatments may risk the exacerbation of gain-of-function variants and may not be reversible, therefore emphasizing the need for functional testing of new pathogenic variants. The current absence of treatments that address the overall disease, in addition to seizures, exposes the urgent need for reliable, valid measures of the entire complement of symptoms as outcome measures to truly know the impact of treatments on DS. Additionally, with so many treatment options on the horizon, there will be a need to understand how to select appropriate patients for each treatment, whether treatments are complementary or adverse to each other, and long-term risks of the treatment. Nevertheless, precision therapeutics hold tremendous potential to provide long-lasting seizure freedom and even complete cures for this devastating disease.
32452532	Cannabidiol efficacy and clobazam status: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential impact of concomitant clobazam (CLB) use on the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion of patients who achieved >=50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: Four trials were included and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the >=50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). SIGNIFICANCE: CBD was associated with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.
31790543	Fenfluramine for Treatment-Resistant Seizures in Patients With Dravet Syndrome Receiving Stiripentol-Inclusive Regimens: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Fenfluramine treatment may reduce monthly convulsive seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome who have poor seizure control with their current stiripentol-containing antiepileptic drug regimens. Objective: To determine whether fenfluramine reduced monthly convulsive seizure frequency relative to placebo in patients with Dravet syndrome who were taking stiripentol-inclusive regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in multiple centers. Eligible patients were children aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome who were receiving stable, stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens. Interventions: Patients with 6 or more convulsive seizures during the 6-week baseline period were randomly assigned to receive fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (maximum, 17 mg/d), or a placebo. After titration (3 weeks), patients' assigned dosages were maintained for 12 additional weeks. Caregivers recorded seizures via a daily electronic diary. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was the change in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency between fenfluramine and placebo during the combined titration and maintenance periods relative to baseline. Results: A total of 115 eligible patients were identified; of these, 87 patients (mean [SD], age 9.1 [4.8] years; 50 male patients [57%]; mean baseline frequency of seizures, approximately 25 convulsive seizures per month) were enrolled and randomized to fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Patients treated with fenfluramine achieved a 54.0% (95% CI, 35.6%-67.2%; P < .001) greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency than those receiving the placebo. With fenfluramine, 54% of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful (>=50%) reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency vs 5% with placebo (P < .001). The median (range) longest seizure-free interval was 22 (3.0-105.0) days with fenfluramine and 13 (1.0-40.0) days with placebo (P = .004). The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (19 patients taking fenfluramine [44%] vs 5 taking placebo [11%]), fatigue (11 [26%] vs 2 [5%]), diarrhea (10 [23%] vs 3 [7%]), and pyrexia (11 [26%] vs 4 [9%]). Cardiac monitoring demonstrated no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Conclusions and Relevance: Fenfluramine demonstrated significant improvements in monthly convulsive seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome whose conditions were insufficiently controlled with stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens. Fenfluramine was generally well tolerated. Fenfluramine may represent a new treatment option for Dravet syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02926898.
34664698	Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Intractable Epilepsy.	AIM: To investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy in different types of epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients, who were implanted with VNS between the years 2005 and 2020, were retrospectively included in the study. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, epilepsy types, VNS implantation year, replacement year, pre and post-VNS seizure frequency, number of responders, number of antiseizure medication and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 41 patients were included in the study. The number of patients with focal epilepsy was 21 (51.2%). 10 patients (24.4%) had generalized epilepsy and 10 patients (24.4%) had ?combined generalized and focal epilepsy? (Lennox-Gastaut, Dravet syndrome). The Pre-VNS median seizure frequency was 1.5/day in the focal group, 0.6/day in the generalized group and 6/day in the combined group. Seizure frequencies dropped to 0.3/day in the focal group, 0.2/day in the generalized group and 3.0/day in the combined group at the 12th month after VNS (p < 0.001, p=0.004, p < 0.001). The response rate was found to be 68.3% at the 12th month after VNS. The number of antiseizure medications was decreased from 3.6/day to 3.1/day at the 12th months after VNS (p < 0.001). Two patients? (4.9%) VNS therapy was discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that VNS therapy is safe and effective in focal, generalized and combined epilepsy types. Despite having a low seizure freedom rate, VNS is a good alternative treatment option for patients who for any reason are not candidates for resective surgery.
33940389	A phase 1b/2a study of soticlestat as adjunctive therapy in participants with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of soticlestat, a first-in-class cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitor, in adults with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). METHODS: The study comprised a 30-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (Part A), followed by a 55-day open-label phase (Part B) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03166215) . In Part A, patients with DEE and at least one bilateral motor seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized 4:1 to receive soticlestat or placebo, in addition to their usual antiseizure medication. In Part B, all patients received open-label soticlestat. Soticlestat doses were titrated according to tolerability to a maximum of 300 mg twice daily (BID). Safety evaluations included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Plasma soticlestat concentrations were measured at various times for determination of multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC). Efficacy was assessed by evaluation of changes in seizure frequency from baseline. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age, 28.5 years) were enrolled and randomized, and 14 (78 %) completed the study. In Part A, TEAEs occurred in 71.4 % of soticlestat-treated patients and 100 % of placebo-treated patients. In Part B, the overall incidence of TEAEs was 68.8 %. In Part A, TEAEs that occurred in more than one patient in the soticlestat group were dysarthria (n = 3, 21.4 %), lethargy (n = 2, 14.3 %), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 2, 14.3 %), fatigue (n = 2, 14.3 %), and headache (n = 2, 14.3 %). Four patients discontinued treatment because of TEAEs, of whom two reported drug-related seizure clusters as serious TEAEs. There were no deaths. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose-dependent increases in systemic exposure and peak plasma soticlestat concentrations. At the end of Part B, the overall mean percent change from baseline in plasma 24HC was -80.97 %. Changes from baseline in median seizure frequency were +16.71 % and +22.16 % in the soticlestat and placebo groups, respectively, in Part A, and -36.38 % in all participants in Part B. CONCLUSION: Soticlestat was well tolerated at doses of up to 300 mg BID and was associated with a reduction in median seizure frequency over the study duration. Further studies are warranted to assess the possible efficacy of soticlestat as adjunctive therapy in patients with DEEs such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
35334258	The clinical, economic, and humanistic burden of Dravet syndrome - A systematic literature review.	Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with evolving disease course as individuals age. In recent years, the treatment landscape of DS has changed considerably, and a comprehensive systematic review of the contemporary literature is lacking. Here we synthesized published evidence on the occurrence of clinical impacts by age, the economic and humanistic (health-related quality-of-life [HRQoL]) burden, and health state utility. We provide an evidence-based, contemporary visualization of the clinical manifestations, highlighting that DS is not limited to seizures; non-seizure manifestations appear early in life and increase over time, contributing significantly to the economic and humanistic burden of disease. The primary drivers of HRQoL in DS include seizure severity, cognition, and motor and behavioral problems; in turn, these directly affect caregivers through the extent of assistance required and consequent impact on activities of daily living. Unsurprisingly, costs are driven by seizure-related events, hospitalizations, and in-home medical care visits. This systematic review highlights a paucity of longitudinal data; most studies meeting inclusion criteria were cross-sectional or had short follow-up. Nonetheless, available data illustrate the substantial impact on individuals, their families, and healthcare systems and establish the need for novel therapies to address the complex spectrum of DS manifestations.
32918835	Clinical implications of trials investigating drug-drug interactions between cannabidiol and enzyme inducers or inhibitors or common antiseizure drugs.	Highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in randomized, double-blind, add-on, controlled phase 3 trials. It is important to consider the possibility of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Here, we review six trials of CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex; 100 mg/mL oral solution) in healthy volunteers or patients with epilepsy, which investigated potential interactions between CBD and enzymes involved in drug metabolism of common antiseizure drugs (ASDs). CBD did not affect CYP3A4 activity. Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 led to small reductions in exposure to CBD and its major metabolites. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity did not affect CBD exposure and caused small increases in exposure to CBD metabolites. Inhibition of CYP2C19 activity led to a small increase in exposure to CBD and small decreases in exposure to CBD metabolites. One potentially clinically important DDI was identified: combination of CBD and clobazam (CLB) did not affect CBD or CLB exposure, but increased exposure to major metabolites of both compounds. Reduction of CLB dose may be considered if adverse reactions known to occur with CLB are experienced when it is coadministered with CBD. There was a small increase of exposure to stiripentol (STP) when coadministered with CBD. STP had no effect on CBD exposure but led to minor decreases in exposure to CBD metabolites. Combination of CBD and valproate (VPA) did not cause clinically important changes in the pharmacokinetics of either drug, or 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid. Concomitant VPA caused small increases in exposure to CBD metabolites. Dose adjustments are not likely to be necessary when CBD is combined with STP or VPA. The safety results from these trials were consistent with the known safety profile of CBD. These trials indicate an overall low potential for DDIs between CBD and other ASDs, except for CLB.
37060636	The ketogenic diet for Dravet syndrome: A multicenter retrospective study.	OBJECTIVE: The ketogenic diet (KD) is one of the main treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. However, there have been few multicenter reports on the use of the KD for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS). The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of this approach based on a large number of multicenter cases. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study from 14 centers in China. All patients were treated with the KD. We compared the effects of KD intervention time, age, and other factors. RESULTS: From March 2014 to March 2020, we treated 114 patients with DS with the KD. The male-to-female ratio was 67:47. The KD median initiation age was 3 y and 4 mo, and the median number of antiseizure medications (ASMs) was 2.4. KD therapy was the first choice for three patients. Exactly 10.5% of the patients started KD therapy after failure of the first ASM therapy, with 35.1% after failure of the second, 44.7% after the third, and 7% after the fourth or more. After KD therapy for 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo, the seizure-free rates were 14%, 32.5%, 30.7%, and 19.3%, respectively; KD efficacy (>=50% reduction in seizure frequency) were 57.9%, 76.3%, 59.6%, and 43%, respectively; the retention rates were 97.4%, 93%, 71.9%, and 46.5%, respectively; and the rates of adverse events were 25.2%, 19.9%, 11%, and 5.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world, multicenter data analysis showed that the KD is effective for patients with DS and has a low incidence of side effects.
31879226	Abnormal brain gamma oscillations in response to auditory stimulation in Dravet syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of children with Dravet syndrome to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity in response to auditory steady-state stimulation. METHODS: Fifty-one subjects were included: 13 with Dravet syndrome with SCN1A gene alterations, 26 with non-Dravet epilepsies and 12 healthy controls. Responses to auditory steady-state stimulation elicited with a chirp-modulated tone between 1 and 120 Hz were collected in subjects and compared across groups. RESULTS: Subjects with Dravet syndrome showed weak or no responses in the 1-120 Hz frequency range. Healthy controls showed oscillatory responses following the frequency of the modulation that were maximal in the low (30-70 Hz) and high (80-120) gamma-ranges both, in the power and inter-trial coherence estimates. Non-Dravet epileptic children showed differences in the auditory responses when compared with the healthy controls but were able to generate oscillatory evoked activities following the frequency-varying stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity of children with Dravet in response to a chirp-modulated auditory stimulus is highly impaired, is not due to epilepsy and is consistent with the Nav1.1 channel dysfunction affecting interneuron activity seen in Dravet mouse models. SIGNIFICANCE: The reported deficits in the brain oscillatory activity evoked by chirp modulated tones in children with Dravet is compatible with Dravet syndrome disease mechanisms and constitutes a potential biomarker for future disease-modifying interventions.
37212649	Population pharmacokinetics, enzyme occupancy, and 24S-hydroxycholesterol modeling of soticlestat, a novel cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitor, in healthy adults.	Soticlestat is a first-in-class, selective inhibitor of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), which catabolizes cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) in the brain, in phase III development for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome treatment. This study aimed to develop a model of soticlestat pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) using 24HC plasma concentrations and CH24H enzyme occupancy (EO) time profiles. Subsequently, model-based simulations were conducted to identify dosing strategies for phase II trials in children and adults with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Four phase I trials of healthy adults involving oral administration of soticlestat 15-1350 mg were used to develop the mixed-effect population PK/EO/PD model. The population PK analysis utilized 1727 observations (104 individuals), PK/EO analysis utilized 20 observations (11 individuals), and PK/PD analysis utilized 2270 observations (99 individuals). Optimal dosing strategies were identified from model-based PK, EO, and PD simulations. The PK/EO/PD model described the observed data well and comprised a two-compartment model with dose as a covariate on peripheral volume, linear elimination, and intercompartmental clearance. Transit and effect-site compartments were included to accommodate different dosage forms and the delay between plasma drug concentrations and EO. Model-based simulations indicated that soticlestat 100-300 mg twice daily may be an optimal adult dosing regimen with weight-adjusted pediatric dosing strategies identified for evaluation in phase II trials. The population PK/EO/PD model provided understanding of the soticlestat PK/PD relationship with partial delineation of sources of variability, and identified dosing strategies for phase II trials of children and adults with DEEs.
32380482	Alteration in brain connectivity in patients with Dravet syndrome after vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): exploration of its effectiveness using graph theory analysis with electroencephalography.	OBJECTIVE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients who have pharmaco-resistant Dravet syndrome (DS). Plentiful efforts have been made for delivering VNS to DS patients, but its effectiveness still requires further verification. We investigated the effectiveness of the VNS treatment of DS patients using brain connectivity analysis with electroencephalography (EEG). APPROACH: Twenty pharmaco-resistant DS patients were selected to undergo VNS implantation and classified into responder and non-responder groups after 24 months post-VNS. The effect of VNS between 6 months pre- and 6, 12, and 24 months post-VNS in all patients, responders, and non-responders on four different frequency categories of four brain parameters were compared using resting-state EEG. MAIN RESULTS: In alpha and beta bands, all patients showed positive results for characteristic path length (CPL), global efficiency (GE), and transitivity after VNS treatment, and changes in betweenness centrality (BC) were not significant. The difference in transitivity between responders and non-responders is more pronounced than those in CPL and GE are, in both the alpha (p < 0.015) and beta (p < 0.001) bands. There was an obvious change in BC, especially in the alpha band, as the hubs tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders; however, there was no change for the non-responders. SIGNIFICANCE: We investigated the alteration in brain connectivity of DS patients in alpha and beta bands during a long-term follow-up and found the responders have a decreased transitivity after the VNS treatment. Moreover, the hubs with high values in the alpha band tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders after VNS treatment.
32330677	Therapeutic hypothermia for pediatric refractory status epilepticus May Ameliorate post-status epilepticus epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: To compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pediatric patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) who received therapeutic hypothermia (TH) plus anticonvulsants or anticonvulsants alone. METHODS: Two-medical referral centers, retrospective cohort study. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Taoyuan Chang Gung Children's hospital and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We reviewed the medical records of 23 patients with RSE/SRSE who were admitted to PICU from January 2014 to December 2017. Of these, 11 patients received TH (TH group) and 12 patients did not (control group). RESULTS: The selective endpoints were RSE/SRSE duration, length of PICU stay, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. We applied TH using the Artic Sun  temperature management system (target temperature, 34-35  C; duration, 48-72 h). Of the 11 patients who received TH, 7 had febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRSE), one had Dravet syndrome, and three had traumatic brain injury. The TH group had significantly shortern seizure durations than did the control group (hrs; median (IQR) 24(40) vs. 96(90), p < 0.05). Two patients in the TH group died of pulmonary embolism and extreme brain edema. The length of PICU stay was similar between the groups (days; median (IQR) 30(42) v.s 30.5(30.25)). The TH group had significantly better long-term outcomes than did the control group (GOS score, median (IQR) 4(2) v.s 3 (0.75), p = 0.01*). The TH group had a significantly lower incidence of later chronic refractory epilepsy than did the control group (TH v.s non-TH, 5/11 (45%) v.s. 12/12(100%), p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TH effectively reduced the seizure burden in patients with RSE/SRSE. Our findings support that for patients with RSE/SRSE, TH shortens the seizure duration, ultimately reducing the occurrence of post-status epilepticus epilepsy and improving patients' long-term survival.
38318727	Norwegian population-based study of effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.	OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) compared with epilepsy patients without intellectual disability (ID). METHODS: Long-term outcomes from a Norwegian VNS quality registry are reported in 105 patients with DEEs (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [LGS] n = 62; Dravet n = 16; Rett n = 9; other syndromes n = 18) were compared with 212 epilepsy patients without ID, with median follow-up of 88 and 72 months, respectively. Total seizure reduction was evaluated at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months. Effect on different seizure types was evaluated at baseline and last observation carried forward (LOCF). RESULTS: Median monthly seizure frequency at LOCF was reduced by 42.2% (p < 0.001) in patients with DEE and by 55.8% (p < 0.001) in patients without ID. In DEE patients, >=50% seizure reduction at 6 and 24 months were 17.1% and 37.1%, respectively, and 33.5% and 48.6% for patients without ID. Seizure reduction >=75% at 60 months occurred in 14.3% of DEE patients and 23.1% of patients without ID. Highest median reduction was for atonic seizures, most notably 64.6% for LGS patients. A better effect was seen at 2 years among DEE patients with unchanged medication compared with those with changed medication (54.5% vs. 35.6% responders, p = 0.078). More DEE patients were reported to have greater improvement in ictal or postictal severity (43.8% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.006) and alertness (62.9% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001) than patients without ID. For both groups, use of the magnet reduced seizure severity. Hoarseness was the most common adverse effect in both groups. In addition, DEE patients were frequently reported to have sleep disturbance, general discomfort, or abdominal problems. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that VNS is very effective for atonic seizures. Patients without ID had best overall seizure reduction, however, patients with DEE had higher retention rates probably due to other positive effects. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: DEE refers to a group of patients with severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. Many of these patients have restricted lifestyles with frequent seizures. VNS is a treatment option for patients who do not respond well to medicines, either because of insufficient effect or serious adverse effects. Our study shows that VNS is well tolerated in this patient group and leads to a reduction in all seizure types, most notably for seizures leading to fall. Many patients experience other positive effects like shorter and milder seizures, as well as improvement in alertness.
34378197	Efficacy, tolerability, and retention of fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome: Compassionate use program in Germany.	OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare but severe drug-resistant epilepsy. Before the approval of fenfluramine (FFA) for the treatment of seizures in DS, patients in Germany could receive treatment under a compassionate use program (CUP). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational study to describe the efficacy, tolerability, and retention of FFA within the CUP. Patients received add-on therapy with oral FFA gradually titrated to a target dose between .13 and .7 mg/kg/day. RESULTS: Overall, 78 patients with DS (median age = 8.0 years, range = 2.1-46.0; 53% female, median concomitant antiseizure medications [ASMs] = 3) were treated with FFA for a median duration of 255.5 days (range = 31-572). Responder rates (a >=50% reduction; n = 78) and seizure-freedom rates at 3 months were 68% and 14% for total seizures, respectively, and 67% and 23% for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Responder rates were consistent at 6 and 12 months (n = 66 and n = 43, respectively). Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 10.0 (range = .5-30) to 3.0 (range = 0-30) in the 3-month period before and after FFA treatment (p < .001). Significantly fewer patients reported at least one episode of status epilepticus (28% vs. 14% patients before and after FFA initiation, p = .005). During FFA treatment, 35 (45%) patients were able to discontinue a concomitant ASM. At the last follow-up date, 66 (85%) patients remained on treatment with FFA. The most common adverse events were somnolence (36%), decreased appetite (22%), and ataxia (8%). Forty-eight (62%) patients were reported as having a meaningful global clinical improvement. SIGNIFICANCE: In a large cohort of patients, FFA demonstrated efficacy across a range of outcomes including clinically significant reductions in convulsive seizures, and was well tolerated, providing valuable information for real-world practice.
35383912	COVID-19 vaccine in patients with Dravet syndrome: Observations and real-world experiences.	OBJECTIVE: Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a primary tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, vaccination is a common seizure trigger in individuals with Dravet syndrome (DS). Information surrounding COVID-19 vaccine side effects in patients with DS would aid caregivers and providers in decisions for and management of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A survey was emailed to the Dravet Syndrome Foundation's Family Network and posted to the Dravet Parent & Caregiver Support Group on Facebook between May and August 2021. Deidentified information obtained included demographics and vaccination status for individuals with DS. Vaccine type, side effects, preventative measures, and changes in seizure activity following COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. For unvaccinated individuals, caregivers were asked about intent to vaccinate and reasons for their decision. RESULTS: Of 278 survey responses, 120 represented vaccinated individuals with DS (median age = 19.5 years), with 50% reporting no side effects from COVID-19 vaccination. Increased seizures following COVID-19 vaccination were reported in 16 individuals, but none had status epilepticus. Of the 158 individuals who had not received a COVID-19 vaccination, 37 were older than 12 years (i.e., eligible at time of study), and only six of these caregivers indicated intent to seek vaccination. The remaining 121 responses were caregivers to children younger than 12 years, 60 of whom indicated they would not seek COVID-19 vaccination when their child with DS became eligible. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy were fear of increased seizure activity and concerns about vaccine safety. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate COVID-19 vaccination is well tolerated by individuals with DS. One main reason for vaccine hesitancy was fear of increased seizure activity, which occurred in only 13% of vaccinated individuals, and none had status epilepticus. This study provides critical and reassuring insights for caregivers and health care providers making decisions about the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations for individuals with DS.
39889455	Effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Patients With Dravet Syndrome: A Case Series and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: This case series and meta-analysis aimed to determine effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). METHODS: All patients with DS and VNS were included in this case series. For meta-analysis, a literature search of electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed. Critical Appraisal Tools were used to evaluate study quality. Responder (>50% seizure reduction from baseline) rate was the main outcome, which was quantitatively synthesized at specific follow-up points (at least six months). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on duration of epilepsy, proportion of males, and duration of follow-up. Additionally, cognitive and behavior changes were analyzed as secondary outcomes in case series only. RESULTS: Of the case series, two of four patients responded. In the meta-analysis, of 1183 studies retrieved in the initial search, nine comprising 92 patients were included. The overall responder rate reached 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.64). Subgroup analyses were performed. The responder rates in groups with duration of epilepsy groups greater than or equal to six years and less than six years were 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.61) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.82) (P = 0.07). No heterogeneity was found in responder rate in groups with different proportion of males (>50%, <=50%) or two groups with different duration of follow-up (greater than or equal to three years, less than three years) (P > 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: VNS was an effective option in patients with DS who failed to respond to medications. Patients with short duration of epilepsy (less than six years) were prone to respond to VNS.
34268891	Late diagnoses of Dravet syndrome: How many individuals are we missing?	We report new genetic diagnoses of Dravet syndrome in a group of adults with complex epilepsy of unknown cause, under follow-up at a tertiary epilepsy center. Individuals with epilepsy and other features of unknown cause from our unit underwent whole-genome sequencing through the 100 000 Genomes Project. Virtual gene panels were applied to frequency-filtered variants based on phenotype summary. Of 1078 individuals recruited, 8 (0.74%) were identified to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in SCN1A. Variant types were as follows: nonsense (stopgain) in five (62.5%) and missense in three (37.5%). Detailed review of childhood history confirmed a phenotype compatible with Dravet syndrome. Median age at genetic diagnosis was 44.5 years (range 28-52 years). Tonic-clonic seizures were ongoing in all despite polytherapy including valproate. All had a history of fever sensitivity and myoclonic seizures, which were ongoing in two (25%) and three (37.5%) individuals, respectively. Salient features of Dravet syndrome may be less apparent in adulthood, making clinical diagnosis difficult. Regardless of age, benefits of a genetic diagnosis include access to syndrome-specific treatment options, avoidance of harmful drugs, and monitoring for common complications.
32193085	Vaccination management in an asymptomatic child with a novel SCN1A variant and family history of status epilepticus following vaccination: A case report on a potential new direction in personalised medicine.	PURPOSE: SCN1A variants cause a spectrum of epilepsy syndromes from Dravet Syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy of early infancy to the milder disorder of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). These genetic epilepsies are associated with increased risk of poor outcome including complications of status epilepticus and early mortality. Individualised management of young children known to be at increased risk should be considered, such as around vaccination management. METHODS: We describe two siblings with a novel pathogenic SCN1A variant, their management and clinical outcomes following routine childhood vaccinations. RESULTS: The index case who had a family history of epilepsy of unknown genetic aetiology, died from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy following his 12-month vaccinations, in the context of status epilepticus and enterovirus 71 infection. The sibling of the index case with the same SCN1A variant was subsequently managed with prophylactic regular sodium valproate and additional clobazam post vaccination to reduce the risk of seizure. She has successfully completed the childhood immunisations to 18 months with no seizures and normal neurodevelopmental progress. CONCLUSION: As the aetiology of genetic epilepsies is increasingly known in early childhood, opportunities to personalise care, minimise risks and optimise outcomes are changing. Further research is needed on the risks and benefits of symptomatic and preventative management of seizures around vaccinations in young children with genetic epilepsies.
38394831	CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.	The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.
32040850	Adjunctive Cannabidiol in Patients with Dravet Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety.	BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome (DS) is one of the most severe forms of drug-resistant epilepsy and available interventions fail to control seizures in most patients. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the first in a new class of antiepileptic drugs with a distinctive chemical structure and mechanism of action. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CBD as adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with DS using meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. Main outcomes included >= 50% reduction in baseline convulsive seizure frequency and the incidence of treatment withdrawal and adverse events (AEs). Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated through the inverse variance method. RESULTS: Three trials were included involving 359 participants, 228 for CBD and 131 for placebo groups. In all trials, the active treatment was a plant-derived pharmaceutical formulation of purified CBD oral solution. The pooled RR for 50% response during the treatment was 1.69 (95% CI 1.21-2.36; p = 0.002). Across the trials, treatment was discontinued in 20 (9.0%) and 3 (2.3%) cases in the add-on CBD and placebo groups, respectively; the RR for CBD withdrawal was 3.12 (95% CI 1.07-9.10; p = 0.037). The RR to develop any AE during add-on CBD treatment was 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.28; p = 0.561). AEs significantly associated with adjunctive CBD were somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and increased serum aminotransferases. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive CBD resulted in a greater reduction in convulsive seizure frequency than placebo and a higher rate of AEs in patients with DS presenting with seizures uncontrolled by concomitant antiepileptic therapy.
34486101	Cannabidiol for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome: experts' recommendations for its use in clinical practice in Spain.	INTRODUCTION: Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the main components of the cannabis plant that has demonstrated anti-epileptic seizure effect. Following its clinical development, in September 2019 the European Medicines Agency approved its indication for the adjunctive therapy of epileptic seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS), combined with clobazam (CLB), in patients of 2 years of age and older. AIM: To establish recommendations on the use of plant-derived highly purified CBD on which Spanish experts have reached consensus for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with DS and LGS based on their clinical experience and the scientific evidence. DEVELOPMENT: Consensus meeting with the participation of four Spanish neurologists and neuropediatric who are experts in epilepsy secondary to DS and LGS and with clinical experience in the use and management of CBD. They discussed on several topics, including posology (starting dose, dose escalation schema), efficacy (assessment of outcomes and indications for treatment withdrawal), and safety (evaluation, drug-drug interactions, adverse events management). CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimise CBD treatment, a slow dose escalation (= 4 weeks) is recommended until the maximum recommended dose or the desire effect is reached. It is also recommended that the concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) be reduced in case of adverse events due to interactions, and that the treatment continues for at least 6 months if it is well tolerated. The efficacy and safety of CBD must be assessed individually, considering the benefits and risks for individual patients.
31318844	Impact of CYP2C19 Phenotypes on Clinical Efficacy of Stiripentol in Japanese Patients With Dravet Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Stiripentol is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. This study compared the effect of stiripentol on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam and N-desmethyl-clobazam (NCLB; an active metabolite of clobazam) between different CYP2C19 phenotypes. We also evaluated the clinical impact of CYP2C19 phenotypes in Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome receiving a combination of valproic acid, clobazam, and stiripentol. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 241 blood samples from 64 patients (aged 1-40 years) and calculated the concentration/dose (CD) ratio [serum level (ng/mL) divided by dose (mg/kg)] for clobazam and NCLB. Based on their CYP2C19 genotypes, patients were classified as extensive metabolizers (EM group: CYP2C19*1/*1, *1/*2, or *1/*3) or poor metabolizers (PM group: CYP2C19*2/*2, *3/*3, or *2/*3). We also reviewed the clinical records of 56 patients who commenced stiripentol therapy and calculated the retention rate for stiripentol therapy over an observation period of 208 weeks. RESULTS: Concomitant administration of stiripentol led to a marked increase in the CD ratio of clobazam (1.8-fold in the EM group and 1.5-fold in the PM group). In addition, stiripentol increased the CD ratio of NCLB by 6.6-fold in the EM group, but decreased it by 0.7-fold in the PM group. The estimated retention rate with stiripentol therapy was higher, and the duration of retention was longer in the EM group than in the PM group (1378 versus 933 days, P < 0.001). In patients with the PM phenotype, the adjusted hazard ratio for ceasing stiripentol therapy was 6.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-24.7, P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of stiripentol on the pharmacokinetics of NCLB was significantly different between patients with the EM and PM phenotypes, which could influence the clinical response of Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome receiving the combination of valproic acid, clobazam, and stiripentol.
39501537	Cannabidiol Treatment for Adult Patients with Drug-Resistant Epilepsies: A Real-World Study in a Tertiary Center.	"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Around 30% of patients with epilepsy show drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into ""authorized"" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and ""off-label"" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings."
38183688	Caregiver-reported outcomes with real-world use of cannabidiol in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome from the BECOME survey.	PURPOSE: Plant-derived highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) reduced the frequency of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) and improved the overall condition of patients in placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials. Anecdotal reports also suggest a positive effect on nonseizure outcomes. In this study, we aimed to identify, through a caregiver survey which nonseizure outcomes were most likely to change in these patients. METHODS: The BEhavior, COgnition, and More with Epidiolex  (BECOME) was a 20-minute, cross-sectional, online survey that was developed with extensive input from caregivers, healthcare professionals, and epilepsy researchers, and was based on questions from validated measures and previously published caregiver reports. US-based caregivers (from Jazz Pharmaceuticals patient/caregiver database) of people with LGS or DS who were treated with CBD (Epidiolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) for >=3 months were asked to compare the past month to the period before CBD initiation and rate their impression of changes using symmetrical Likert scales. RESULTS: A total of 498 caregivers (97% parents) of patients with LGS (80%) or DS (20%) completed the survey. Mean (range) age of patients was 16 (1-73) years, and 52% were male. Patients were taking a median CBD dose of 14 mg/kg/d and median 4 concomitant antiseizure medications. A large proportion of respondents reported improvements in >=1 survey question for all nonseizure-related domains: alertness, cognition, and executive function (85%); emotional functioning (82%); language and communication (79% in nonverbal patients and 74% in verbal); activities of daily living (51%); sleep (51%); and physical functioning (46%). Respondents reported improvements in seizure-related domains, including overall seizure frequency (85%), overall seizure severity (76%), seizure-free days per week for >=1 seizure type (67%), and seizure freedom during the past month (16%). The majority of respondents who reported reduction in seizure frequency also reported improvements in nonseizure outcomes domains (51-80%). However, improvements in nonseizure outcomes (18-56%) were also reported in patients who either had no change or worsening of seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This survey characterized and quantified caregiver impression of changes in the seizure and nonseizure outcomes in patients taking add-on CBD treatment. Overall, 93% of caregivers reported planning to continue CBD treatment, primarily because of reduced seizure burden but also because of improvements in nonseizure-related outcomes. Despite the limitations that are associated with a retrospective survey-based study design, these results support further evaluation of the effect of CBD treatment on nonseizure outcomes among patients with LGS or DS.
34922162	Vaccination and childhood epilepsies.	INTRODUCTION: The evidence relating vaccination to febrile seizures and epilepsy is evaluated with an emphasis on febrile seizures (FS), Dravet syndrome (DS), West syndrome, and other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. METHODS: A systematic literature review using search words vaccination/immunization AND febrile seizures/epilepsy/Dravet/epileptic encephalopathy/developmental encephalopathy was performed. The role of vaccination as the cause/trigger/aggravation factor for FS or epilepsies and preventive measures were analyzed. RESULTS: From 1428 results, 846 duplicates and 447 irrelevant articles were eliminated; 120 were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that vaccinations cause epilepsy in healthy populations. Vaccinations do not cause epileptic encephalopathies but may be non-specific triggers to seizures in underlying structural or genetic etiologies. The first seizure in DS may be earlier in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients, but developmental outcome is similar in both groups. Children with a personal or family history of FS or epilepsy should receive all routine vaccinations. This recommendation includes DS. The known risks of the infectious diseases prevented by immunization are well established. Vaccination should be deferred in case of acute illness. Acellular pertussis DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is recommended. The combination of certain vaccine types may increase the risk of febrile seizures however the public health benefit of separating immunizations has not been proven. Measles-containing vaccine should be administered at age 12-15 months. Routine prophylactic antipyretics are not indicated, as there is no evidence of decreased FS risk and they can attenuate the antibody response following vaccination. Prophylactic measures (preventive antipyretic medication) are recommended in DS due to the increased risk of prolonged seizures with fever.
36066395	Stiripentol add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2014 and last updated in 2020. For nearly 30% of people with epilepsy, current treatments do not control seizures. Stiripentol is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that was developed in France and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2007 as an adjunctive therapy with valproate and clobazam for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are taking AEDs. SEARCH METHODS: For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE on 28 March 2022. We contacted the manufacturer of stiripentol and epilepsy experts to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of add-on stiripentol in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We investigated outcomes including 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, adverse effects, treatment withdrawal and changes in quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of our selection criteria, we included no new studies in the present review update. We included only one study from the original review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study adopted a responder-enriched design and found no clear evidence of a reduction of 50% or more in seizure frequency (risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 2.82; low-certainty evidence) and no clear evidence of seizure freedom (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) when comparing add-on stiripentol with placebo. Stiripentol led to a greater risk of adverse effects considered as a whole (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.47; low-certainty evidence). When we considered specific adverse effects, CIs were very wide and showed the possibility of substantial increases and small reductions in risks of neurological adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.88 to 8.01; low-certainty evidence). Researchers noted no clear reduction in the risk of study withdrawal (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47; low-certainty evidence), which was high in both groups (53.3% in placebo group and 35.3% in stiripentol group; low-certainty evidence). The external validity of this study was limited because only responders to stiripentol (i.e. participants experiencing a decrease in seizure frequency of 50% or greater during an open prerandomisation phase compared with baseline) were included in the randomised, add-on, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase. Furthermore, carry-over and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes related to seizure frequency. Very limited information derived from the only included study shows that adverse effects considered as a whole may occur more often with add-on stiripentol than with add-on placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have found no new studies since the last version of this review was published. Hence, we have made no changes to the conclusions as presented in previous versions. We can draw no conclusions to support the use of stiripentol as add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Additional large, randomised, well-conducted trials are needed.
37712490	Long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk factors of ketogenic diet for pediatric refractory epilepsy: Experience from a tertiary care center in China.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk in children with drug-resistant epilepsy who achieved seizure freedom on a ketogenic diet (KD). Predictors associated with seizure recurrence were also evaluated. METHODS: Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who received KD therapy for at least three months between May 2011 and April 2020 were included. The clinical efficacy of the KD was evaluated. Patients who achieved seizure freedom for at least three months on the KD were focused. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to explore the risk factors of seizure relapse in patients who achieved seizure freedom. RESULTS: This study included 288 patients (163 males, 125 females). The seizure-free rates of the KD at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 9.7%, 16.7%, 14.2%, and 9.0%, respectively. Additionally, the seizure reduction rates between 50% and 99% were 46.5%, 39.9%, 30.2%, and 20.5%, respectively. Patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) showed the highest efficacy rate, followed by those with Dravet syndrome (DS). Fifty-one patients achieved at least three months of seizure freedom on the KD. Seizures recurred in 24 (47.1%) patients. None of the patients with AS relapsed, while those with DS had the highest recurrence rate. The etiology of epilepsy, KD maintenance treatment period, and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities during follow-up differed significantly between patients with and without recurrence. However, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that a KD maintenance treatment period of less than 12 months and the presence of EEG abnormalities during follow-up were significantly correlated with a higher risk of relapse. Epilepsy control was restored in 3 of the 24 (12.5%) patients who experienced relapse. SIGNIFICANCE: KD appears to be effective in children with various types of drug-resistant epilepsy. A short KD maintenance treatment period and EEG abnormalities during follow-up were associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence.
39636684	Antiseizure medication prescribing in people with Dravet syndrome: An analysis of real-time administrative data.	Since 2018, three new antiseizure medications (ASMs) received FDA approval for Dravet syndrome (DS) in the U.S: cannabidiol, stiripentol, and fenfluramine. Yet, the uptake of these ASMs in routine clinical practice is unknown. We use new ICD-10 codes for DS (implemented in 2020) to estimate ASM receipt in patients with DS. We analyzed the TriNetX Network, a real-time electronic health record-based dataset linked to prescription data encompassing all 50 states of the U.S. After identifying patients with health care encounters for DS in 2021 and 2022 (via ICD-10 codes), we examined ASM prescribing in the year following a DS claim: 2022 and 2023, respectively. We retrieved 387 and 451 patients receiving claims for DS in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Clobazam, diazepam, valproate, midazolam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, and cannabidiol were the most common ASMs used (29%-44%). Stiripentol and fenfluramine prescribing was limited (7%-16%); these two ASMs, considered second-line therapies in DS, were prescribed less often than ASMs considered third-line or beyond. Cannabidiol, stiripentol, and fenfluramine prescribing rates remained nearly identical in the 2021 and 2022 cohorts. Our data suggests that stiripentol, fenfluramine, and, to an extent, cannabidiol may be underused in a large, diverse, primarily U.S.-based population of patients with DS. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In an analysis of routinely-collected health care claims in the U.S., we found that the uptake of new antiseizure medications for Dravet Syndrome (i.e., stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol) has been limited since 2022. Even though stiripentol and fenfluramine are considered second-line treatments for Dravet syndrome, we found they were prescribed less frequently than medicines considered third-line or beyond. These findings raise concern for underutilization of new antiseizure medications for Dravet syndrome in the United States.
31630399	Long-term efficacy of add-on stiripentol treatment in children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory epilepsies: A single center prospective observational study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol (STP) as an adjunctive treatment in different forms of refractory epilepsies. METHODS: The medical records of all individuals consecutively treated with STP as add-on therapy for refractory epilepsies, irrespective of their being focal, generalized, or both, and followed at Meyer Children's Hospital between January 2007 and May 2018, were reviewed. The drug scheme administration consisted of a starting dose of STP of 10-15 mg/kg/d with increments every week, up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d, based on both age and weight. Etiology of epilepsy was codified as structural, genetic, infectious, immune, metabolic, and unknown. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a seizure frequency reduction of >=50%. Retention rate was defined as the probability of continuing STP without additional therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reporting adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 132 individuals aged from 5 months to 43 years received add-on STP, including 30 patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). The median follow-up was 14.8 months (range = 4 months-18 years, interquartile range = 25.72). Twenty-nine individuals (22%) received more than two antiepileptic drugs. Benzodiazepines, mainly clobazam, were the most commonly used add-on drugs. Sixty-six patients (50%) were responders, and 13 of them (9.8%) were seizure-free. Responder rate was higher in the genetic etiology group (57%), especially in DS (18/30; 60%), and in patients with refractory focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (5/15; 33%). The median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the 66 responders. The median time to STP failure was 24.6 months in all 132 individuals. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms the long-term efficacy of add-on STP treatment in patients with different types of refractory epilepsies, including focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Further confirmations based on prospectively designed studies are required to confirm STP efficacy in focal epilepsy.
38581234	Gene replacement therapies for inherited disorders of neurotransmission: Current progress in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.	Neurodevelopment is a highly organized and complex process involving lasting and often irreversible changes in the central nervous system. Inherited disorders of neurotransmission (IDNT) are a group of genetic disorders where neurotransmission is primarily affected, resulting in abnormal brain development from early life, manifest as neurodevelopmental disorders and other chronic conditions. In principle, IDNT (particularly those of monogenic causes) are amenable to gene replacement therapy via precise genetic correction. However, practical challenges for gene replacement therapy remain major hurdles for its translation from bench to bedside. We discuss key considerations for the development of gene replacement therapies for IDNT. As an example, we describe our ongoing work on gene replacement therapy for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, a GABA catabolic disorder.
37120555	Sleep quality, anxiety, symptoms of depression, and caregiver burden among those caring for patients with Dravet syndrome: a prospective multicenter study in Germany.	BACKGROUND: This study measured sleep quality among caregivers of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and assessed the impacts of mental health problems and caregiver burden on sleep quality. METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study of patients with DS and their caregivers throughout Germany consisted of a questionnaire and a prospective 4-week diary querying disease characteristics, demographic data, living conditions, nocturnal supervision, and caregivers' work situations. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleeping Quality Index (PSQI). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC) were used to measure anxiety, symptoms of depression, and caregiver burden. RESULTS: Our analysis included 108 questionnaires and 82 four-week diaries. Patients with DS were 49.1% male (n = 53), with a mean age of 13.5 +- 10.0 years. Caregivers were 92.6% (n = 100) female, with a mean age of 44.7 +- 10.6 years. The overall mean PSQI score was 8.7 +- 3.5, with 76.9% of participants (n = 83) scoring 6 or higher, indicating abnormal sleep quality. The HADS for anxiety and depression had overall mean scores of 9.3 +- 4.3 and 7.9 +- 3.7, respectively; 61.8% and 50.9% of participants scored above the cutoff value of 8 for anxiety and depression, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed caregiver anxiety levels and patients' sleep disturbances as major factors influencing PSQI scores. The overall mean BSFC score of 41.7 +- 11.7 indicates a moderate burden, with 45.3% of caregivers scoring 42 or higher. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality is severely affected among caregivers of patients with DS, correlating with anxiety, comorbidities, and patients' sleep disturbances. A holistic therapeutic approach should be implemented for patients with DS and their caregivers, focusing on the sleep quality and mental health of caregivers.

32049739	What has been the impact of new drug treatments on epilepsy?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nearly two dozen antiseizure medications (ASMs) with different mechanisms of action have been introduced over the past three decades with the aim of providing better efficacy or safety profile than the previous drugs. Several new ASMs with improvement on a classic drug family or have novel mechanisms of action have been recently approved for epilepsy. The present review explored recent studies or guidelines on new agents and discussed the potential impact of these novel treatments on epilepsy management and future directions of research. RECENT FINDINGS: Long-term cohort studies showed that, collectively, the second-generation did not improve the overall prognosis of epilepsy. Individual monotherapy studies showed similar efficacy of second-generation (levetiracetam and zonisamide) and third-generation (eslicarbazepine acetate and lacosamide) ASMs compared to controlled-release carbamazepine for the treatment of focal epilepsy. However, there appears to be no evidence to support any second-generation or third-generation ASMs to be as efficacious as valproate monotherapy for generalized and unclassified epilepsies. Cannabidiol adjunctive treatments were found to be efficacious for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although most newer generation ASMs are less prone to drug-drug interactions, stiripentol and cannabidiol can elevate the plasma concentration of N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. Generally speaking, the second-generation ASMs have lower teratogenic risk than the older drugs but there is scant study on neurodevelopmental effect of third-generation ASMs. SUMMARY: Although the newer generation ASMs may not have improved the overall seizure control they have advantages in terms of drug-drug interactions and teratogenicity, and thus offer valuable individualized options in the treatment of epilepsy.
34338318	Defining Dravet syndrome: An essential pre-requisite for precision medicine trials.	OBJECTIVE: The classical description of Dravet syndrome, the prototypic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, is of a normal 6-month-old infant presenting with a prolonged, febrile, hemiclonic seizure and showing developmental slowing after age 1 year. SCN1A pathogenic variants are found in >80% of patients. Many patients have atypical features resulting in diagnostic delay and inappropriate therapy. We aimed to provide an evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome in readiness for precision medicine trials. METHODS: Epilepsy patients were recruited to the University of Melbourne Epilepsy Genetics Research Program between 1995 and 2020 by neurologists from around the world. Patients with SCN1A pathogenic variants were reviewed and only those with Dravet syndrome were included. Clinical data, including seizure and developmental course, were analyzed in all patients with SCN1A-Dravet syndrome. RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients were studied at a median age of 8.5 years (range 10 months to 60 years); 25 were deceased. The median seizure-onset age was 5.7 months (range 1.5-20.6 months). Initial seizures were tonic-clonic (52%) and hemiclonic (35%), with only 55% being associated with fever. Only 34% of patients presented with status epilepticus (seizure lasting >=30 minutes). Median time between first and second seizure was 30 days (range 4 hours to 8 months), and seven patients (5%) had at least 6 months between initial seizures. Median ages at onset of second and third seizure types were 9.1 months (range 3 months-25.4 years) and 15.5 months (range 4 months-8.2 years), respectively. Developmental slowing occurred prior to 12 months in 27%. SIGNIFICANCE: An evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome is essential for early diagnosis. We refine the spectrum of Dravet syndrome, based on patterns of seizure onset, type, and progression. Understanding of the full spectrum of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome presentation is essential for early diagnosis and optimization of treatment, especially as precision medicine trials become available.
31904119	Dravet syndrome: Treatment options and management of prolonged seizures.	Over time, with careful delineation of Dravet syndrome, we have gained experience in treatments most likely to lead to improvement in seizures, as well as those that should be avoided. Sodium valproate, clobazam, stiripentol, and topiramate are all medications that may lead to benefit, as well as the ketogenic diet. Bromides may be utilized in resistant cases. However, equally important are outlining prompt rescue treatment for prolonged seizures and avoidance of precipitants. Newer agents including cannabidiol and fenfluramine have been demonstrated to be of benefit in clinical trials. We propose an algorithm for management, but appreciate that the positioning of newer agents is yet to be established.
31981099	From Genetic Testing to Precision Medicine in Epilepsy.	"Epilepsy includes a number of medical conditions with recurrent seizures as common denominator. The large number of different syndromes and seizure types as well as the highly variable inter-individual response to the therapies makes management of this condition often challenging. In the last two decades, a genetic etiology has been revealed in more than half of all epilepsies and single gene defects in ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors have been associated with most inherited forms of epilepsy, including some focal and lesional forms as well as specific epileptic developmental encephalopathies. Several genetic tests are now available, including targeted assays up to revolutionary tools that have made sequencing of all coding (whole exome) and non-coding (whole genome) regions of the human genome possible. These recent technological advances have also driven genetic discovery in epilepsy and increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many epileptic disorders, eventually providing targets for precision medicine in some syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome, pyroxidine-dependent epilepsy, and glucose transporter 1 deficiency. However, these examples represent a relatively small subset of all types of epilepsy, and to date, precision medicine in epilepsy has primarily focused on seizure control, and other clinical aspects, such as neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, have yet been possible to address. We herein summarize the most recent advances in genetic testing and provide up-to-date approaches for the choice of the correct test for some epileptic disorders and tailored treatments that are already applicable in some monogenic epilepsies. In the next years, the most probably scenario is that epilepsy treatment will be very different from the currently almost empirical approach, eventually with a ""precision medicine"" approach applicable on a large scale."
33612344	Revaccination outcomes of children with vaccine proximate seizures.	BACKGROUND: Seizures, whether febrile or afebrile, occurring within 14 days following vaccination can be considered as vaccine proximate seizures (VPSs). While the attributable risk and clinical severity of first febrile VPS is well known, the risk and clinical outcomes of VPS recurrence is less well defined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of revaccination management and outcomes in children who experienced a VPS as their first seizure seen in Australian Specialist Immunisation Clinics between 2013 and 2017. Vaccination outcomes were compared between children who had a VPS as their only seizure (VPS only) and children who had further non-vaccine proximate seizures following their initial VPS (VPS+) prior to review at the clinic. RESULTS: We identified 119 children with a VPS as their first seizure, of which 61 (51%) went on to have other seizures (VPS+). Children with VPS+ were more likely to present at a younger age (6.2 vs 12.5 months, P = 0.03), with afebrile seizures (42.6% vs 15.5%, P = 0.002) compared to VPS only children. VPS recurrence on revaccination was uncommon in both groups, but more common in VPS+ children (12.5% vs 2.4%, P = 0.07). Having an epilepsy diagnosis, specifically Dravet syndrome, was associated with VPS recurrence (P < 0.001). Of the four children with Dravet syndrome who had VPS recurrence, all had status epilepticus following revaccination. CONCLUSION: In children who presented with a single VPS as their only seizure, VPS recurrence on revaccination was uncommon. Children who had multiple non-vaccine proximate seizures following their initial VPS (VPS+) were more likely to present with afebrile VPS, at a younger age and have a VPS recurrence with vaccination. In these children, particularly those aged < 12 months, assessment and investigation for diagnosis of Dravet syndrome should be considered and additional precautions for revaccination undertaken as they are at highest risk of VPS recurrence.
35303699	The role of vagus nerve stimulation in genetic etiologies of drug-resistant epilepsy: a meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affects many children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.
39393142	Neuromodulation strategies in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.	Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.
34813019	CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Gene Therapy in Neurological Disorders.	Neurological disorders are primarily diseases with sophisticated etiology that are always refractory and recrudescent. The major obstruction to effective therapies for neurological disorders is the poor understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which allows precise and effective gene editing in almost any cell type and organism, is accelerating the pace of basic biological research. An increasing number of groups are focusing on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of neurological disorders and developing novel therapies using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This review highlights the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the treatment of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Dravet syndrome, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Hopefully, it will improve our understanding of neurological disorders and give insights into future treatments for neurological disorders.
35156171	A Practical Guide to the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome with Anti-Seizure Medication.	"Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterised by refractory seizures and cognitive dysfunction. The treatment is challenging, not least because the seizures are highly drug resistant, requiring multiple anti-seizure medications (ASMs), while some ASMs can exacerbate seizures. Initial treatments include the broad-spectrum ASMs valproate (VPA), and clobazam (CLB) in some regions; however, they are generally insufficient to control seizures. With this in mind, three adjunct ASMs have been approved specifically for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome: stiripentol (STP) in 2007 in the European Union and 2018 in the USA, cannabidiol (CBD) in 2018/2019 (in combination with CLB in the European Union) and fenfluramine (FFA) in 2020. These ""add-on"" therapies (mostly to VPA/CLB) are used as escalation therapies, with the choice dependent on availability in different countries, patient characteristics and caregiver preferences. Topiramate is also frequently used, with evidence of efficacy in Dravet syndrome, and there is anecdotal evidence of efficacy with bromide, which is frequently used in Germany and Japan. With a growing treatment landscape for Dravet syndrome, there can be practical challenges for clinicians, particularly with issues associated with polypharmacy. This practical guide provides an overview of these main ASMs including their indications/contraindications, mechanism of action, efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosage requirements, and laboratory and clinical parameters to be evaluated. Standard laboratory and clinical parameters include blood counts, liver function tests, serum concentrations of ASMs, monitoring the growth of children, as well as weight loss and acceleration of behavioural problems. Regular cardiac monitoring is also important with FFA as it has previously been associated with cases of cardiac valve disease when used in adults at high doses (up to 120 mg/day) in combination with phentermine as a therapy for obesity. Importantly, no signs of heart valve disease have been documented to date at the low doses used in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. In addition, potential drug-drug interactions and their consequences are a key consideration in everyday practice. Interactions that potentially require dosage adjustments to alleviate adverse events include the following: STP + CLB resulting in increased plasma concentrations of CLB and its active metabolite norclobazam may increase somnolence, and an interaction with STP and VPA may increase gastrointestinal adverse events. Cannabidiol has a bi-directional interaction with CLB producing an increase in plasma concentrations of 7-OH-CBD and norclobazam resulting in the potential for increased somnolence and sedation. In addition, CBD is associated with elevations of liver transaminases particularly in patients taking concomitant VPA. The interaction between FFA and STP requires a dose reduction of FFA. Furthermore, concomitant administration of VPA with topiramate has been associated with encephalopathy and/or hyperammonaemia. Finally, we briefly describe other ASMs used in Dravet syndrome, and current key clinical trials."
32614070	Thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients on concurrent cannabidiol and valproic acid.	In January 2019, a new plant-derived purified cannabidiol preparation, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, became commercially available for patients >=2 years old with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Among our patients who were prescribed the new cannabidiol formulation, we observed several cases of thrombocytopenia and therefore embarked on this study. We conducted a single-center systematic chart review of all pediatric patients (<21 years old) who were prescribed cannabidiol from January to August 2019. We evaluated salient features of the patients' epilepsy syndrome, age, concurrent medications, and surveillance laboratory results before and after cannabidiol initiation. Among 87 patients, nine (10%) developed thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir range = 17 000-108 000) following initiation of cannabidiol. Each of these nine children was on combination therapy of cannabidiol with valproic acid. Whereas no children on cannabidiol without valproic acid (0/57) developed thrombocytopenia, nine of 23 treated with combination valproic acid and cannabidiol developed platelets < 110 000/microL (P < .0001). We report a novel and clinically important side effect of thrombocytopenia in one-third of patients treated concurrently with cannabidiol and valproic acid. If this finding is confirmed, clinicians should perform close monitoring for thrombocytopenia when adding cannabidiol to a regimen that includes valproic acid.
39215723	Pharmacological management of prolonged seizures in Dravet syndrome including intravenous phenytoin.	Dravet syndrome (DS) is an infantile onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Sodium channel blockers are known to exacerbate seizures in this syndrome. Due to its high incidence, the management of prolonged seizures is crucial for DS patients. There is still ambiguity regarding the use of intravenous phenytoin for prolonged seizure in DS patients mainly due to the lack of data, raising concern about the safety of it use. We conducted a retrospective study (from January 2009 to January 2020) aiming to assess the management of prolonged seizures in DS with a focus on the use of intravenous phenytoin. Data were collected for patients admitted to our hospital for seizures lasting >5 min. Among 52 identified patients in our database, 23 experienced 59 prolonged seizures managed in our hospital. Only four seizures ceased without rescue medication. Notably, the use of intravenous phenytoin was not associated with discernible adverse effects and was effective in stopping status epilepticus in 71% of cases. This study suggests the safety and efficacy of intravenous phenytoin for prolonged seizure in DS. There is a need for broader investigations of emergency treatments for evidence-based recommendations for the emergency plan of each patient.
38167335	Switching from zonisamide to perampanel improved the frequency of seizures caused by hyperthermia in Dravet syndrome: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe epilepsy disorder characterized by drug-resistant seizures and cognitive dysfunction, often caused by SCN1A gene mutations. It leads to neurodevelopmental delays and motor, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, with a high mortality rate. Treatment options include sodium valproate, clobazam, and newer agents such as cannabidiol and fenfluramine. Zonisamide, which is used in some cases, can cause hyperthermia and oligohydrosis. Herein, we present a case of a patient with Dravet syndrome whose seizures were controlled by treating infections and switching from zonisamide to perampanel. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Japanese man with Dravet syndrome presented to our department with aspiration pneumonia. The patient had been treated with valproate, sodium bromide, and zonisamide for a long time. His seizures were triggered by hyperthermia. The patient was experiencing a sustained pattern of hyperthermia caused by infection, zonisamide, and persistent convulsions, which caused a vicious cycle of further seizures. In this case, the control of infection and switching from zonisamide to perampanel improved seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: Dravet syndrome usually begins with generalized clonic seizures in its infancy because of fever and progresses to various seizure types, often triggered by fever or seizure-induced heat due to mutations in the SCN1A gene that increases neuronal excitability. Seizures usually diminish with age, but the heat sensitivity remains. In this case, seizures were increased by repeated infections, and hyperthermia was induced by zonisamide, resulting in status epilepticus. Perampanel, an aminomethylphosphonic acid receptor antagonist, decreased seizures but caused psychiatric symptoms. It was effective in suppressing seizures of Dravet syndrome in this patient.
32592183	Cannabidiol efficacy independent of clobazam: Meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) with and without concomitant clobazam (CLB) was evaluated in stratified analyses of four large randomized controlled trials, two in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and two in Dravet syndrome. METHODS: Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex  in the US; Epidyolex  in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.
38427284	Comparative efficacy and safety of stiripentol, cannabidiol and fenfluramine as first-line add-on therapies for seizures in Dravet syndrome: A network meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol are licensed add-on therapies to treat seizures in Dravet Syndrome (DS). There are no direct or indirect comparisons assessing their full licensed dose regimens, across different jurisdictions, as first-line add-on therapies in DS. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and frequentist network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data for licensed add-on DS therapies. We compared the proportions of patients experiencing: reductions from baseline in monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF) of >=50% (clinically meaningful), >=75% (profound), and 100% (seizure-free); serious adverse events (SAEs); discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: We identified relevant data from two placebo-controlled RCTs for each drug. Stiripentol 50 mg/kg/day and fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day had similar efficacy in achieving >=50% (clinically meaningful) and >=75% (profound) reductions from baseline in MCSF (absolute risk difference [RD] for stiripentol versus fenfluramine 1% [95% confidence interval: -20% to 22%; p = 0.93] and 6% [-15% to 27%; p = 0.59], respectively), and both were statistically superior (p < 0.05) to licensed dose regimens of cannabidiol (10 or 20 mg/kg/day, with/irrespective of clobazam) for these outcomes. Stiripentol was statistically superior in achieving seizure-free intervals compared to fenfluramine (RD = 26% [CI: 8% to 44%; p < 0.01]) and licensed dose regimens of cannabidiol. There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients experiencing SAEs. The risk of discontinuations due to AEs was lower for stiripentol, although the stiripentol trials were shorter. SIGNIFICANCE: This NMA of RCT data indicates stiripentol, as a first-line add-on therapy in DS, is at least as effective as fenfluramine and both are more effective than cannabidiol in reducing convulsive seizures. No significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between the three add-on agents was observed, but stiripentol may have a lower risk of discontinuations due to AEs. These results may inform clinical decision-making and the continued development of guidelines for the treatment of people with DS. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study compared three drugs (stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol) used alongside other medications for managing seizures in a severe type of epilepsy called DS. The study found that stiripentol and fenfluramine were similarly effective in reducing seizures and both were more effective than cannabidiol. Stiripentol was the best drug for stopping seizures completely based on the available clinical trial data. All three drugs had similar rates of serious side effects, but stiripentol had a lower chance of being stopped due to side effects. This information can help guide treatment choices for people with DS.

38203200	Clinical and Genetic Features of Dravet Syndrome: A Prime Example of the Role of Precision Medicine in Genetic Epilepsy.	Dravet syndrome (DS), also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a rare and drug-resistant form of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which is both debilitating and challenging to manage, typically arising during the first year of life, with seizures often triggered by fever, infections, or vaccinations. It is characterized by frequent and prolonged seizures, developmental delays, and various other neurological and behavioral impairments. Most cases result from pathogenic mutations in the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene, which encodes a critical voltage-gated sodium channel subunit involved in neuronal excitability. Precision medicine offers significant potential for improving DS diagnosis and treatment. Early genetic testing enables timely and accurate diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of DS's underlying genetic mechanisms and neurobiology have enabled the development of targeted therapies, such as gene therapy, offering more effective and less invasive treatment options for patients with DS. Targeted and gene therapies provide hope for more effective and personalized treatments. However, research into novel approaches remains in its early stages, and their clinical application remains to be seen. This review addresses the current understanding of clinical DS features, genetic involvement in DS development, and outcomes of novel DS therapies.
33773226	Transition from pediatric to adult care in a Japanese cohort of childhood-onset epilepsy: prevalence of epileptic syndromes and complexity in the transition.	AIM: We retrospectively examined patients with childhood-onset epilepsy who transitioned from pediatric to adult care to reveal the clinical characteristics and evaluate the complexity of transitioning. METHODS: The subjects were 220 patients (89 males, 131 females) who had been treated at our pediatric epilepsy clinic and had transferred to adult care between 2014 and 2018 without attending a transition clinic or program. The demographic data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The ages at transition ranged from 15 to 54 years (median: 27 years old). There were 91 patients with focal epilepsies (FEs) and 129 patients with generalized epilepsies [genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) n = 30, generalized epilepsy of various etiologies (GEv) n = 99]. A most frequent epileptic syndrome was temporal lobe epilepsy followed by frontal lobe epilepsy in FEs, GTCS only followed by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in GGE and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome followed by Dravet syndrome in GEv. At the age of transition, a total of 77 of the 96 patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) had pharmacoresistant seizures, which was positively correlated with a late transition age (P<=0.05). More than monthly seizures and greater than moderate disabilities were noted in 45% and 55% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The patients with childhood-onset epilepsy transitioned to adult care from the hospital-based pediatric epilepsy clinic were characterized by generalized>focal epilepsy, a frequent complication of DEE, more than monthly seizures, and worse than moderate intellectual disabilities. The complication of DEE made a smooth transition difficult and delayed the transition age.
32712377	Efficacy of the ketogenic diet in patients with Dravet syndrome: A meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is an infantile epilepsy syndrome with drug resistant seizures and cognitive impairment. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the findings of relevant published studies to identify the efficacy of a ketogenic diet in patients with Dravet syndrome and their compliance thereof, and to provide useful information for clinical practice. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and CNKI databases were searched for relevant studies published up to September 25, 2019; the included studies were reviewed. Meta-analyses were performed using R software to determine the combined efficacy rates and retention rate for the ketogenic diet in patients with Dravet syndrome. RESULTS: Seven studies involving 167 patients met the inclusion criteria: four were retrospective studies, and three were prospective studies. The meta-analysis revealed that 63 %, 60 %, and 47 % of responder patients achieved >=50 % seizure reduction at month 3, 6, and 12, respectively. The pooled retention rate of the ketogenic diet at month 6 and month 12 was 78 % and 49 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that the ketogenic diet is a treatment option for patients with Dravet syndrome. The ketogenic diet is safe and its adverse effects are mostly acceptable. However, further investigations, especially high-quality controlled trials with large samples, are required.
34642351	Clinical spectrum and the comorbidities of Dravet syndrome in Taiwan and the possible molecular mechanisms.	Dravet syndrome (DS) is an uncommon epilepsy syndrome that may negatively affect the patients and their caregivers. However, reliable and valid measures of its impact on caregivers and the characteristics of patients with DS in Taiwan are lacking. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of patients with DS and concerns of their caregivers and establish a baseline frequency of disease characteristics using a cross-sectional survey in Taiwan. We assessed the caregivers of patients with DS using an online anonymous questionnaire. The seizure frequency decreased with age, although lacking statistical significance. Vaccines show no influence on the condition of patients with DS. Our findings revealed the highest impact on the domains affecting the caregivers' daily life, including additional household tasks, symptom observation, further medical plan, and financial issues. Caregivers also expressed concerns regarding the lack of independence/constant care, seizure control, speech/communication, and impacts on siblings because of long-term care of the patients in parents' absence. Our findings highlight the significant effects of caring for a child with DS on the lives of their caregivers in Taiwan; these findings will help raise awareness regarding the needs of these families. Furthermore, we discussed the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of associated comorbidities.
32119035	Dose-Ranging Effect of Adjunctive Oral Cannabidiol vs Placebo on Convulsive Seizure Frequency in Dravet Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Clinical evidence supports effectiveness of cannabidiol for treatment-resistant seizures in Dravet syndrome, but this trial is the first to evaluate the 10-mg/kg/d dose. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol, 10 and 20 mg/kg/d, vs placebo for adjunctive treatment of convulsive seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (GWPCARE2) recruited patients from April 13, 2015, to November 10, 2017, with follow-up completed on April 9, 2018. Of 285 patients screened from 38 centers in the United States, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Australia, and Israel, 86 were excluded, and 199 were randomized. Patients were aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and at least 4 convulsive seizures during the 4-week baseline period while receiving at least 1 antiepileptic drug. Data were analyzed from November 16 (date of unblinding) to December 13 (date of final outputs), 2018, based on intention to treat and per protocol. Interventions: Patients received cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg per day (CBD10 and CBD20 groups, respectively) or matched placebo in 2 equally divided doses for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were blinded to group assignment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period. Secondary outcomes included change in all seizure frequency, proportion with at least a 50% reduction in convulsive seizure activity, and change in Caregiver Global Impression of Change score. Results: Of 198 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 9.3 [4.4] years; 104 female [52.5%]), 66 were randomized to the CBD10 group, 67 to the CBD20 group, and 65 to the placebo group, and 190 completed treatment. The percentage reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency was 48.7% for CBD10 group and 45.7% for the CBD20 group vs 26.9% for the placebo group; the percentage reduction from placebo was 29.8% (95% CI, 8.4%-46.2%; P = .01) for CBD10 group and 25.7% (95% CI, 2.9%-43.2%; P = .03) for the CBD20 group. The most common adverse events were decreased appetite, diarrhea, somnolence, pyrexia, and fatigue. Five patients in the CBD20 group discontinued owing to adverse events. Elevated liver transaminase levels occurred more frequently in the CBD20 (n = 13) than the CBD10 (n = 3) group, with all affected patients given concomitant valproate sodium. Conclusions and Relevance: Adjunctive cannabidiol at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/d led to similar clinically relevant reductions in convulsive seizure frequency with a better safety and tolerability profile for the 10-mg/kg/d dose in children with treatment-resistant Dravet syndrome. Dose increases of cannabidiol to greater than 10 mg/kg/d should be tailored to individual efficacy and safety. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02224703.
34000601	Long-term results of vagus nerve stimulation in children with Dravet syndrome: Time-dependent, delayed antiepileptic effect.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in children with pharmaco-resistant Dravet syndrome (DS). METHODS: We enrolled 22 patients with pharmaco-resistant DS who underwent VNS implantation at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2005 to October 2020. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after VNS implantation. Efficacy was measured as the percentage reduction in seizure frequency at each follow-up compared with the baseline (pre-implantation) values. RESULTS: Median patient age at VNS implantation was 10.0 years (interquartile range 7.7-13.3). The median follow-up period was 4.3 years (interquartile range 3.0-6.5) after VNS implantation. All cases were followed up for >=2 years after VNS implantation. Three (13.6 %) patients maintained seizure freedom for >=1 year. Among them, one achieved seizure freedom after 30 months of VNS. More than 50 % reduction in seizure frequency was observed in 36.4 % (8/22), 54.5 % (12/22), and 63.2 % (12/19) of the patients at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. The median percent reduction in seizure frequency was 18.8 %, 50.6 %, and 60.0 % at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Compared with the baseline value, the seizure frequency was significantly lower at 24, 30, and 36 months, as well as at the longest follow-up period (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The symptom that was mostly associated with adverse events was hoarseness (4/22, 18.2 %); however, they had temporary or minimal effects on activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that VNS therapy allows long-term, progressive, and time-dependent improvement in seizure control for pharmaco-resistant DS. Clinicians should be aware of the delayed VNS efficacy over the years and should encourage long-term VNS maintenance by patients.
32799683	Therapeutic advances in Dravet syndrome: a targeted literature review.	INTRODUCTION: Dravet syndrome (DS), a prototypic developmental and genetic epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), is characterized by an early onset of treatment-refractory seizures, together with impairments in motor control, behavior, and cognition. Even with multiple conventional anti-epileptic drugs, seizures remain poorly controlled, and there has been a considerable unmet need for effective and tolerable treatments. AREAS COVERED: This targeted literature review aims to highlight recent changes to the therapeutic landscape for DS by summarizing the most up-to-date, evidence-based research, including pivotal data from the clinical development of stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine, which are important milestones for DS treatment, together with the latest findings of other pharmacotherapies in development. In phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials stiripentol, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine have shown clinically relevant reductions in convulsive seizure frequency, and are generally well tolerated. Stiripentol was associated with responder rates (greater than 50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency) of 67%-71%, when added to valproic acid and clobazam; cannabidiol was associated with responder rates of 43%-49% (48%-63% in conjunction with clobazam), and fenfluramine of 54%-68% across studies. Therapies in development include soticlestat, ataluren, verapamil, and clemizole, with strategies to treat the underlying cause of DS, including gene therapy and antisense oligonucleotides beginning to emerge from preclinical studies. EXPERT OPINION: Despite the challenges of drug development in rare diseases, this is an exciting time for the treatment of DS, with the promise of new efficacious and well-tolerated therapies, which may pave the way for treatment advances in other DEEs.
33664205	Interictal autonomic dysfunction.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy is associated with autonomic dysfunction. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on measures of interictal autonomic function, focusing on heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and electrodermal activity (EDA). RECENT FINDINGS: Resting HRV, BRS and EDA are altered in patients with epilepsy compared with healthy controls. A larger body of work is available for HRV compared with BRS and EDA, and points to interictal HRV derangements across a wide range of epilepsies, including focal, generalized, and combined generalized and focal epilepsies. HRV alterations are most pronounced in temporal lobe epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant and chronic epilepsies. There are conflicting data on the effect of antiseizure medications on measures of interictal autonomic function. However, carbamazepine has been associated with decreased HRV. Epilepsy surgery and vagus nerve stimulation do not appear to have substantial impact on measures of interictal autonomic function but well designed studies are lacking. SUMMARY: Patients with epilepsy, particularly those with longstanding uncontrolled seizures, have measurable alterations of resting autonomic function. These alterations may be relevant to the increased risk of premature mortality in epilepsy, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, which warrants investigation in future research.
31301455	Seizure management and prescription patterns of anticonvulsants in Dravet syndrome: A multicenter cohort study from Germany and review of literature.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the treatment pattern of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) in Germany with routine antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and emergency medication, and to review the literature of real-world evidence on medicine utilization of patients with DS in Europe. METHODS: Patient use of routine AEDs and emergency medications over 3-6 months was analyzed from a 2018 multicenter survey of 93 caregivers of patients with DS throughout Germany. Results were contextualized in a review of real-world evidence on medicine utilization of patients with DS in Europe. RESULTS: The variety of medications and the most frequent combinations routinely used by patients with DS (AEDs and others) are described. Patients use a large number of pharmaceutical treatments to manage seizures. The five most commonly used AEDs were sodium valproate (66% of the patients; mean daily dose: 660 mg; 24.5 mg per kg bodyweight), bromide (44%; 1462 mg; 51.2 mg per kg), clobazam (41%; 10.4 mg; 0.32 mg per kg), stiripentol (35%; 797 mg; 27.6 mg per kg), and topiramate (24%; 107 mg; 3.5 mg per kg). Ninety percent had reported using emergency medications in the last 3 months;, with the most common medications being Buccolam (40%, an oromucosal form of midazolam) and diazepam (20%, mostly rectal application). No discernable relationships between current medication and age or seizure frequency were observed. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first comprehensive report of routine AEDs and emergency medication use in a large sample of patients with DS in Germany over a period of 3-6 months and shows that despite the most common AED combinations being in line with clinical guidelines/best practice, there is no discernable impact of best treatment on seizure frequency. We find a higher use of bromide in Germany compared with other real-world evidence in Europe.
33638459	The role of new medical treatments for the management of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: Novel concepts and results.	Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are among the most challenging of all epilepsies to manage, given the exceedingly frequent and often severe seizure types, pharmacoresistance to conventional antiseizure medications, and numerous comorbidities. During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.
39560633	WONOEP appraisal: Targeted therapy development for early onset epilepsies.	The early onset epilepsies encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which result in drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, psychiatric comorbidities, and sudden death. Advancement in the widespread use of targeted gene panels as well as genome and exome sequencing has facilitated the identification of different causative genes in a subset of these patients. The ability to recognize the genetic basis of early onset epilepsies continues to improve, with de novo coding variants accounting for most of the genetic etiologies identified. Although current disease-specific and disease-modifying therapies remain limited, novel precision medicine approaches, such as small molecules, cell therapy, and other forms of genetic therapies for early onset epilepsies, have created excitement among researchers, clinicians, and caregivers. Here, we summarize the main findings of presentations and discussions on novel therapeutic strategies for targeted treatment of early onset epilepsies that occurred during the Workshop on Neurobiology of Epilepsy (WONOEP XVI, Talloires, France, July 2022). The presentations discussed the use of chloride transporter inhibitors for neonatal seizures, targeting orexinergic signaling for childhood absence epilepsy, targeting energy metabolism in Dravet syndrome, and the role of cannabinoid receptor type 2, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cell therapies, and RNA-based therapies in early life epilepsies.
40073826	Real-world experience of cannabidiol in conjunction with clobazam for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome: Results from a retrospective multicentre chart review in Germany.	BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are rare and debilitating forms of epilepsy, characterised by recurrent, severe, drug-resistant seizures and neurodevelopmental impairments. A non-euphoric, plant-derived, highly purified formulation of cannabidiol (CBD; Epidyolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) is approved in the European Union and United Kingdom for use in patients aged >=2 years for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS in conjunction with clobazam (CLB), and for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients aged >=2 years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies who were treated with adjunctive CBD at six epilepsy centres in Germany. We analysed patient and treatment characteristics, seizure outcomes, treatment retention rates (i.e. the proportion of patients remaining on CBD treatment at time of assessment and retention as estimated by Kaplan-Meier [KM] analyses), physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and adverse events (AEs) for up to 12 months. Here, we report data from this chart review for those patients with LGS or DS receiving adjunctive treatment with concomitant CBD and CLB. RESULTS: We identified 126 patients (102 LGS; 24 DS) receiving CBD and CLB, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 23.2 (15.8) years and a mean (SD) age of epilepsy onset of 3 (3.7) years. Patients had received a median (range) number of prior antiseizure medications (ASMs) of 6 (1-24) and concomitant ASMs of 3 (1-7). The median target CBD dose was 11.1 mg/kg/day in the total population (17.8, 15.8, and 9.7 mg/kg/day in the <6 years, 6-17 years, and >=18 years subgroups, respectively). The median time to the target dose was 21-22 days across age groups. The median concomitant CLB dose was 0.14 mg/kg/day (0.38, 0.22, and 0.10 mg/kg/day in the respective age groups). A >=50% reduction in total seizures was observed in 47.5% of patients at 3 months (35.7-52.6% across age groups) and 45.5% of patients at 12 months (44.4-46.2% across age groups). For generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a >=50% reduction was observed in 63.0% of patients at 3 months (60.7-66.7% across age groups) and 56.9% of patients at 12 months (50.0-75.0% across age groups). Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 30 (range: 0.5-30) at baseline to 15 (range: 0-30) at the last follow-up (p <0.001). Overall, 89.7%, 80.7%, and 69.8% patients remained on CBD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. KM estimated treatment retention was similar across paediatric and adult groups, according to earlier or later initiation (e.g. <=4 vs >=15 prior and concomitant ASMs) and according to the syndrome (LGS and DS). Physicians rated 66% of patients demonstrated a CGI-C improvement and 67% demonstrated a CGI-C behaviour improvement. The most common AEs (>=5%) were sedation (n = 30, 23.8%), diarrhoea (n = 13, 10.3%) and psycho-behavioural AEs (n = 9, 7.1%). CONCLUSION: In this chart review of patients with severe treatment refractory LGS or DS receiving adjunctive CBD and CLB concomitantly, a reduction in seizure frequency and sustained treatment retention was observed for up to 12 months across age groups in real-world clinical practice. CBD discontinuations exclusively due to AEs were infrequent and the AE profile was generally aligned to that previously observed.
32446162	Influence of stiripentol on perampanel serum levels.	Stiripentol is an orphan drug successfully used in combination with valproate and clobazam in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Perampanel has also been added by experts. In this retrospective study, we investigated the influence of stiripentol on perampanel serum levels by using the doses and corresponding perampanel serum levels of 10 patients. The impact of stiripentol on the perampanel serum levels was significant as shown in a linear regression analysis, with perampanel serum levels increasing linearly with the stiripentol doses. We conclude that dose adjustments of stiripentol and perampanel when administered together, should be done carefully to avoid side effects or even severe intoxication. Hence, perampanel serum level monitoring seems advisable.
32468572	Stiripentol add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2014, and last updated in 2018. For nearly 30% of people with epilepsy, seizures are not controlled by current treatments. Stiripentol is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that was developed in France and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2007 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome as an adjunctive therapy with valproate and clobazam. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are taking AEDs. SEARCH METHODS: For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 27 February 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web); and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 February 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We contacted Biocodex (the manufacturer of stiripentol) and epilepsy experts to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, controlled, add-on trials of stiripentol in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We investigated outcomes including 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, adverse effects, treatment withdrawal and changes in quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of our selection criteria, we included no new studies in the present review update. We included only one study from the earlier review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study adopted a responder-enriched design and found no clear evidence of a reduction in seizure frequency (>= 50% seizure reduction) (risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 2.82; low-certainty evidence) or evidence of seizure freedom (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) when add-on stiripentol was compared with placebo. Stiripentol led to a greater risk of adverse effects considered as a whole (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.47; low-certainty evidence). When we considered specific adverse events, confidence intervals were very wide and showed the possibility of substantial increases and small reductions in risks of neurological adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.88 to 8.01; low-certainty evidence) and gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 11.56, 95% CI 0.71 to 189.36; low-certainty evidence). Researchers noted no clear reduction in the risk of study withdrawal (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47; low-certainty evidence), which was high in both groups (35.0% in add-on placebo and 53.3% in stiripentol group; low-certainty evidence). The external validity of this study was limited because only responders to stiripentol (i.e. patients experiencing a >= 50% decrease in seizure frequency compared with baseline) were included in the randomised, add-on, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase. Furthermore, carry-over and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes related to seizure frequency. Very limited information derived from the only included study shows that adverse effects considered as a whole seemed to occur significantly more often with add-on stiripentol than with add-on placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have found no new studies since the last version of this review was published. Hence, we have made no changes to the conclusions of this update as presented in the initial review. We can draw no conclusions to support the use of stiripentol as add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Additional large, randomised, well-conducted trials are needed.
32875491	Fenfluramine for the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.	The last 50 years has seen the introduction of a great number of antiepileptic drugs, relieving the burden of seizures for many patients. However, some conditions remain a challenge for epileptologists, especially Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which are severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathies characterized by multiple seizure types and electroencephalographic abnormalities that are often unresponsive to combinations of antiepileptic drugs. The re-purposing of an old drug such as fenfluramine could provide an indispensable tool for clinicians, especially because only a few drugs have been tested in relatively homogeneous populations, like Dravet syndrome. It could also provide insights into precision medicine approaches to the treatment of epileptic syndromes. We searched for relevant papers within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Clinical Trial Database, considering publications through July 2020. Pre-clinical studies show a mechanism of action for fenfluramine that goes beyond its pro-serotoninergic activity and that is at the intersection of several pathways involved in excitation/inhibition balance. From the ongoing clinical trial data, it is evident that fenfluramine is proving to be a promising antiepileptic drug with very favorable pharmacokinetics and with a good overall safety profile when used at a lower dosage (0.2-0.7 mg/kg/day), despite its previously link to major cardiac adverse events that prompted its withdrawal from the market in 1997. Here, we review the experimental and clinical evidence of the efficacy of fenfluramine, including the latest results from ongoing clinical trials, and critically discuss the future potential of fenfluramine in terms of safety and precision medicine. Available data from the literature suggest a very good efficacy for both epileptic syndromes with a reduction in seizure burden and a longer seizure-free interval. We note the higher prevalence of evidence in patients with Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine has been used in association with both first- and second-line medications, while its use in monotherapy still needs to be assessed.
34053869	Genetics and gene therapy in Dravet syndrome.	"Dravet syndrome is a well-established electro-clinical condition first described in 1978. A main genetic cause was identified with the discovery of a loss-of-function SCN1A variant in 2001. Mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variations have subsequently been a main topic of research. Various genetic modifiers of clinical severities have been elucidated through many rigorous studies on genotype-phenotype correlations and the recent advances in next generation sequencing technology. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the regulation of gene expression and remarkable progress on genome-editing technology using the CRISPR-Cas9 system provide significant opportunities to overcome hurdles of gene therapy, such as enhancing NaV1.1 expression. This article reviews the current understanding of genetic pathology and the status of research toward the development of gene therapy for Dravet syndrome. This article is part of the Special Issue ""Severe Infantile Epilepsies""."
32422576	Barriers to transition from pediatric to adult care for patients with Dravet syndrome: A focus group study of caregivers.	"Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and epilepsy such as Dravet syndrome (DS) must navigate a complex web of state and community services through the transition from child-centered to adult-oriented healthcare. This study examined barriers to successful transition from the caregivers' perspective. Primary caregivers of teenagers or adults with DS who had contemplated or completed transition to adult care were eligible. A three-week, asynchronous, web-based focus group was conducted on Facebook. Data were analyzed in an iterative process based on a Grounded Theory approach. Participants reviewed findings for accuracy. Transition success was defined by how well it ensured adequate care for the child when caregivers became unable to provide it. Existing transition programs were described as ""not for our kids."" All caregivers reported that transition programs began too late. Challenges to identifying suitable providers were formidable, with 71% of adult patients still being seen by pediatric neurologists. Many adult physicians lacked a general knowledge of DS, yet caregivers perceived that adult physicians were unwilling to listen to caregivers, and few were comfortable accommodating patients with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors. Community programs often excluded patients with DS, and rural healthcare disparities created additional barriers. Analysis produced recommendations for improving the transition process including the creation of a certified Transition Navigator position in the clinical setting. The limitations of this focus group analysis include possible selection bias, but our study identified key issues and pathways to improve the transition process for patients with DS and their caregivers."
31862249	Fenfluramine hydrochloride for the treatment of seizures in Dravet syndrome: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a rare, treatment-resistant developmental epileptic encephalopathy characterised by multiple types of frequent, disabling seizures. Fenfluramine has been reported to have antiseizure activity in observational studies of photosensitive epilepsy and Dravet syndrome. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we enrolled children and young adults with Dravet syndrome. After a 6-week observation period to establish baseline monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF; convulsive seizures were defined as hemiclonic, tonic, clonic, tonic-atonic, generalised tonic-clonic, and focal with clearly observable motor signs), patients were randomly assigned through an interactive web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg per day, or fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg per day, added to existing antiepileptic agents for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the treatment period compared with baseline in the 0 7 mg/kg per day group versus placebo; 0 2 mg/kg per day versus placebo was assessed as a key secondary outcome. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with two identical protocols NCT02682927 and NCT02826863. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2016, and Aug 14, 2017, we assessed 173 patients, of whom 119 patients (mean age 9 0 years, 64 [54%] male) were randomly assigned to receive either fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg per day (39), fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg per day (40) or placebo (40). During treatment, the median reduction in seizure frequency was 74 9% in the fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg group (from median 20 7 seizures per 28 days to 4 7 seizures per 28 days), 42 3% in the fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg group (from median 17 5 seizures per 28 days to 12 6 per 28 days), and 19 2% in the placebo group (from median 27 3 per 28 days to 22 0 per 28 days). The study met its primary efficacy endpoint, with fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg per day showing a 62 3% greater reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 47 7-72 8, p<0 0001); fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg per day showed a 32 4% reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 6 2-52 3, p=0 0209). The most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of patients and more frequently in the fenfluramine groups) were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, fatigue, lethargy, somnolence, and decreased weight. Echocardiographic examinations revealed valve function within the normal physiological range in all patients during the trial and no signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension. INTERPRETATION: In Dravet syndrome, fenfluramine provided significantly greater reduction in convulsive seizure frequency compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated, with no observed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fenfluramine could be an important new treatment option for patients with Dravet syndrome. FUNDING: Zogenix.

32079034	Changing Landscape of Dravet Syndrome Management: An Overview.	Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.
