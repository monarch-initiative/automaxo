  Note that the provided text seems to be more of an opinion piece or editorial rather than a clinical article, and it does not provide detailed information about symptoms, chemicals, or specific medical actions beyond vaccination. The relationships are also somewhat inferred based on the context. 

  Also, as I'm providing information based on my training data up to January 2024, and this text seems to be related to a specific opinion or campaign about vaccination for Dravet Syndrome, my response might not reflect any developments or changes after that date. 

  Please verify any clinical information through reliable sources. Citations I provide might be fictional, as I don't have access to real-time data or databases.
