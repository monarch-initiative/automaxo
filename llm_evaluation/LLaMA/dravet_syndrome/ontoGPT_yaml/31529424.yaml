input_text: Accuracy of Flash Glucose Monitoring in a Patient with Dravet Syndrome
  on a Ketogenic Diet. We herein report the case of a 3-year-old girl with severe
  myoclonic epilepsy of infancy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) on a ketogenic diet
  (KD) whose glucose concentrations were controlled by using a flash glucose monitoring
  system. Two-hundred ninety-three events of moderate hypoglycemia with a minimum
  of 45 mg/dL, not related to day or night, were recorded during the observational
  period. Hypoglycemia rate declined from 24.5% of all measurements to 11.8% over
  time; one hypoglycemia-associated seizure and one seizure due to ketone concentrations
  below the therapeutic range were observed. In summary, this case report broadens
  our understanding of hypoglycemia risk in patients with DS on a KD. Especially in
  childhood, the painless and easy detection of low glucose concentrations might lead
  to improved cognitive performance, and the reduction of hypoglycemia-induced seizures.
