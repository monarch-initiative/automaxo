input_text: 'Efficacy, tolerability, and retention of fenfluramine for the treatment
  of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome: Compassionate use program in Germany.
  OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare but severe drug-resistant epilepsy. Before
  the approval of fenfluramine (FFA) for the treatment of seizures in DS, patients
  in Germany could receive treatment under a compassionate use program (CUP). METHODS:
  We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational study to describe the efficacy,
  tolerability, and retention of FFA within the CUP. Patients received add-on therapy
  with oral FFA gradually titrated to a target dose between .13 and .7 mg/kg/day.
  RESULTS: Overall, 78 patients with DS (median age = 8.0 years, range = 2.1-46.0;
  53% female, median concomitant antiseizure medications [ASMs] = 3) were treated
  with FFA for a median duration of 255.5 days (range = 31-572). Responder rates (a
  >=50% reduction; n = 78) and seizure-freedom rates at 3 months were 68% and 14%
  for total seizures, respectively, and 67% and 23% for generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
  Responder rates were consistent at 6 and 12 months (n = 66 and n = 43, respectively).
  Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 10.0 (range = .5-30)
  to 3.0 (range = 0-30) in the 3-month period before and after FFA treatment (p <
  .001). Significantly fewer patients reported at least one episode of status epilepticus
  (28% vs. 14% patients before and after FFA initiation, p = .005). During FFA treatment,
  35 (45%) patients were able to discontinue a concomitant ASM. At the last follow-up
  date, 66 (85%) patients remained on treatment with FFA. The most common adverse
  events were somnolence (36%), decreased appetite (22%), and ataxia (8%). Forty-eight
  (62%) patients were reported as having a meaningful global clinical improvement.
  SIGNIFICANCE: In a large cohort of patients, FFA demonstrated efficacy across a
  range of outcomes including clinically significant reductions in convulsive seizures,
  and was well tolerated, providing valuable information for real-world practice.'
