input_text: 'Vaccination and childhood epilepsies. INTRODUCTION: The evidence relating
  vaccination to febrile seizures and epilepsy is evaluated with an emphasis on febrile
  seizures (FS), Dravet syndrome (DS), West syndrome, and other developmental and
  epileptic encephalopathies. METHODS: A systematic literature review using search
  words vaccination/immunization AND febrile seizures/epilepsy/Dravet/epileptic encephalopathy/developmental
  encephalopathy was performed. The role of vaccination as the cause/trigger/aggravation
  factor for FS or epilepsies and preventive measures were analyzed. RESULTS: From
  1428 results, 846 duplicates and 447 irrelevant articles were eliminated; 120 were
  analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that vaccinations cause epilepsy in
  healthy populations. Vaccinations do not cause epileptic encephalopathies but may
  be non-specific triggers to seizures in underlying structural or genetic etiologies.
  The first seizure in DS may be earlier in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients,
  but developmental outcome is similar in both groups. Children with a personal or
  family history of FS or epilepsy should receive all routine vaccinations. This recommendation
  includes DS. The known risks of the infectious diseases prevented by immunization
  are well established. Vaccination should be deferred in case of acute illness. Acellular
  pertussis DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is recommended. The combination of
  certain vaccine types may increase the risk of febrile seizures however the public
  health benefit of separating immunizations has not been proven. Measles-containing
  vaccine should be administered at age 12-15 months. Routine prophylactic antipyretics
  are not indicated, as there is no evidence of decreased FS risk and they can attenuate
  the antibody response following vaccination. Prophylactic measures (preventive antipyretic
  medication) are recommended in DS due to the increased risk of prolonged seizures
  with fever.'

  Here are the extracted entities in the requested format:

  primary_disease: Epilepsy; Dravet syndrome; Febrile seizures

  medical_actions: Vaccination; immunization; administration of acellular pertussis DTaP; administration of measles-containing vaccine; prophylactic antipyretics; preventive antipyretic medication; deferment of vaccination in case of acute illness

  symptoms: Febrile seizures; epileptic encephalopathies; developmental and epileptic encephalopathies; prolonged seizures with fever

  chemicals: Acellular pertussis DTaP; measles-containing vaccine; antipyretics

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  Vaccination DOES NOT CAUSE epilepsy IN healthy populations; 
  Vaccination DOES NOT CAUSE epileptic encephalopathies IN healthy populations; 
  Vaccination MAY TRIGGER seizures IN underlying structural or genetic etiologies; 
  Acellular pertussis DTaP TREATS prevention of pertussis IN populations; 
  Measles-containing vaccine TREATS prevention of measles IN populations; 
  Prophylactic antipyretics DO NOT TREAT febrile seizures IN populations; 
  Preventive antipyretic medication TREATS prevention of prolonged seizures with fever IN Dravet syndrome; 
  Deferment of vaccination PREVENTS adverse reactions IN acute illness.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
