input_text: CRISPR/dCas9-based Scn1a gene activation in inhibitory neurons ameliorates
  epileptic and behavioral phenotypes of Dravet syndrome model mice. Dravet syndrome
  is a severe infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy which begins with febrile seizures
  and is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the voltage-gated sodium
  channel gene SCN1A. We designed a CRISPR-based gene therapy for Scn1a-haplodeficient
  mice using multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) in the promoter regions together with the
  nuclease-deficient Cas9 fused to transcription activators (dCas9-VPR) to trigger
  the transcription of SCN1A or Scn1a in vitro. We tested the effect of this strategy
  in vivo using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated system targeting inhibitory
  neurons and investigating febrile seizures and behavioral parameters. In both the
  human and mouse genes multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) in the upstream, rather than downstream,
  promoter region showed high and synergistic activities to increase the transcription
  of SCN1A or Scn1a in cultured cells. Intravenous injections of AAV particles containing
  the optimal combination of 4 gRNAs into transgenic mice with Scn1a-haplodeficiency
  and inhibitory neuron-specific expression of dCas9-VPR at four weeks of age increased
  Nav1.1 expression in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons, ameliorated their febrile
  seizures and improved their behavioral impairments. Although the usage of transgenic
  mice and rather modest improvements in seizures and abnormal behaviors hamper direct
  clinical application, our results indicate that the upregulation of Scn1a expression
  in the inhibitory neurons can significantly improve the phenotypes, even when applied
  after the juvenile stages. Our findings also suggest that the decrease in Nav1.1
  is directly involved in the symptoms seen in adults with Dravet syndrome and open
  a way to improve this condition.
