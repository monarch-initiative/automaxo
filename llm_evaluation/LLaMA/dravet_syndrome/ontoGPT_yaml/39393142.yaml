input_text: Neuromodulation strategies in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.
  Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset
  epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral
  impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory
  to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation
  treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation
  (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical
  regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific
  and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting
  key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures
  and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with
  centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest
  efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of
  DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated
  with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS
  and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding
  why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is
  most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses
  recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic
  brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the
  thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine
  thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize
  neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy,
  the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates
  consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests
  future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and
  biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic
  potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.
