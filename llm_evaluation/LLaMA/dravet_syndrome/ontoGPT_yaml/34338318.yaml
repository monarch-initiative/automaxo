input_text: 'Defining Dravet syndrome: An essential pre-requisite for precision medicine
  trials. OBJECTIVE: The classical description of Dravet syndrome, the prototypic
  developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, is of a normal 6-month-old infant presenting
  with a prolonged, febrile, hemiclonic seizure and showing developmental slowing
  after age 1 year. SCN1A pathogenic variants are found in >80% of patients. Many
  patients have atypical features resulting in diagnostic delay and inappropriate
  therapy. We aimed to provide an evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome
  in readiness for precision medicine trials. METHODS: Epilepsy patients were recruited
  to the University of Melbourne Epilepsy Genetics Research Program between 1995 and
  2020 by neurologists from around the world. Patients with SCN1A pathogenic variants
  were reviewed and only those with Dravet syndrome were included. Clinical data,
  including seizure and developmental course, were analyzed in all patients with SCN1A-Dravet
  syndrome. RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients were studied at a median age of
  8.5 years (range 10 months to 60 years); 25 were deceased. The median seizure-onset
  age was 5.7 months (range 1.5-20.6 months). Initial seizures were tonic-clonic (52%)
  and hemiclonic (35%), with only 55% being associated with fever. Only 34% of patients
  presented with status epilepticus (seizure lasting >=30 minutes). Median time between
  first and second seizure was 30 days (range 4 hours to 8 months), and seven patients
  (5%) had at least 6 months between initial seizures. Median ages at onset of second
  and third seizure types were 9.1 months (range 3 months-25.4 years) and 15.5 months
  (range 4 months-8.2 years), respectively. Developmental slowing occurred prior to
  12 months in 27%. SIGNIFICANCE: An evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome
  is essential for early diagnosis. We refine the spectrum of Dravet syndrome, based
  on patterns of seizure onset, type, and progression. Understanding of the full spectrum
  of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome presentation is essential for early diagnosis and optimization
  of treatment, especially as precision medicine trials become available.'
