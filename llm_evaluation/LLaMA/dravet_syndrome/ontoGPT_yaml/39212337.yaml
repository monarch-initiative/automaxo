input_text: 'Utilizing an acute hyperthermia-induced seizure test and pharmacokinetic
  studies to establish optimal dosing regimens in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome.
  OBJECTIVE: The current standard of care for Dravet syndrome (DS) includes polytherapy
  after inadequate seizure control with one or more monotherapy approaches. Treatment
  guidelines are often based on expert opinions, and finding an optimal balance between
  seizure control and adverse drug effects can be challenging. This study utilizes
  the efficacy and pharmacokinetic assessment of a second-line treatment regimen that
  combines clobazam and sodium valproate with an add-on drug as a proof-of-principle
  approach to establish an effective therapeutic regimen in a DS mouse model. METHODS:
  We evaluated the efficacy of add-on therapies stiripentol, cannabidiol, lorcaserin,
  or fenfluramine added to clobazam and sodium valproate against hyperthermia-induced
  seizures in Scn1aA1783V/WT mice. Clobazam, N-desmethyl clobazam (an active metabolite
  of clobazam), sodium valproate, stiripentol, and cannabidiol concentrations were
  quantified in plasma and brain using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
  for the combinations deemed effective against hyperthermia-induced seizures. The
  concentration data were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters via noncompartmental
  analysis in Phoenix WinNonLin. RESULTS: Higher doses of stiripentol or cannabidiol,
  in combination with clobazam and sodium valproate, were effective against hyperthermia-induced
  seizures in Scn1aA1783V/WT mice. In Scn1aWT/WT mice, brain clobazam and N-desmethyl
  clobazam concentrations were higher in the triple-drug combinations than in the
  clobazam monotherapy. Stiripentol and cannabidiol brain concentrations were greater
  in the triple-drug therapy than when given alone. SIGNIFICANCE: A polypharmacy strategy
  may be a practical preclinical approach to identifying efficacious compounds for
  DS. The drug-drug interactions between compounds used in this study may explain
  the potentiated efficacy of some polytherapies.'
