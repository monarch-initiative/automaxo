input_text: 'Abnormal brain gamma oscillations in response to auditory stimulation
  in Dravet syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of children with Dravet
  syndrome to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity in response to auditory steady-state
  stimulation. METHODS: Fifty-one subjects were included: 13 with Dravet syndrome
  with SCN1A gene alterations, 26 with non-Dravet epilepsies and 12 healthy controls.
  Responses to auditory steady-state stimulation elicited with a chirp-modulated tone
  between 1 and 120 Hz were collected in subjects and compared across groups. RESULTS:
  Subjects with Dravet syndrome showed weak or no responses in the 1-120 Hz frequency
  range. Healthy controls showed oscillatory responses following the frequency of
  the modulation that were maximal in the low (30-70 Hz) and high (80-120) gamma-ranges
  both, in the power and inter-trial coherence estimates. Non-Dravet epileptic children
  showed differences in the auditory responses when compared with the healthy controls
  but were able to generate oscillatory evoked activities following the frequency-varying
  stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to generate brain gamma-oscillatory activity
  of children with Dravet in response to a chirp-modulated auditory stimulus is highly
  impaired, is not due to epilepsy and is consistent with the Nav1.1 channel dysfunction
  affecting interneuron activity seen in Dravet mouse models. SIGNIFICANCE: The reported
  deficits in the brain oscillatory activity evoked by chirp modulated tones in children
  with Dravet is compatible with Dravet syndrome disease mechanisms and constitutes
  a potential biomarker for future disease-modifying interventions.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Dravet syndrome

  medical_actions: 

  symptoms: weak or no responses in the 1-120 Hz frequency range; abnormal brain gamma oscillations

  chemicals: 

  action_annotation_relationships: Dravet syndrome IS ASSOCIATED WITH weak or no responses in the 1-120 Hz frequency range; Dravet syndrome IS ASSOCIATED WITH abnormal brain gamma oscillations; Nav1.1 channel dysfunction CONTRIBUTES TO abnormal brain gamma oscillations IN Dravet syndrome 

  Note that there are no specific medical actions (e.g., treatments, therapies) mentioned in the text, which is why the medical_actions field is empty. The action_annotation_relationships field includes relationships between the disease, symptoms, and a potential underlying mechanism (Nav1.1 channel dysfunction).
