input_text: "Stiripentol add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. BACKGROUND:
  This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2014, and last
  updated in 2018. For nearly 30% of people with epilepsy, seizures are not controlled
  by current treatments. Stiripentol is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that was developed
  in France and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2007 for the
  treatment of Dravet syndrome as an adjunctive therapy with valproate and clobazam.
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol as add-on treatment
  for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are taking AEDs. SEARCH METHODS:
  For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 27 February 2020:
  Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web); and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 February 2020).
  CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from the Specialized
  Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy, Cochrane Central Register
  of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World
  Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We
  contacted Biocodex (the manufacturer of stiripentol) and epilepsy experts to identify
  published, unpublished and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, controlled,
  add-on trials of stiripentol in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. DATA
  COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion
  and extracted data. We investigated outcomes including 50% or greater reduction
  in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, adverse effects, treatment withdrawal and
  changes in quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of our selection criteria,
  we included no new studies in the present review update. We included only one study
  from the earlier review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study adopted a
  responder-enriched design and found no clear evidence of a reduction in seizure
  frequency (>= 50% seizure reduction) (risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval
  (CI) 0.81 to 2.82; low-certainty evidence) or evidence of seizure freedom (RR 1.18,
  95% CI 0.31 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) when add-on stiripentol was compared
  with placebo. Stiripentol led to a greater risk of adverse effects considered as
  a whole (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.47; low-certainty evidence). When we considered
  specific adverse events, confidence intervals were very wide and showed the possibility
  of substantial increases and small reductions in risks of neurological adverse effects
  (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.88 to 8.01; low-certainty evidence) and gastrointestinal adverse
  effects (RR 11.56, 95% CI 0.71 to 189.36; low-certainty evidence). Researchers noted
  no clear reduction in the risk of study withdrawal (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47;
  low-certainty evidence), which was high in both groups (35.0% in add-on placebo
  and 53.3% in stiripentol group; low-certainty evidence). The external validity of
  this study was limited because only responders to stiripentol (i.e. patients experiencing
  a >= 50% decrease in seizure frequency compared with baseline) were included in
  the randomised, add-on, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase. Furthermore, carry-over
  and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes related to seizure frequency.
  Very limited information derived from the only included study shows that adverse
  effects considered as a whole seemed to occur significantly more often with add-on
  stiripentol than with add-on placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have found no new
  studies since the last version of this review was published. Hence, we have made
  no changes to the conclusions of this update as presented in the initial review.
  We can draw no conclusions to support the use of stiripentol as add-on treatment
  for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Additional large, randomised, well-conducted
  trials are needed."
