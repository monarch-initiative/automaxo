input_text: "Clinical and Genetic Features of Dravet Syndrome: A Prime Example of
  the Role of Precision Medicine in Genetic Epilepsy. Dravet syndrome (DS), also known
  as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a rare and drug-resistant form of developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathies, which is both debilitating and challenging to manage,
  typically arising during the first year of life, with seizures often triggered by
  fever, infections, or vaccinations. It is characterized by frequent and prolonged
  seizures, developmental delays, and various other neurological and behavioral impairments.
  Most cases result from pathogenic mutations in the sodium voltage-gated channel
  alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene, which encodes a critical voltage-gated sodium channel
  subunit involved in neuronal excitability. Precision medicine offers significant
  potential for improving DS diagnosis and treatment. Early genetic testing enables
  timely and accurate diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of DS's underlying
  genetic mechanisms and neurobiology have enabled the development of targeted therapies,
  such as gene therapy, offering more effective and less invasive treatment options
  for patients with DS. Targeted and gene therapies provide hope for more effective
  and personalized treatments. However, research into novel approaches remains in
  its early stages, and their clinical application remains to be seen. This review
  addresses the current understanding of clinical DS features, genetic involvement
  in DS development, and outcomes of novel DS therapies."
