input_text: 'Changing Landscape of Dravet Syndrome Management: An Overview. Dravet
  syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe
  developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations
  in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased
  function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant
  seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus.
  Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early
  normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment,
  motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching
  gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet,
  and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy,
  only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative
  review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management
  of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP
  vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice,
  and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the
  approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel
  antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase
  3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing
  the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive
  impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment
  including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental
  stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium
  channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral
  vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death
  in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing
  and clinical validation of these devices.'
