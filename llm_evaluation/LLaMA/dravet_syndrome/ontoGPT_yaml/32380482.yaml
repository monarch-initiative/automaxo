input_text: 'Alteration in brain connectivity in patients with Dravet syndrome after
  vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): exploration of its effectiveness using graph theory
  analysis with electroencephalography. OBJECTIVE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is
  a nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients who have pharmaco-resistant Dravet
  syndrome (DS). Plentiful efforts have been made for delivering VNS to DS patients,
  but its effectiveness still requires further verification. We investigated the effectiveness
  of the VNS treatment of DS patients using brain connectivity analysis with electroencephalography
  (EEG). APPROACH: Twenty pharmaco-resistant DS patients were selected to undergo
  VNS implantation and classified into responder and non-responder groups after 24
  months post-VNS. The effect of VNS between 6 months pre- and 6, 12, and 24 months
  post-VNS in all patients, responders, and non-responders on four different frequency
  categories of four brain parameters were compared using resting-state EEG. MAIN
  RESULTS: In alpha and beta bands, all patients showed positive results for characteristic
  path length (CPL), global efficiency (GE), and transitivity after VNS treatment,
  and changes in betweenness centrality (BC) were not significant. The difference
  in transitivity between responders and non-responders is more pronounced than those
  in CPL and GE are, in both the alpha (p < 0.015) and beta (p < 0.001) bands. There
  was an obvious change in BC, especially in the alpha band, as the hubs tended to
  move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders; however, there was no change
  for the non-responders. SIGNIFICANCE: We investigated the alteration in brain connectivity
  of DS patients in alpha and beta bands during a long-term follow-up and found the
  responders have a decreased transitivity after the VNS treatment. Moreover, the
  hubs with high values in the alpha band tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal
  lobe for responders after VNS treatment.'
