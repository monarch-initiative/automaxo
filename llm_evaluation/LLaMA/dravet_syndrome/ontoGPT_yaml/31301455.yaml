input_text: 'Seizure management and prescription patterns of anticonvulsants in Dravet
  syndrome: A multicenter cohort study from Germany and review of literature. OBJECTIVE:
  The aim of this study was to describe the treatment pattern of patients with Dravet
  syndrome (DS) in Germany with routine antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and emergency medication,
  and to review the literature of real-world evidence on medicine utilization of patients
  with DS in Europe. METHODS: Patient use of routine AEDs and emergency medications
  over 3-6 months was analyzed from a 2018 multicenter survey of 93 caregivers of
  patients with DS throughout Germany. Results were contextualized in a review of
  real-world evidence on medicine utilization of patients with DS in Europe. RESULTS:
  The variety of medications and the most frequent combinations routinely used by
  patients with DS (AEDs and others) are described. Patients use a large number of
  pharmaceutical treatments to manage seizures. The five most commonly used AEDs were
  sodium valproate (66% of the patients; mean daily dose: 660 mg; 24.5 mg per kg bodyweight),
  bromide (44%; 1462 mg; 51.2 mg per kg), clobazam (41%; 10.4 mg; 0.32 mg per kg),
  stiripentol (35%; 797 mg; 27.6 mg per kg), and topiramate (24%; 107 mg; 3.5 mg per
  kg). Ninety percent had reported using emergency medications in the last 3 months;,
  with the most common medications being Buccolam (40%, an oromucosal form of midazolam)
  and diazepam (20%, mostly rectal application). No discernable relationships between
  current medication and age or seizure frequency were observed. SIGNIFICANCE: This
  is the first comprehensive report of routine AEDs and emergency medication use in
  a large sample of patients with DS in Germany over a period of 3-6 months and shows
  that despite the most common AED combinations being in line with clinical guidelines/best
  practice, there is no discernable impact of best treatment on seizure frequency.
  We find a higher use of bromide in Germany compared with other real-world evidence
  in Europe.'
