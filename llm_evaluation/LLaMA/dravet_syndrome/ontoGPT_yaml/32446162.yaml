input_text: Influence of stiripentol on perampanel serum levels. Stiripentol is an
  orphan drug successfully used in combination with valproate and clobazam in the
  treatment of Dravet syndrome. Perampanel has also been added by experts. In this
  retrospective study, we investigated the influence of stiripentol on perampanel
  serum levels by using the doses and corresponding perampanel serum levels of 10
  patients. The impact of stiripentol on the perampanel serum levels was significant
  as shown in a linear regression analysis, with perampanel serum levels increasing
  linearly with the stiripentol doses. We conclude that dose adjustments of stiripentol
  and perampanel when administered together, should be done carefully to avoid side
  effects or even severe intoxication. Hence, perampanel serum level monitoring seems
  advisable.
