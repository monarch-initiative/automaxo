input_text: 'The ketogenic diet for Dravet syndrome: A multicenter retrospective study.
  OBJECTIVE: The ketogenic diet (KD) is one of the main treatments for drug-resistant
  epilepsy. However, there have been few multicenter reports on the use of the KD
  for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS). The aim of this study was to analyze
  the efficacy and safety of this approach based on a large number of multicenter
  cases. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study from 14 centers
  in China. All patients were treated with the KD. We compared the effects of KD intervention
  time, age, and other factors. RESULTS: From March 2014 to March 2020, we treated
  114 patients with DS with the KD. The male-to-female ratio was 67:47. The KD median
  initiation age was 3 y and 4 mo, and the median number of antiseizure medications
  (ASMs) was 2.4. KD therapy was the first choice for three patients. Exactly 10.5%
  of the patients started KD therapy after failure of the first ASM therapy, with
  35.1% after failure of the second, 44.7% after the third, and 7% after the fourth
  or more. After KD therapy for 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo, the seizure-free rates were 14%,
  32.5%, 30.7%, and 19.3%, respectively; KD efficacy (>=50% reduction in seizure frequency)
  were 57.9%, 76.3%, 59.6%, and 43%, respectively; the retention rates were 97.4%,
  93%, 71.9%, and 46.5%, respectively; and the rates of adverse events were 25.2%,
  19.9%, 11%, and 5.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world, multicenter data analysis
  showed that the KD is effective for patients with DS and has a low incidence of
  side effects.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
