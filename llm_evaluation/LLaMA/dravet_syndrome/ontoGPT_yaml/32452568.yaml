input_text: Does cannabidiol have antiseizure activity independent of its interactions
  with clobazam? An appraisal of the evidence from randomized controlled trials. Four
  pivotal randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that adjunctive therapy
  with cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome
  (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Between 47% and 68% of patients allocated
  to CBD treatment in these trials were receiving clobazam (CLB), which shows complex
  interactions with CBD resulting, in particular, in a 3.4- to 5-fold increase in
  plasma concentration of the active metabolite norclobazam. This raises concern as
  to the role played by these interactions in determining the reduction in seizure
  frequency in CBD-treated patients, and the question of whether CBD per se has clinically
  evident antiseizure effects. We appraised available evidence on the clinical consequences
  of the CBD-CLB interaction, focusing on subgroup analyses of seizure outcomes in
  patients on and off CLB comedication in the pivotal CBD trials, as provided by the
  European Medicines Agency Public Assessment Report. Evaluation of the results of
  individual trials clearly showed that improvement in seizure control over placebo
  was greater when CBD was added on to CLB than when it was added on to other medications.
  However, seizure control was also improved in patients off CLB, and despite the
  small sample size the difference vs placebo was statistically significant for the
  10 mg/kg/d dose in one of the two LGS trials. Stronger evidence for an antiseizure
  effect of CBD independent of an interaction with CLB emerges from meta-analyses
  of seizure outcomes in the pooled population of LGS and DS patients not receiving
  CLB comedication. Although these results need to be interpreted taking into account
  methodological limitations, they provide the best clinical evidence to date that
  CBD exerts therapeutic effects in patients with epilepsy that are independent of
  its interaction with CLB. Greater antiseizure effects, and a greater burden of adverse
  effects, are observed when CBD is combined with CLB.
