input_text: 'Coadministered cannabidiol and clobazam: Preclinical evidence for both
  pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. OBJECTIVE: Cannabidiol (CBD) has
  been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat intractable
  childhood epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However,
  the intrinsic anticonvulsant activity of CBD has been questioned due to a pharmacokinetic
  interaction between CBD and a first-line medication, clobazam. This recognized interaction
  has led to speculation that the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD may simply reflect
  CBD augmenting clobazam exposure. The present study aimed to address the nature
  of the interaction between CBD and clobazam. METHODS: We examined whether CBD inhibits
  human CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam
  (N-CLB), respectively, and performed studies assessing the effects of CBD on brain
  and plasma pharmacokinetics of clobazam in mice. We then used the Scn1a+/- mouse
  model of Dravet syndrome to examine how CBD and clobazam interact. We compared anticonvulsant
  effects of CBD-clobazam combination therapy to monotherapy against thermally-induced
  seizures, spontaneous seizures and mortality in Scn1a+/- mice. In addition, we used
  Xenopus oocytes expressing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors to investigate
  the activity of GABAA receptors when treated with CBD and clobazam together. RESULTS:
  CBD potently inhibited CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of clobazam and CYP2C19 mediated
  metabolism of N-CLB. Combination CBD-clobazam treatment resulted in greater anticonvulsant
  efficacy in Scn1a+/- mice, but only when an anticonvulsant dose of CBD was used.
  It is important to note that a sub-anticonvulsant dose of CBD did not promote greater
  anticonvulsant effects despite increasing plasma clobazam concentrations. In addition,
  we delineated a novel pharmacodynamic mechanism where CBD and clobazam together
  enhanced inhibitory GABAA receptor activation. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights
  the involvement of both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between
  CBD and clobazam that may contribute to its efficacy in Dravet syndrome.'
