input_text: Heterozygous deletion of Gpr55 does not affect a hyperthermia-induced
  seizure, spontaneous seizures or survival in the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet
  syndrome. A purified preparation of cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis constituent, has
  been approved for the treatment of intractable childhood epilepsies such as Dravet
  syndrome. Extensive pharmacological characterization of CBD shows activity at numerous
  molecular targets but its anticonvulsant mechanism(s) of action is yet to be delineated.
  Many suggest that the anticonvulsant action of CBD is the result of G protein-coupled
  receptor 55 (GPR55) inhibition. Here we assessed whether Gpr55 contributes to the
  strain-dependent seizure phenotypes of the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome.
  The Scn1a+/- mice on a 129S6/SvEvTac (129) genetic background have no overt phenotype,
  while those on a [129 x C57BL/6J] F1 background exhibit a severe phenotype that
  includes hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and reduced survival.
  We observed greater Gpr55 transcript expression in the cortex and hippocampus of
  mice on the seizure-susceptible F1 background compared to those on the seizure-resistant
  129 genetic background, suggesting that Gpr55 might be a genetic modifier of Scn1a+/-
  mice. We examined the effect of heterozygous genetic deletion of Gpr55 and pharmacological
  inhibition of GPR55 on the seizure phenotypes of F1.Scn1a+/- mice. Heterozygous
  Gpr55 deletion and inhibition of GPR55 with CID2921524 did not affect the temperature
  threshold of a thermally-induced seizure in F1.Scn1a+/- mice. Neither was there
  an effect of heterozygous Gpr55 deletion observed on spontaneous seizure frequency
  or survival of F1.Scn1a+/- mice. Our results suggest that GPR55 antagonism may not
  be a suitable anticonvulsant target for Dravet syndrome drug development programs,
  although future research is needed to provide more definitive conclusions.
