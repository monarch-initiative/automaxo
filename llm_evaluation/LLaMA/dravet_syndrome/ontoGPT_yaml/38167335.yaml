input_text: 'Switching from zonisamide to perampanel improved the frequency of seizures
  caused by hyperthermia in Dravet syndrome: a case report. BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome
  is a severe epilepsy disorder characterized by drug-resistant seizures and cognitive
  dysfunction, often caused by SCN1A gene mutations. It leads to neurodevelopmental
  delays and motor, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, with a high mortality rate.
  Treatment options include sodium valproate, clobazam, and newer agents such as cannabidiol
  and fenfluramine. Zonisamide, which is used in some cases, can cause hyperthermia
  and oligohydrosis. Herein, we present a case of a patient with Dravet syndrome whose
  seizures were controlled by treating infections and switching from zonisamide to
  perampanel. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Japanese man with Dravet syndrome presented
  to our department with aspiration pneumonia. The patient had been treated with valproate,
  sodium bromide, and zonisamide for a long time. His seizures were triggered by hyperthermia.
  The patient was experiencing a sustained pattern of hyperthermia caused by infection,
  zonisamide, and persistent convulsions, which caused a vicious cycle of further
  seizures. In this case, the control of infection and switching from zonisamide to
  perampanel improved seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: Dravet syndrome usually begins
  with generalized clonic seizures in its infancy because of fever and progresses
  to various seizure types, often triggered by fever or seizure-induced heat due to
  mutations in the SCN1A gene that increases neuronal excitability. Seizures usually
  diminish with age, but the heat sensitivity remains. In this case, seizures were
  increased by repeated infections, and hyperthermia was induced by zonisamide, resulting
  in status epilepticus. Perampanel, an aminomethylphosphonic acid receptor antagonist,
  decreased seizures but caused psychiatric symptoms. It was effective in suppressing
  seizures of Dravet syndrome in this patient.'
