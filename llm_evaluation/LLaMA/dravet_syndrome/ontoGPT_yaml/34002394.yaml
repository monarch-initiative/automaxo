input_text: 'Development of an antiseizure drug screening platform for Dravet syndrome
  at the NINDS contract site for the Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program. OBJECTIVE:
  Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare but catastrophic genetic epilepsy, with 80% of patients
  carrying a mutation in the SCN1A gene. Currently, no antiseizure drug (ASD) exists
  that adequately controls seizures. In the clinic, individuals with DS often present
  first with a febrile seizure and, subsequently, generalized tonic-clonic seizures
  that can continue throughout life. To facilitate the development of ASDs for DS,
  the contract site of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
  (NINDS) Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP) has evaluated a mouse model of
  DS using the conditional knock-in Scn1aA1783V/WT mouse. METHODS: Survival rates
  and temperature thresholds for Scn1aA1783V/WT were determined. Prototype ASDs were
  administered via intraperitoneal injections at the time-to-peak effect, which was
  previously determined, prior to the induction of hyperthermia-induced seizures.
  ASDs were considered effective if they significantly increased the temperature at
  which Scn1aA1783V/WT mice had seizures. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of Scn1aA1783V/WT
  survive to adulthood and all have hyperthermia-induced seizures. The results suggest
  that hyperthermia-induced seizures in this model of DS are highly refractory to
  a battery of ASDs. Exceptions were clobazam, tiagabine, levetiracetam, and the combination
  of clobazam and valproic acid with add-on stiripentol, which elevated seizure thresholds.
  SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the data demonstrate that the proposed model for DS is suitable
  for screening novel compounds for the ability to block hyperthermia-induced seizures
  and that heterozygous mice can be evaluated repeatedly over the course of several
  weeks, allowing for higher throughput screening.'
