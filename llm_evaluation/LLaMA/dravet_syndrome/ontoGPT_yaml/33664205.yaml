input_text: 'Interictal autonomic dysfunction. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy is associated
  with autonomic dysfunction. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on measures of
  interictal autonomic function, focusing on heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex
  sensitivity (BRS) and electrodermal activity (EDA). RECENT FINDINGS: Resting HRV,
  BRS and EDA are altered in patients with epilepsy compared with healthy controls.
  A larger body of work is available for HRV compared with BRS and EDA, and points
  to interictal HRV derangements across a wide range of epilepsies, including focal,
  generalized, and combined generalized and focal epilepsies. HRV alterations are
  most pronounced in temporal lobe epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant and
  chronic epilepsies. There are conflicting data on the effect of antiseizure medications
  on measures of interictal autonomic function. However, carbamazepine has been associated
  with decreased HRV. Epilepsy surgery and vagus nerve stimulation do not appear to
  have substantial impact on measures of interictal autonomic function but well designed
  studies are lacking. SUMMARY: Patients with epilepsy, particularly those with longstanding
  uncontrolled seizures, have measurable alterations of resting autonomic function.
  These alterations may be relevant to the increased risk of premature mortality in
  epilepsy, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, which warrants investigation
  in future research.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Epilepsy

  medical_actions: Epilepsy surgery; vagus nerve stimulation; antiseizure medications; carbamazepine

  symptoms: Autonomic dysfunction; interictal autonomic function alterations; heart rate variability (HRV) derangements; decreased HRV; electrodermal activity (EDA) alterations; baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) alterations

  chemicals: Carbamazepine; antiseizure medications

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - Carbamazepine DECREASES HRV IN Epilepsy; 
  - Epilepsy surgery TREATS Epilepsy BUT HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON interictal autonomic function; 
  - Vagus nerve stimulation TREATS Epilepsy BUT HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON interictal autonomic function; 
  - Antiseizure medications TREAT Epilepsy BUT HAVE CONFLICTING EFFECTS ON interictal autonomic function; 
  - Epilepsy TREATS Epilepsy BUT IS ASSOCIATED WITH autonomic dysfunction; 
  - Temporal lobe epilepsy TREATS Epilepsy AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HRV alterations; 
  - Dravet syndrome TREATS Epilepsy AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HRV alterations; 
  - Drug-resistant epilepsies TREATS Epilepsy AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HRV alterations; 
  - Chronic epilepsies TREATS Epilepsy AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HRV alterations.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
