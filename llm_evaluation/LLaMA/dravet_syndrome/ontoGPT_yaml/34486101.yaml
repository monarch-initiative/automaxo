input_text: "Cannabidiol for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome:
  experts' recommendations for its use in clinical practice in Spain. INTRODUCTION:
  Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the main components of the cannabis plant that has demonstrated
  anti-epileptic seizure effect. Following its clinical development, in September
  2019 the European Medicines Agency approved its indication for the adjunctive therapy
  of epileptic seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome
  (DS), combined with clobazam (CLB), in patients of 2 years of age and older. AIM:
  To establish recommendations on the use of plant-derived highly purified CBD on
  which Spanish experts have reached consensus for the treatment of epilepsy in patients
  with DS and LGS based on their clinical experience and the scientific evidence.
  DEVELOPMENT: Consensus meeting with the participation of four Spanish neurologists
  and neuropediatric who are experts in epilepsy secondary to DS and LGS and with
  clinical experience in the use and management of CBD. They discussed on several
  topics, including posology (starting dose, dose escalation schema), efficacy (assessment
  of outcomes and indications for treatment withdrawal), and safety (evaluation, drug-drug
  interactions, adverse events management). CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimise CBD
  treatment, a slow dose escalation (= 4 weeks) is recommended until the maximum recommended
  dose or the desire effect is reached. It is also recommended that the concomitant
  antiseizure medications (ASMs) be reduced in case of adverse events due to interactions,
  and that the treatment continues for at least 6 months if it is well tolerated.
  The efficacy and safety of CBD must be assessed individually, considering the benefits
  and risks for individual patients."
