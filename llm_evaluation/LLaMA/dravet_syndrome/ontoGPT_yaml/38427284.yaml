input_text: 'Comparative efficacy and safety of stiripentol, cannabidiol and fenfluramine
  as first-line add-on therapies for seizures in Dravet syndrome: A network meta-analysis.
  OBJECTIVES: Stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol are licensed add-on therapies
  to treat seizures in Dravet Syndrome (DS). There are no direct or indirect comparisons
  assessing their full licensed dose regimens, across different jurisdictions, as
  first-line add-on therapies in DS. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and
  frequentist network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data
  for licensed add-on DS therapies. We compared the proportions of patients experiencing:
  reductions from baseline in monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF) of >=50%
  (clinically meaningful), >=75% (profound), and 100% (seizure-free); serious adverse
  events (SAEs); discontinuations due to AEs. RESULTS: We identified relevant data
  from two placebo-controlled RCTs for each drug. Stiripentol 50 mg/kg/day and fenfluramine
  0.7 mg/kg/day had similar efficacy in achieving >=50% (clinically meaningful) and
  >=75% (profound) reductions from baseline in MCSF (absolute risk difference [RD]
  for stiripentol versus fenfluramine 1% [95% confidence interval: -20% to 22%; p
  = 0.93] and 6% [-15% to 27%; p = 0.59], respectively), and both were statistically
  superior (p < 0.05) to licensed dose regimens of cannabidiol (10 or 20 mg/kg/day,
  with/irrespective of clobazam) for these outcomes. Stiripentol was statistically
  superior in achieving seizure-free intervals compared to fenfluramine (RD = 26%
  [CI: 8% to 44%; p < 0.01]) and licensed dose regimens of cannabidiol. There were
  no significant differences in the proportions of patients experiencing SAEs. The
  risk of discontinuations due to AEs was lower for stiripentol, although the stiripentol
  trials were shorter. SIGNIFICANCE: This NMA of RCT data indicates stiripentol, as
  a first-line add-on therapy in DS, is at least as effective as fenfluramine and
  both are more effective than cannabidiol in reducing convulsive seizures. No significant
  difference in the incidence of SAEs between the three add-on agents was observed,
  but stiripentol may have a lower risk of discontinuations due to AEs. These results
  may inform clinical decision-making and the continued development of guidelines
  for the treatment of people with DS. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study compared
  three drugs (stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol) used alongside other medications
  for managing seizures in a severe type of epilepsy called DS. The study found that
  stiripentol and fenfluramine were similarly effective in reducing seizures and both
  were more effective than cannabidiol. Stiripentol was the best drug for stopping
  seizures completely based on the available clinical trial data. All three drugs
  had similar rates of serious side effects, but stiripentol had a lower chance of
  being stopped due to side effects. This information can help guide treatment choices
  for people with DS.'
