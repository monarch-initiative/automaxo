input_text: "Dravet Syndrome: Novel Approaches for the Most Common Genetic Epilepsy.
  Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that
  is mainly associated with variants in SCN1A. While drug-resistant epilepsy is the
  most notable feature of this syndrome, numerous symptoms are present that have significant
  impact on patients' quality of life. In spite of novel, third-generation anti-seizure
  treatment options becoming available over the last several years, seizure freedom
  is often not attained and non-seizure symptoms remain. Precision medicine now offers
  realistic hope for seizure freedom in DS patients, with several approaches demonstrating
  preclinical success. Therapeutic approaches such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)
  and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered gene modulation have expanded the potential
  treatment options for DS, with some of these approaches now transitioning to clinical
  trials. Several of these treatments may risk the exacerbation of gain-of-function
  variants and may not be reversible, therefore emphasizing the need for functional
  testing of new pathogenic variants. The current absence of treatments that address
  the overall disease, in addition to seizures, exposes the urgent need for reliable,
  valid measures of the entire complement of symptoms as outcome measures to truly
  know the impact of treatments on DS. Additionally, with so many treatment options
  on the horizon, there will be a need to understand how to select appropriate patients
  for each treatment, whether treatments are complementary or adverse to each other,
  and long-term risks of the treatment. Nevertheless, precision therapeutics hold
  tremendous potential to provide long-lasting seizure freedom and even complete cures
  for this devastating disease."
