input_text: Genetics and gene therapy in Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a well-established
  electro-clinical condition first described in 1978. A main genetic cause was identified
  with the discovery of a loss-of-function SCN1A variant in 2001. Mechanisms underlying
  the phenotypic variations have subsequently been a main topic of research. Various
  genetic modifiers of clinical severities have been elucidated through many rigorous
  studies on genotype-phenotype correlations and the recent advances in next generation
  sequencing technology. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the regulation of
  gene expression and remarkable progress on genome-editing technology using the CRISPR-Cas9
  system provide significant opportunities to overcome hurdles of gene therapy, such
  as enhancing NaV1.1 expression. This article reviews the current understanding of
  genetic pathology and the status of research toward the development of gene therapy
  for Dravet syndrome. This article is part of the Special Issue "Severe Infantile
  Epilepsies".
