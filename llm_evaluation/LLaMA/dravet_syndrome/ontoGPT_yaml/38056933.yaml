input_text: Perioperative considerations for adult patients with Dravet syndrome in
  regional centres. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare and intractable severe form of
  epilepsy presenting in infancy with frequent prolonged myoclonic seizures and neurodevelopmental
  impairment, associated with a SCN1A gene mutation. Seizures are often triggered
  by temperature fluctuations and hyperthermia. This report presents a woman in her
  late adolescence with DS complicated with intractable catamenial epilepsy, a sex-specific
  form of epilepsy with seizure activity prominent during phases of the menstrual
  cycle. The patient underwent general anaesthesia for a hysteroscopy, cervical dilatation
  and endometrial curettage with Mirena insertion to improve seizure control. Her
  perioperative care was optimised for seizure prevention with continuation of antiepileptic
  medications, strict temperature monitoring and control, optimised anaesthetic agents
  encompassing induction with propofol and fentanyl with maintenance sevoflurane,
  followed by attentive postoperative care and monitoring. This case demonstrates
  that general anaesthesia can safely be delivered to adult patients with DS in rural
  and regional areas with thorough perioperative planning.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
