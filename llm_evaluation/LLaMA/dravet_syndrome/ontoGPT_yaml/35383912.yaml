input_text: "COVID-19 vaccine in patients with Dravet syndrome: Observations and real-world
  experiences. OBJECTIVE: Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a primary tool
  to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, vaccination is a common seizure trigger
  in individuals with Dravet syndrome (DS). Information surrounding COVID-19 vaccine
  side effects in patients with DS would aid caregivers and providers in decisions
  for and management of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A survey was emailed to the
  Dravet Syndrome Foundation's Family Network and posted to the Dravet Parent & Caregiver
  Support Group on Facebook between May and August 2021. Deidentified information
  obtained included demographics and vaccination status for individuals with DS. Vaccine
  type, side effects, preventative measures, and changes in seizure activity following
  COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. For unvaccinated individuals, caregivers were
  asked about intent to vaccinate and reasons for their decision. RESULTS: Of 278
  survey responses, 120 represented vaccinated individuals with DS (median age = 19.5
  years), with 50% reporting no side effects from COVID-19 vaccination. Increased
  seizures following COVID-19 vaccination were reported in 16 individuals, but none
  had status epilepticus. Of the 158 individuals who had not received a COVID-19 vaccination,
  37 were older than 12 years (i.e., eligible at time of study), and only six of these
  caregivers indicated intent to seek vaccination. The remaining 121 responses were
  caregivers to children younger than 12 years, 60 of whom indicated they would not
  seek COVID-19 vaccination when their child with DS became eligible. Reasons for
  vaccine hesitancy were fear of increased seizure activity and concerns about vaccine
  safety. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate COVID-19 vaccination is well tolerated
  by individuals with DS. One main reason for vaccine hesitancy was fear of increased
  seizure activity, which occurred in only 13% of vaccinated individuals, and none
  had status epilepticus. This study provides critical and reassuring insights for
  caregivers and health care providers making decisions about the safety of COVID-19
  vaccinations for individuals with DS."
