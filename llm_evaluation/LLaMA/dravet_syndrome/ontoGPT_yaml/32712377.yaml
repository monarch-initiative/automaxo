input_text: 'Efficacy of the ketogenic diet in patients with Dravet syndrome: A meta-analysis.
  PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is an infantile epilepsy syndrome with drug resistant seizures
  and cognitive impairment. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the findings
  of relevant published studies to identify the efficacy of a ketogenic diet in patients
  with Dravet syndrome and their compliance thereof, and to provide useful information
  for clinical practice. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and CNKI databases
  were searched for relevant studies published up to September 25, 2019; the included
  studies were reviewed. Meta-analyses were performed using R software to determine
  the combined efficacy rates and retention rate for the ketogenic diet in patients
  with Dravet syndrome. RESULTS: Seven studies involving 167 patients met the inclusion
  criteria: four were retrospective studies, and three were prospective studies. The
  meta-analysis revealed that 63 %, 60 %, and 47 % of responder patients achieved
  >=50 % seizure reduction at month 3, 6, and 12, respectively. The pooled retention
  rate of the ketogenic diet at month 6 and month 12 was 78 % and 49 %, respectively.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that the ketogenic diet is a treatment
  option for patients with Dravet syndrome. The ketogenic diet is safe and its adverse
  effects are mostly acceptable. However, further investigations, especially high-quality
  controlled trials with large samples, are required.'
