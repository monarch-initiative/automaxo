input_text: 'Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) offers
  an alternative strategy to prevent children from being born with hereditary neurological
  diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes: a retrospective
  study. BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M)
  is now widely used as an effective strategy to prevent various monogenic or chromosomal
  diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, couples with a family
  history of hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous
  system phenotypes and/or carrying the pathogenic genes underwent PGT-M to prevent
  children from inheriting disease-causing gene mutations from their parents and developing
  known genetic diseases. After PGT-M, unaffected (i.e., normal) embryos after genetic
  detection were transferred into the uterus of their corresponding mothers. RESULTS:
  A total of 43 carrier couples with the following hereditary neurological diseases
  or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes underwent PGT-M: Duchenne
  muscular dystrophy (13 families); methylmalonic acidemia (7 families); spinal muscular
  atrophy (5 families); infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and intellectual developmental
  disorder (3 families each); Cockayne syndrome (2 families); Menkes disease, spinocerebellar
  ataxia, glycine encephalopathy with epilepsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, mucopolysaccharidosis,
  Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis, and Dravet syndrome (1 family each). After 53 PGT-M cycles, the final
  transferable embryo rate was 12.45%, the clinical pregnancy rate was 74.19%, and
  the live birth rate was 89.47%; a total of 18 unaffected (i.e., healthy) children
  were born to these families. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of
  PGT-M in preventing children born with hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic
  diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes.'

  medical_actions: Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M); Genetic detection; Embryo transfer

  symptoms: None explicitly mentioned, but the following can be inferred as symptoms or manifestations of the diseases: muscular dystrophy; acidemia; spinal muscular atrophy; neuroaxonal dystrophy; intellectual developmental disorder; Cockayne syndrome; Menkes disease; spinocerebellar ataxia; glycine encephalopathy with epilepsy; Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; mucopolysaccharidosis; Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; adrenoleukodystrophy; phenylketonuria; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Dravet syndrome

  chemicals: None explicitly mentioned

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  PGT-M PREVENTS hereditary neurological diseases IN couples with family history; 
  PGT-M PREVENTS metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes IN couples with family history; 
  PGT-M TREATS genetic diseases IN embryos; 
  genetic detection TREATS disease-causing gene mutations IN embryos; 
  embryo transfer TREATS unaffected embryos IN mothers. 

  Note that the relationships are not exhaustive, and some relationships can be inferred but not explicitly stated. Also, keep in mind that I don't have access to a database or search engine to verify the accuracy of the extracted information.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
