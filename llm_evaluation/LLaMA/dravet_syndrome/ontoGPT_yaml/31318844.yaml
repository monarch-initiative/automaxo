input_text: 'Impact of CYP2C19 Phenotypes on Clinical Efficacy of Stiripentol in Japanese
  Patients With Dravet Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Stiripentol is a strong inhibitor of
  CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. This study compared the effect of stiripentol on the pharmacokinetics
  of clobazam and N-desmethyl-clobazam (NCLB; an active metabolite of clobazam) between
  different CYP2C19 phenotypes. We also evaluated the clinical impact of CYP2C19 phenotypes
  in Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome receiving a combination of valproic acid,
  clobazam, and stiripentol. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 241 blood samples
  from 64 patients (aged 1-40 years) and calculated the concentration/dose (CD) ratio
  [serum level (ng/mL) divided by dose (mg/kg)] for clobazam and NCLB. Based on their
  CYP2C19 genotypes, patients were classified as extensive metabolizers (EM group:
  CYP2C19*1/*1, *1/*2, or *1/*3) or poor metabolizers (PM group: CYP2C19*2/*2, *3/*3,
  or *2/*3). We also reviewed the clinical records of 56 patients who commenced stiripentol
  therapy and calculated the retention rate for stiripentol therapy over an observation
  period of 208 weeks. RESULTS: Concomitant administration of stiripentol led to a
  marked increase in the CD ratio of clobazam (1.8-fold in the EM group and 1.5-fold
  in the PM group). In addition, stiripentol increased the CD ratio of NCLB by 6.6-fold
  in the EM group, but decreased it by 0.7-fold in the PM group. The estimated retention
  rate with stiripentol therapy was higher, and the duration of retention was longer
  in the EM group than in the PM group (1378 versus 933 days, P < 0.001). In patients
  with the PM phenotype, the adjusted hazard ratio for ceasing stiripentol therapy
  was 6.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-24.7, P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The effect
  of stiripentol on the pharmacokinetics of NCLB was significantly different between
  patients with the EM and PM phenotypes, which could influence the clinical response
  of Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome receiving the combination of valproic
  acid, clobazam, and stiripentol.'
