input_text: 'Fenfluramine hydrochloride for the treatment of seizures in Dravet syndrome:
  a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome
  is a rare, treatment-resistant developmental epileptic encephalopathy characterised
  by multiple types of frequent, disabling seizures. Fenfluramine has been reported
  to have antiseizure activity in observational studies of photosensitive epilepsy
  and Dravet syndrome. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and
  safety of fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. METHODS: In this randomised,
  double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we enrolled children and young
  adults with Dravet syndrome. After a 6-week observation period to establish baseline
  monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF; convulsive seizures were defined as
  hemiclonic, tonic, clonic, tonic-atonic, generalised tonic-clonic, and focal with
  clearly observable motor signs), patients were randomly assigned through an interactive
  web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg per day,
  or fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg per day, added to existing antiepileptic agents for 14
  weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean monthly frequency of convulsive
  seizures during the treatment period compared with baseline in the 0 7 mg/kg per
  day group versus placebo; 0 2 mg/kg per day versus placebo was assessed as a key
  secondary outcome. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses
  included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This
  trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with two identical protocols NCT02682927
  and NCT02826863. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2016, and Aug 14, 2017, we assessed 173
  patients, of whom 119 patients (mean age 9 0 years, 64 [54%] male) were randomly
  assigned to receive either fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg per day (39), fenfluramine 0 7
  mg/kg per day (40) or placebo (40). During treatment, the median reduction in seizure
  frequency was 74 9% in the fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg group (from median 20 7 seizures
  per 28 days to 4 7 seizures per 28 days), 42 3% in the fenfluramine 0 2 mg/kg group
  (from median 17 5 seizures per 28 days to 12 6 per 28 days), and 19 2% in the placebo
  group (from median 27 3 per 28 days to 22 0 per 28 days). The study met its primary
  efficacy endpoint, with fenfluramine 0 7 mg/kg per day showing a 62 3% greater reduction
  in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 47 7-72 8, p<0 0001); fenfluramine 0
  2 mg/kg per day showed a 32 4% reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95%
  CI 6 2-52 3, p=0 0209). The most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10%
  of patients and more frequently in the fenfluramine groups) were decreased appetite,
  diarrhoea, fatigue, lethargy, somnolence, and decreased weight. Echocardiographic
  examinations revealed valve function within the normal physiological range in all
  patients during the trial and no signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension. INTERPRETATION:
  In Dravet syndrome, fenfluramine provided significantly greater reduction in convulsive
  seizure frequency compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated, with no
  observed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fenfluramine
  could be an important new treatment option for patients with Dravet syndrome. FUNDING:
