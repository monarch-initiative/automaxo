input_text: 'CRISPR/dCas9 as a Therapeutic Approach for Neurodevelopmental Disorders:
  Innovations and Limitations Compared to Traditional Strategies. Brain development
  is a complex process that requires a series of precise and coordinated events to
  take place. When alterations in some of those events occur, neurodevelopmental disorders
  (NDDs) may appear, with their characteristic symptoms, including cognitive, social
  motor deficits, and epilepsy. While pharmacologic treatments have been the only
  therapeutic options for many years, more recently the research is turning to the
  direct removal of the underlying genetic cause of each specific NDD. This is possible
  thanks to the increased knowledge of genetic basis of those diseases and the enormous
  advances in genome-editing tools. Together with clustered regularly interspaced
  short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based strategies, there is a great development
  also of nuclease defective Cas9 (dCas9) tools that, with an extreme flexibility,
  allow the recruitment of specific protein functions to the desired genomic sites.
  In this work, we review dCas9-based tools and discuss all the published applications
  in the setting of therapeutic approaches for NDDs at the preclinical level. In particular,
  dCas9-based therapeutic strategies for Dravet syndrome, transcallosal dysconnectivity
  caused by mutations in C11orf46 gene, and Fragile X syndrome are presented and discussed.
  A direct comparison with other possible therapeutic strategies, such as classic
  gene replacement or CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies, is provided. We also highlight
  not only those aspects that constitute a clear advantage compared to previous strategies
  but also the main technical hurdles related to their applications that need to be
  overcome.'
