input_text: Pharmacological management of prolonged seizures in Dravet syndrome including
  intravenous phenytoin. Dravet syndrome (DS) is an infantile onset developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathy. Sodium channel blockers are known to exacerbate seizures
  in this syndrome. Due to its high incidence, the management of prolonged seizures
  is crucial for DS patients. There is still ambiguity regarding the use of intravenous
  phenytoin for prolonged seizure in DS patients mainly due to the lack of data, raising
  concern about the safety of it use. We conducted a retrospective study (from January
  2009 to January 2020) aiming to assess the management of prolonged seizures in DS
  with a focus on the use of intravenous phenytoin. Data were collected for patients
  admitted to our hospital for seizures lasting >5 min. Among 52 identified patients
  in our database, 23 experienced 59 prolonged seizures managed in our hospital. Only
  four seizures ceased without rescue medication. Notably, the use of intravenous
  phenytoin was not associated with discernible adverse effects and was effective
  in stopping status epilepticus in 71% of cases. This study suggests the safety and
  efficacy of intravenous phenytoin for prolonged seizure in DS. There is a need for
  broader investigations of emergency treatments for evidence-based recommendations
  for the emergency plan of each patient.
