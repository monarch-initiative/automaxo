input_text: Transcranial static magnetic stimulation reduces seizures in a mouse model
  of Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of severe genetic epilepsy characterized
  by recurrent and long-lasting seizures. It appears around the first year of life,
  with a quick evolution toward an increase in the frequency of the seizures, accompanied
  by a delay in motor and cognitive development, and does not respond well to antiepileptic
  medication. Most patients carry a mutation in the gene SCN1A encoding the alpha
  subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, resulting in hyperexcitability
  of neural circuits and seizure onset. In this work, we applied transcranial static
  magnetic stimulation (tSMS), a non-invasive, safe, easy-to-use and affordable neuromodulatory
  tool that reduces neural excitability in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome. We demonstrate
  that tSMS dramatically reduced the number of crises. Furthermore, crises recorded
  in the presence of the tSMS were shorter and less intense than in the sham condition.
  Since tSMS has demonstrated its efficacy at reducing cortical excitability in humans
  without showing unwanted side effects, in an attempt to anticipate a possible use
  of tSMS for Dravet Syndrome patients, we performed a numerical simulation in which
  the magnetic field generated by the magnet was modeled to estimate the magnetic
  field intensity reached in the cerebral cortex, which could help to design stimulation
  strategies in these patients. Our results provide a proof of concept for nonpharmacological
  treatment of Dravet syndrome, which opens the door to the design of new protocols
  for treatment.
