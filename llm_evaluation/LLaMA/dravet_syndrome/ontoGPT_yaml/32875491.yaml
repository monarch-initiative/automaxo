input_text: Fenfluramine for the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.
  The last 50 years has seen the introduction of a great number of antiepileptic drugs,
  relieving the burden of seizures for many patients. However, some conditions remain
  a challenge for epileptologists, especially Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
  which are severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathies characterized by multiple
  seizure types and electroencephalographic abnormalities that are often unresponsive
  to combinations of antiepileptic drugs. The re-purposing of an old drug such as
  fenfluramine could provide an indispensable tool for clinicians, especially because
  only a few drugs have been tested in relatively homogeneous populations, like Dravet
  syndrome. It could also provide insights into precision medicine approaches to the
  treatment of epileptic syndromes. We searched for relevant papers within MEDLINE,
  EMBASE, and the Clinical Trial Database, considering publications through July 2020.
  Pre-clinical studies show a mechanism of action for fenfluramine that goes beyond
  its pro-serotoninergic activity and that is at the intersection of several pathways
  involved in excitation/inhibition balance. From the ongoing clinical trial data,
  it is evident that fenfluramine is proving to be a promising antiepileptic drug
  with very favorable pharmacokinetics and with a good overall safety profile when
  used at a lower dosage (0.2-0.7 mg/kg/day), despite its previously link to major
  cardiac adverse events that prompted its withdrawal from the market in 1997. Here,
  we review the experimental and clinical evidence of the efficacy of fenfluramine,
  including the latest results from ongoing clinical trials, and critically discuss
  the future potential of fenfluramine in terms of safety and precision medicine.
  Available data from the literature suggest a very good efficacy for both epileptic
  syndromes with a reduction in seizure burden and a longer seizure-free interval.
  We note the higher prevalence of evidence in patients with Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine
  has been used in association with both first- and second-line medications, while
  its use in monotherapy still needs to be assessed.
