input_text: 'A Practical Guide to the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome with Anti-Seizure
  Medication. Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
  characterised by refractory seizures and cognitive dysfunction. The treatment is
  challenging, not least because the seizures are highly drug resistant, requiring
  multiple anti-seizure medications (ASMs), while some ASMs can exacerbate seizures.
  Initial treatments include the broad-spectrum ASMs valproate (VPA), and clobazam
  (CLB) in some regions; however, they are generally insufficient to control seizures.
  With this in mind, three adjunct ASMs have been approved specifically for the treatment
  of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome: stiripentol (STP) in 2007 in the European
  Union and 2018 in the USA, cannabidiol (CBD) in 2018/2019 (in combination with CLB
  in the European Union) and fenfluramine (FFA) in 2020. These "add-on" therapies
  (mostly to VPA/CLB) are used as escalation therapies, with the choice dependent
  on availability in different countries, patient characteristics and caregiver preferences.
  Topiramate is also frequently used, with evidence of efficacy in Dravet syndrome,
  and there is anecdotal evidence of efficacy with bromide, which is frequently used
  in Germany and Japan. With a growing treatment landscape for Dravet syndrome, there
  can be practical challenges for clinicians, particularly with issues associated
  with polypharmacy. This practical guide provides an overview of these main ASMs
  including their indications/contraindications, mechanism of action, efficacy, safety
  and tolerability profile, dosage requirements, and laboratory and clinical parameters
  to be evaluated. Standard laboratory and clinical parameters include blood counts,
  liver function tests, serum concentrations of ASMs, monitoring the growth of children,
  as well as weight loss and acceleration of behavioural problems. Regular cardiac
  monitoring is also important with FFA as it has previously been associated with
  cases of cardiac valve disease when used in adults at high doses (up to 120 mg/day)
  in combination with phentermine as a therapy for obesity. Importantly, no signs
  of heart valve disease have been documented to date at the low doses used in patients
  with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. In addition, potential drug-drug
  interactions and their consequences are a key consideration in everyday practice.
  Interactions that potentially require dosage adjustments to alleviate adverse events
  include the following: STP + CLB resulting in increased plasma concentrations of
  CLB and its active metabolite norclobazam may increase somnolence, and an interaction
  with STP and VPA may increase gastrointestinal adverse events. Cannabidiol has a
  bi-directional interaction with CLB producing an increase in plasma concentrations
  of 7-OH-CBD and norclobazam resulting in the potential for increased somnolence
  and sedation. In addition, CBD is associated with elevations of liver transaminases
  particularly in patients taking concomitant VPA. The interaction between FFA and
  STP requires a dose reduction of FFA. Furthermore, concomitant administration of
  VPA with topiramate has been associated with encephalopathy and/or hyperammonaemia.
  Finally, we briefly describe other ASMs used in Dravet syndrome, and current key
  clinical trials.'
