input_text: 'Seizures following vaccination in children: Risks, outcomes and management
  of subsequent revaccination. BACKGROUND: Seizures and status epilepticus can occur
  within 14 days following administration of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines.
  These vaccine-proximate seizures can undermine parental confidence in vaccine safety
  and affect further vaccination decisions. Vaccine-proximate status epilepticus (VP-SE)
  is uncommon but may be the first manifestation of genetic developmental epileptic
  encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article
  is to review current literature on the risks and outcomes of vaccine-proximate seizures
  and, using two clinical scenarios, outline management of subsequent revaccination.
  DISCUSSION: Vaccine-proximate seizures require careful evaluation of the vaccine(s)
  involved, seizure type and duration to determine a safe course for revaccination.
  Vaccine-proximate febrile seizures (VP-FSs) have similar outcomes to other febrile
  seizures and are not associated with increased developmental or behavioural concerns.
  Vaccination for children with VP-FSs can occur safely in the community. However,
  VP-SE cases warrant prompt specialist review, consideration of genetic epilepsy
  testing and referral to a specialist immunisation clinic for subsequent vaccination
  under medical supervision.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
