input_text: "Therapeutic hypothermia for pediatric refractory status epilepticus May
  Ameliorate post-status epilepticus epilepsy. BACKGROUND: To compare the clinical
  characteristics and outcomes of pediatric patients with refractory status epilepticus
  (RSE) and super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) who received therapeutic hypothermia
  (TH) plus anticonvulsants or anticonvulsants alone. METHODS: Two-medical referral
  centers, retrospective cohort study. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Taoyuan
  Chang Gung Children's hospital and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We reviewed
  the medical records of 23 patients with RSE/SRSE who were admitted to PICU from
  January 2014 to December 2017. Of these, 11 patients received TH (TH group) and
  12 patients did not (control group). RESULTS: The selective endpoints were RSE/SRSE
  duration, length of PICU stay, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. We applied
  TH using the Artic Sun  temperature management system (target temperature, 34-35\
  \  C; duration, 48-72 h). Of the 11 patients who received TH, 7 had febrile infection-related
  epilepsy syndrome (FIRSE), one had Dravet syndrome, and three had traumatic brain
  injury. The TH group had significantly shortern seizure durations than did the control
  group (hrs; median (IQR) 24(40) vs. 96(90), p < 0.05). Two patients in the TH group
  died of pulmonary embolism and extreme brain edema. The length of PICU stay was
  similar between the groups (days; median (IQR) 30(42) v.s 30.5(30.25)). The TH group
  had significantly better long-term outcomes than did the control group (GOS score,
  median (IQR) 4(2) v.s 3 (0.75), p = 0.01*). The TH group had a significantly lower
  incidence of later chronic refractory epilepsy than did the control group (TH v.s
  non-TH, 5/11 (45%) v.s. 12/12(100%), p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TH effectively reduced
  the seizure burden in patients with RSE/SRSE. Our findings support that for patients
  with RSE/SRSE, TH shortens the seizure duration, ultimately reducing the occurrence
  of post-status epilepticus epilepsy and improving patients' long-term survival."
