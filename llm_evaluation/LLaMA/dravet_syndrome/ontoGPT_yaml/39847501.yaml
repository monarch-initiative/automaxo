input_text: Neonatal but not Juvenile Gene Therapy Reduces Seizures and Prolongs Lifespan
  in SCN1B-Dravet Syndrome Mice. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic
  encephalopathy (DEE) that begins in the first year of life. While most cases of
  DS are caused by variants in SCN1A, variants in SCN1B, encoding voltage-gated sodium
  channel beta1 subunits, are also linked to DS or to the more severe early infantile
  DEE. Both disorders fall under the OMIM term DEE52. Scn1b null mice model DEE52,
  with spontaneous generalized seizures and death in 100% of animals in the third
  postnatal week. Scn1b null cortical parvalbumin-positive interneurons and pyramidal
  neurons are hypoexcitable. The goal of this study was to develop a proof-of-principle
  gene replacement strategy for DEE52. We tested an adeno-associated viral vector
  encoding beta1 subunit cDNA (AAV-Navbeta1) in Scn1b null mice. We demonstrated that
  AAV-Navbeta1 drives beta1 protein expression in excitatory and inhibitory neurons
  in mouse brain. Bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of AAV-Navbeta1
  in Scn1b null mice at postnatal day (P) 2, but not at P10, reduced spontaneous seizure
  severity and duration, prolonged life span, prevented hyperthermia-induced seizures,
  and restored cortical neuron excitability. AAV-Navbeta1 administration to WT mice
  resulted in beta1 overexpression in brain but no obvious adverse effects. This work
  lays the foundation for future development of a gene therapeutic strategy for SCN1B-linked
  DEE patients. .
