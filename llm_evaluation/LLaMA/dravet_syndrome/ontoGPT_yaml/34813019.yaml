input_text: CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Gene Therapy in Neurological Disorders. Neurological
  disorders are primarily diseases with sophisticated etiology that are always refractory
  and recrudescent. The major obstruction to effective therapies for neurological
  disorders is the poor understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas9
  technology, which allows precise and effective gene editing in almost any cell type
  and organism, is accelerating the pace of basic biological research. An increasing
  number of groups are focusing on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of neurological
  disorders and developing novel therapies using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This review
  highlights the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the treatment of neurological
  disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal
  dementia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Dravet syndrome, epilepsy, Huntington's disease,
  and Parkinson's disease. Hopefully, it will improve our understanding of neurological
  disorders and give insights into future treatments for neurological disorders.
