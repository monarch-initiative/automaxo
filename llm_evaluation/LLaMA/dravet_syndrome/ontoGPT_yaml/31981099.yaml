input_text: From Genetic Testing to Precision Medicine in Epilepsy. Epilepsy includes
  a number of medical conditions with recurrent seizures as common denominator. The
  large number of different syndromes and seizure types as well as the highly variable
  inter-individual response to the therapies makes management of this condition often
  challenging. In the last two decades, a genetic etiology has been revealed in more
  than half of all epilepsies and single gene defects in ion channels or neurotransmitter
  receptors have been associated with most inherited forms of epilepsy, including
  some focal and lesional forms as well as specific epileptic developmental encephalopathies.
  Several genetic tests are now available, including targeted assays up to revolutionary
  tools that have made sequencing of all coding (whole exome) and non-coding (whole
  genome) regions of the human genome possible. These recent technological advances
  have also driven genetic discovery in epilepsy and increased our understanding of
  the molecular mechanisms of many epileptic disorders, eventually providing targets
  for precision medicine in some syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome, pyroxidine-dependent
  epilepsy, and glucose transporter 1 deficiency. However, these examples represent
  a relatively small subset of all types of epilepsy, and to date, precision medicine
  in epilepsy has primarily focused on seizure control, and other clinical aspects,
  such as neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, have yet been possible
  to address. We herein summarize the most recent advances in genetic testing and
  provide up-to-date approaches for the choice of the correct test for some epileptic
  disorders and tailored treatments that are already applicable in some monogenic
  epilepsies. In the next years, the most probably scenario is that epilepsy treatment
  will be very different from the currently almost empirical approach, eventually
  with a "precision medicine" approach applicable on a large scale.
