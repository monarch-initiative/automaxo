                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) that begins in the first year of life. While most cases of DS are caused by variants in SCN1A, variants in SCN1B, encoding voltage-gated sodium channel beta1 subunits, are also linked to DS or to the more severe early infantile DEE. Both disorders fall under the OMIM term DEE52. Scn1b null mice model DEE52, with spontaneous generalized seizures and death in 100% of animals in the third postnatal week. Scn1b null cortical parvalbumin-positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons are hypoexcitable. The goal of this study was to develop a proof-of-principle gene replacement strategy for DEE52. We tested an adeno-associated viral vector encoding beta1 subunit cDNA (AAV-Navbeta1) in Scn1b null mice. We demonstrated that AAV-Navbeta1 drives beta1 protein expression in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mouse brain. Bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of AAV-Navbeta1 in Scn1b null mice at postnatal day (P) 2, but not at P10, reduced spontaneous seizure severity and duration, prolonged life span, prevented hyperthermia-induced seizures, and restored cortical neuron excitability. AAV-Navbeta1 administration to WT mice resulted in beta1 overexpression in brain but no obvious adverse effects. This work lays the foundation for future development of a gene therapeutic strategy for SCN1B-linked DEE patients. .",

                    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa produces a complex mixture of many bioactive molecules including terpenophenolic compounds known as phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids come in neutral forms (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC; cannabidiol, CBD; etc.) or as acid precursors, which are dominant in the plant (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, THCA; cannabidiolic acid, CBDA; etc.). There is increasing interest in unlocking the therapeutic applications of the phytocannabinoid acids; however, the present understanding of the basic pharmacology of phytocannabinoid acids is limited. Herein the brain and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of CBDA, THCA, cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) were examined following intraperitoneal administration in mice. Next it was examined whether CBDA was anticonvulsant in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1aRX/+ mice). All the phytocannabinoid acids investigated were rapidly absorbed with plasma tmax values of between 15 and 45 min and had relatively short half-lives (<4 h). The brain-plasma ratios for the acids were very low at <=0.04. However, when CBDA was administered in an alternate Tween 80-based vehicle, it exhibited a brain-plasma ratio of 1.9. The anticonvulsant potential of CBDA was examined using this vehicle, and it was found that CBDA significantly increased the temperature threshold at which the Scn1aRX/+ mice had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Around 30% of patients with epilepsy show drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into \"authorized\" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and \"off-label\" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings.",

However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the main components of the cannabis plant that has demonstrated anti-epileptic seizure effect. Following its clinical development, in September 2019 the European Medicines Agency approved its indication for the adjunctive therapy of epileptic seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS), combined with clobazam (CLB), in patients of 2 years of age and older. AIM: To establish recommendations on the use of plant-derived highly purified CBD on which Spanish experts have reached consensus for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with DS and LGS based on their clinical experience and the scientific evidence. DEVELOPMENT: Consensus meeting with the participation of four Spanish neurologists and neuropediatric who are experts in epilepsy secondary to DS and LGS and with clinical experience in the use and management of CBD. They discussed on several topics, including posology (starting dose, dose escalation schema), efficacy (assessment of outcomes and indications for treatment withdrawal), and safety (evaluation, drug-drug interactions, adverse events management). CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimise CBD treatment, a slow dose escalation (= 4 weeks) is recommended until the maximum recommended dose or the desire effect is reached. It is also recommended that the concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) be reduced in case of adverse events due to interactions, and that the treatment continues for at least 6 months if it is well tolerated. The efficacy and safety of CBD must be assessed individually, considering the benefits and risks for individual patients.",

Anecdotal reports also suggest a positive effect on nonseizure outcomes. In this study, we aimed to identify, through a caregiver survey which nonseizure outcomes were most likely to change in these patients. METHODS: The BEhavior, COgnition, and More with Epidiolex  (BECOME) was a 20-minute, cross-sectional, online survey that was developed with extensive input from caregivers, healthcare professionals, and epilepsy researchers, and was based on questions from validated measures and previously published caregiver reports. US-based caregivers (from Jazz Pharmaceuticals patient/caregiver database) of people with LGS or DS who were treated with CBD (Epidiolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) for >=3 months were asked to compare the past month to the period before CBD initiation and rate their impression of changes using symmetrical Likert scales. RESULTS: A total of 498 caregivers (97% parents) of patients with LGS (80%) or DS (20%) completed the survey. Mean (range) age of patients was 16 (1-73) years, and 52% were male. Patients were taking a median CBD dose of 14 mg/kg/d and median 4 concomitant antiseizure medications. A large proportion of respondents reported improvements in >=1 survey question for all nonseizure-related domains: alertness, cognition, and executive function (85%); emotional functioning (82%); language and communication (79% in nonverbal patients and 74% in verbal); activities of daily living (51%); sleep (51%); and physical functioning (46%). Respondents reported improvements in seizure-related domains, including overall seizure frequency (85%), overall seizure severity (76%), seizure-free days per week for >=1 seizure type (67%), and seizure freedom during the past month (16%). The majority of respondents who reported reduction in seizure frequency also reported improvements in nonseizure outcomes domains (51-80%). However, improvements in nonseizure outcomes (18-56%) were also reported in patients who either had no change or worsening of seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This survey characterized and quantified caregiver impression of changes in the seizure and nonseizure outcomes in patients taking add-on CBD treatment. Overall, 93% of caregivers reported planning to continue CBD treatment, primarily because of reduced seizure burden but also because of improvements in nonseizure-related outcomes. Despite the limitations that are associated with a retrospective survey-based study design, these results support further evaluation of the effect of CBD treatment on nonseizure outcomes among patients with LGS or DS.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Around 30% of patients with epilepsy show drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into \"authorized\" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and \"off-label\" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings.",

METHODS: Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex  in the US; Epidyolex  in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.",

METHODS: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion of patients who achieved >=50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: Four trials were included and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the >=50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). SIGNIFICANCE: CBD was associated with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.",

                    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa produces a complex mixture of many bioactive molecules including terpenophenolic compounds known as phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids come in neutral forms (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC; cannabidiol, CBD; etc.) or as acid precursors, which are dominant in the plant (e.g., Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, THCA; cannabidiolic acid, CBDA; etc.). There is increasing interest in unlocking the therapeutic applications of the phytocannabinoid acids; however, the present understanding of the basic pharmacology of phytocannabinoid acids is limited. Herein the brain and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of CBDA, THCA, cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) were examined following intraperitoneal administration in mice. Next it was examined whether CBDA was anticonvulsant in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1aRX/+ mice). All the phytocannabinoid acids investigated were rapidly absorbed with plasma tmax values of between 15 and 45 min and had relatively short half-lives (<4 h). The brain-plasma ratios for the acids were very low at <=0.04. However, when CBDA was administered in an alternate Tween 80-based vehicle, it exhibited a brain-plasma ratio of 1.9. The anticonvulsant potential of CBDA was examined using this vehicle, and it was found that CBDA significantly increased the temperature threshold at which the Scn1aRX/+ mice had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.",

METHODS: Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex  in the US; Epidyolex  in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

Following its clinical development, in September 2019 the European Medicines Agency approved its indication for the adjunctive therapy of epileptic seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS), combined with clobazam (CLB), in patients of 2 years of age and older. AIM: To establish recommendations on the use of plant-derived highly purified CBD on which Spanish experts have reached consensus for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with DS and LGS based on their clinical experience and the scientific evidence. DEVELOPMENT: Consensus meeting with the participation of four Spanish neurologists and neuropediatric who are experts in epilepsy secondary to DS and LGS and with clinical experience in the use and management of CBD. They discussed on several topics, including posology (starting dose, dose escalation schema), efficacy (assessment of outcomes and indications for treatment withdrawal), and safety (evaluation, drug-drug interactions, adverse events management). CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimise CBD treatment, a slow dose escalation (= 4 weeks) is recommended until the maximum recommended dose or the desire effect is reached. It is also recommended that the concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) be reduced in case of adverse events due to interactions, and that the treatment continues for at least 6 months if it is well tolerated. The efficacy and safety of CBD must be assessed individually, considering the benefits and risks for individual patients.",

Here we tested whether catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)-mediated Scn1a gene activation can rescue Scn1a haploinsufficiency in a mouse DS model and restore physiological levels of its gene product, the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. We screened single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for their ability to stimulate Scn1a transcription in association with the dCas9 activation system. We identified a specific sgRNA that increases Scn1a gene expression levels in cell lines and primary neurons with high specificity. Nav1.1 protein levels were augmented, as was the ability of wild-type immature GABAergic interneurons to fire action potentials. A similar enhancement of Scn1a transcription was achieved in mature DS interneurons, rescuing their ability to fire. To test the therapeutic potential of this approach, we delivered the Scn1a-dCas9 activation system to DS pups using adeno-associated viruses. Parvalbumin interneurons recovered their firing ability, and febrile seizures were significantly attenuated. Our results pave the way for exploiting dCas9-based gene activation as an effective and targeted approach to DS and other disorders resulting from altered gene dosage.",

Most patients with DS harbor loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV)1.1 alpha subunit and has been associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Here, we generated a split-intein form of SCN1A and used a dual-vector delivery approach to circumvent adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging limitations. In addition, we applied previously developed enhancer technology to produce an interneuron-specific gene replacement therapy for DS, called DLX2.0-SCN1A. The split-intein SCN1A vectors produced full-length NaV1.1 protein, and functional sodium channels were recorded in HEK293 cells in vitro. Administration of dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs to wild-type mice produced full-length, reconstituted human protein by Western blot and telencephalic interneuron-specific and dose-dependent NaV1.1 expression by immunohistochemistry. These vectors also conferred strong dose-dependent protection against postnatal mortality and seizures in Scn1afl/+;Meox2-Cre and Scn1a+/R613X DS mouse models. Injection of single or dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs into wild-type mice did not result in increased mortality, weight loss, or gliosis as measured by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, expression of SCN1A in all neurons driven by the human SYNAPSIN I promoter caused an adverse effect marked by increased mortality in the preweaning period, before disease onset. These findings demonstrate proof of concept that interneuron-specific AAV-mediated SCN1A gene replacement can rescue DS phenotypes in mouse models and suggest that it could be a therapeutic approach for patients with DS.",

In principle, IDNT (particularly those of monogenic causes) are amenable to gene replacement therapy via precise genetic correction. However, practical challenges for gene replacement therapy remain major hurdles for its translation from bench to bedside.

METHODS: Two-medical referral centers, retrospective cohort study. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Taoyuan Chang Gung Children's hospital and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We reviewed the medical records of 23 patients with RSE/SRSE who were admitted to PICU from January 2014 to December 2017. Of these, 11 patients received TH (TH group) and 12 patients did not (control group). RESULTS: The selective endpoints were RSE/SRSE duration, length of PICU stay, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. We applied TH using the Artic Sun  temperature management system (target temperature, 34-35  C; duration, 48-72 h). Of the 11 patients who received TH, 7 had febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRSE), one had Dravet syndrome, and three had traumatic brain injury. The TH group had significantly shortern seizure durations than did the control group (hrs; median (IQR) 24(40) vs. 96(90), p < 0.05). Two patients in the TH group died of pulmonary embolism and extreme brain edema. The length of PICU stay was similar between the groups (days; median (IQR) 30(42) v.s 30.5(30.25)). The TH group had significantly better long-term outcomes than did the control group (GOS score, median (IQR) 4(2) v.s 3 (0.75), p = 0.01*). The TH group had a significantly lower incidence of later chronic refractory epilepsy than did the control group (TH v.s non-TH, 5/11 (45%) v.s. 12/12(100%), p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TH effectively reduced the seizure burden in patients with RSE/SRSE. Our findings support that for patients with RSE/SRSE, TH shortens the seizure duration, ultimately reducing the occurrence of post-status epilepticus epilepsy and improving patients' long-term survival.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

METHODS: Long-term outcomes from a Norwegian VNS quality registry are reported in 105 patients with DEEs (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [LGS] n = 62; Dravet n = 16; Rett n = 9; other syndromes n = 18) were compared with 212 epilepsy patients without ID, with median follow-up of 88 and 72 months, respectively. Total seizure reduction was evaluated at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months. Effect on different seizure types was evaluated at baseline and last observation carried forward (LOCF). RESULTS: Median monthly seizure frequency at LOCF was reduced by 42.2% (p < 0.001) in patients with DEE and by 55.8% (p < 0.001) in patients without ID. In DEE patients, >=50% seizure reduction at 6 and 24 months were 17.1% and 37.1%, respectively, and 33.5% and 48.6% for patients without ID. Seizure reduction >=75% at 60 months occurred in 14.3% of DEE patients and 23.1% of patients without ID. Highest median reduction was for atonic seizures, most notably 64.6% for LGS patients. A better effect was seen at 2 years among DEE patients with unchanged medication compared with those with changed medication (54.5% vs. 35.6% responders, p = 0.078). More DEE patients were reported to have greater improvement in ictal or postictal severity (43.8% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.006) and alertness (62.9% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001) than patients without ID. For both groups, use of the magnet reduced seizure severity. Hoarseness was the most common adverse effect in both groups. In addition, DEE patients were frequently reported to have sleep disturbance, general discomfort, or abdominal problems. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that VNS is very effective for atonic seizures. Patients without ID had best overall seizure reduction, however, patients with DEE had higher retention rates probably due to other positive effects. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: DEE refers to a group of patients with severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. Many of these patients have restricted lifestyles with frequent seizures. VNS is a treatment option for patients who do not respond well to medicines, either because of insufficient effect or serious adverse effects. Our study shows that VNS is well tolerated in this patient group and leads to a reduction in all seizure types, most notably for seizures leading to fall.

METHODS: Long-term outcomes from a Norwegian VNS quality registry are reported in 105 patients with DEEs (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [LGS] n = 62; Dravet n = 16; Rett n = 9; other syndromes n = 18) were compared with 212 epilepsy patients without ID, with median follow-up of 88 and 72 months, respectively. Total seizure reduction was evaluated at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months. Effect on different seizure types was evaluated at baseline and last observation carried forward (LOCF). RESULTS: Median monthly seizure frequency at LOCF was reduced by 42.2% (p < 0.001) in patients with DEE and by 55.8% (p < 0.001) in patients without ID. In DEE patients, >=50% seizure reduction at 6 and 24 months were 17.1% and 37.1%, respectively, and 33.5% and 48.6% for patients without ID. Seizure reduction >=75% at 60 months occurred in 14.3% of DEE patients and 23.1% of patients without ID. Highest median reduction was for atonic seizures, most notably 64.6% for LGS patients. A better effect was seen at 2 years among DEE patients with unchanged medication compared with those with changed medication (54.5% vs. 35.6% responders, p = 0.078). More DEE patients were reported to have greater improvement in ictal or postictal severity (43.8% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.006) and alertness (62.9% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001) than patients without ID. For both groups, use of the magnet reduced seizure severity. Hoarseness was the most common adverse effect in both groups. In addition, DEE patients were frequently reported to have sleep disturbance, general discomfort, or abdominal problems. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that VNS is very effective for atonic seizures. Patients without ID had best overall seizure reduction, however, patients with DEE had higher retention rates probably due to other positive effects. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: DEE refers to a group of patients with severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. Many of these patients have restricted lifestyles with frequent seizures. VNS is a treatment option for patients who do not respond well to medicines, either because of insufficient effect or serious adverse effects. Our study shows that VNS is well tolerated in this patient group and leads to a reduction in all seizure types, most notably for seizures leading to fall.

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

It is characterized by frequent and prolonged seizures, developmental delays, and various other neurological and behavioral impairments. Most cases result from pathogenic mutations in the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene, which encodes a critical voltage-gated sodium channel subunit involved in neuronal excitability. Precision medicine offers significant potential for improving DS diagnosis and treatment. Early genetic testing enables timely and accurate diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of DS's underlying genetic mechanisms and neurobiology have enabled the development of targeted therapies, such as gene therapy, offering more effective and less invasive treatment options for patients with DS. Targeted and gene therapies provide hope for more effective and personalized treatments. However, research into novel approaches remains in its early stages, and their clinical application remains to be seen. This review addresses the current understanding of clinical DS features, genetic involvement in DS development, and outcomes of novel DS therapies.",

The major obstruction to effective therapies for neurological disorders is the poor understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which allows precise and effective gene editing in almost any cell type and organism, is accelerating the pace of basic biological research. An increasing number of groups are focusing on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of neurological disorders and developing novel therapies using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This review highlights the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the treatment of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Dravet syndrome, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Hopefully, it will improve our understanding of neurological disorders and give insights into future treatments for neurological disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a rare and drug-resistant form of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which is both debilitating and challenging to manage, typically arising during the first year of life, with seizures often triggered by fever, infections, or vaccinations. It is characterized by frequent and prolonged seizures, developmental delays, and various other neurological and behavioral impairments. Most cases result from pathogenic mutations in the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene, which encodes a critical voltage-gated sodium channel subunit involved in neuronal excitability. Precision medicine offers significant potential for improving DS diagnosis and treatment. Early genetic testing enables timely and accurate diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of DS's underlying genetic mechanisms and neurobiology have enabled the development of targeted therapies, such as gene therapy, offering more effective and less invasive treatment options for patients with DS. Targeted and gene therapies provide hope for more effective and personalized treatments. However, research into novel approaches remains in its early stages, and their clinical application remains to be seen. This review addresses the current understanding of clinical DS features, genetic involvement in DS development, and outcomes of novel DS therapies.",

Following its clinical development, in September 2019 the European Medicines Agency approved its indication for the adjunctive therapy of epileptic seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS), combined with clobazam (CLB), in patients of 2 years of age and older. AIM: To establish recommendations on the use of plant-derived highly purified CBD on which Spanish experts have reached consensus for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with DS and LGS based on their clinical experience and the scientific evidence. DEVELOPMENT: Consensus meeting with the participation of four Spanish neurologists and neuropediatric who are experts in epilepsy secondary to DS and LGS and with clinical experience in the use and management of CBD. They discussed on several topics, including posology (starting dose, dose escalation schema), efficacy (assessment of outcomes and indications for treatment withdrawal), and safety (evaluation, drug-drug interactions, adverse events management). CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimise CBD treatment, a slow dose escalation (= 4 weeks) is recommended until the maximum recommended dose or the desire effect is reached. It is also recommended that the concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) be reduced in case of adverse events due to interactions, and that the treatment continues for at least 6 months if it is well tolerated. The efficacy and safety of CBD must be assessed individually, considering the benefits and risks for individual patients.",

In recent years, the treatment landscape of DS has changed considerably, and a comprehensive systematic review of the contemporary literature is lacking. Here we synthesized published evidence on the occurrence of clinical impacts by age, the economic and humanistic (health-related quality-of-life [HRQoL]) burden, and health state utility. We provide an evidence-based, contemporary visualization of the clinical manifestations, highlighting that DS is not limited to seizures; non-seizure manifestations appear early in life and increase over time, contributing significantly to the economic and humanistic burden of disease. The primary drivers of HRQoL in DS include seizure severity, cognition, and motor and behavioral problems; in turn, these directly affect caregivers through the extent of assistance required and consequent impact on activities of daily living. Unsurprisingly, costs are driven by seizure-related events, hospitalizations, and in-home medical care visits. This systematic review highlights a paucity of longitudinal data; most studies meeting inclusion criteria were cross-sectional or had short follow-up. Nonetheless, available data illustrate the substantial impact on individuals, their families, and healthcare systems and establish the need for novel therapies to address the complex spectrum of DS manifestations.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

METHODS: The subjects were 220 patients (89 males, 131 females) who had been treated at our pediatric epilepsy clinic and had transferred to adult care between 2014 and 2018 without attending a transition clinic or program. The demographic data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The ages at transition ranged from 15 to 54 years (median: 27 years old). There were 91 patients with focal epilepsies (FEs) and 129 patients with generalized epilepsies [genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) n = 30, generalized epilepsy of various etiologies (GEv) n = 99]. A most frequent epileptic syndrome was temporal lobe epilepsy followed by frontal lobe epilepsy in FEs, GTCS only followed by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in GGE and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome followed by Dravet syndrome in GEv. At the age of transition, a total of 77 of the 96 patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) had pharmacoresistant seizures, which was positively correlated with a late transition age (P<=0.05). More than monthly seizures and greater than moderate disabilities were noted in 45% and 55% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The patients with childhood-onset epilepsy transitioned to adult care from the hospital-based pediatric epilepsy clinic were characterized by generalized>focal epilepsy, a frequent complication of DEE, more than monthly seizures, and worse than moderate intellectual disabilities. The complication of DEE made a smooth transition difficult and delayed the transition age.",

However, vaccination is a common seizure trigger in individuals with Dravet syndrome (DS). Information surrounding COVID-19 vaccine side effects in patients with DS would aid caregivers and providers in decisions for and management of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A survey was emailed to the Dravet Syndrome Foundation's Family Network and posted to the Dravet Parent & Caregiver Support Group on Facebook between May and August 2021. Deidentified information obtained included demographics and vaccination status for individuals with DS. Vaccine type, side effects, preventative measures, and changes in seizure activity following COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. For unvaccinated individuals, caregivers were asked about intent to vaccinate and reasons for their decision. RESULTS: Of 278 survey responses, 120 represented vaccinated individuals with DS (median age = 19.5 years), with 50% reporting no side effects from COVID-19 vaccination. Increased seizures following COVID-19 vaccination were reported in 16 individuals, but none had status epilepticus. Of the 158 individuals who had not received a COVID-19 vaccination, 37 were older than 12 years (i.e., eligible at time of study), and only six of these caregivers indicated intent to seek vaccination. The remaining 121 responses were caregivers to children younger than 12 years, 60 of whom indicated they would not seek COVID-19 vaccination when their child with DS became eligible. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy were fear of increased seizure activity and concerns about vaccine safety. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate COVID-19 vaccination is well tolerated by individuals with DS. One main reason for vaccine hesitancy was fear of increased seizure activity, which occurred in only 13% of vaccinated individuals, and none had status epilepticus. This study provides critical and reassuring insights for caregivers and health care providers making decisions about the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations for individuals with DS.",

METHODS: The medical records of all individuals consecutively treated with STP as add-on therapy for refractory epilepsies, irrespective of their being focal, generalized, or both, and followed at Meyer Children's Hospital between January 2007 and May 2018, were reviewed. The drug scheme administration consisted of a starting dose of STP of 10-15 mg/kg/d with increments every week, up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d, based on both age and weight. Etiology of epilepsy was codified as structural, genetic, infectious, immune, metabolic, and unknown. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a seizure frequency reduction of >=50%. Retention rate was defined as the probability of continuing STP without additional therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reporting adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 132 individuals aged from 5 months to 43 years received add-on STP, including 30 patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). The median follow-up was 14.8 months (range = 4 months-18 years, interquartile range = 25.72). Twenty-nine individuals (22%) received more than two antiepileptic drugs. Benzodiazepines, mainly clobazam, were the most commonly used add-on drugs. Sixty-six patients (50%) were responders, and 13 of them (9.8%) were seizure-free. Responder rate was higher in the genetic etiology group (57%), especially in DS (18/30; 60%), and in patients with refractory focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (5/15; 33%). The median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the 66 responders. The median time to STP failure was 24.6 months in all 132 individuals. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms the long-term efficacy of add-on STP treatment in patients with different types of refractory epilepsies, including focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

METHODS: Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex  in the US; Epidyolex  in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.",

The large number of different syndromes and seizure types as well as the highly variable inter-individual response to the therapies makes management of this condition often challenging. In the last two decades, a genetic etiology has been revealed in more than half of all epilepsies and single gene defects in ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors have been associated with most inherited forms of epilepsy, including some focal and lesional forms as well as specific epileptic developmental encephalopathies. Several genetic tests are now available, including targeted assays up to revolutionary tools that have made sequencing of all coding (whole exome) and non-coding (whole genome) regions of the human genome possible. These recent technological advances have also driven genetic discovery in epilepsy and increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many epileptic disorders, eventually providing targets for precision medicine in some syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome, pyroxidine-dependent epilepsy, and glucose transporter 1 deficiency. However, these examples represent a relatively small subset of all types of epilepsy, and to date, precision medicine in epilepsy has primarily focused on seizure control, and other clinical aspects, such as neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, have yet been possible to address. We herein summarize the most recent advances in genetic testing and provide up-to-date approaches for the choice of the correct test for some epileptic disorders and tailored treatments that are already applicable in some monogenic epilepsies. In the next years, the most probably scenario is that epilepsy treatment will be very different from the currently almost empirical approach, eventually with a \"precision medicine\" approach applicable on a large scale.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy and tolerability of stiripentol (STP) as an adjunctive treatment in different forms of refractory epilepsies. METHODS: The medical records of all individuals consecutively treated with STP as add-on therapy for refractory epilepsies, irrespective of their being focal, generalized, or both, and followed at Meyer Children's Hospital between January 2007 and May 2018, were reviewed. The drug scheme administration consisted of a starting dose of STP of 10-15 mg/kg/d with increments every week, up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d, based on both age and weight. Etiology of epilepsy was codified as structural, genetic, infectious, immune, metabolic, and unknown. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a seizure frequency reduction of >=50%. Retention rate was defined as the probability of continuing STP without additional therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reporting adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 132 individuals aged from 5 months to 43 years received add-on STP, including 30 patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). The median follow-up was 14.8 months (range = 4 months-18 years, interquartile range = 25.72). Twenty-nine individuals (22%) received more than two antiepileptic drugs. Benzodiazepines, mainly clobazam, were the most commonly used add-on drugs. Sixty-six patients (50%) were responders, and 13 of them (9.8%) were seizure-free. Responder rate was higher in the genetic etiology group (57%), especially in DS (18/30; 60%), and in patients with refractory focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (5/15; 33%). The median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the 66 responders. The median time to STP failure was 24.6 months in all 132 individuals. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms the long-term efficacy of add-on STP treatment in patients with different types of refractory epilepsies, including focal onset epilepsy without bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Further confirmations based on prospectively designed studies are required to confirm STP efficacy in focal epilepsy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are rare and debilitating forms of epilepsy, characterised by recurrent, severe, drug-resistant seizures and neurodevelopmental impairments. A non-euphoric, plant-derived, highly purified formulation of cannabidiol (CBD; Epidyolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) is approved in the European Union and United Kingdom for use in patients aged >=2 years for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS in conjunction with clobazam (CLB), and for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients aged >=2 years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies who were treated with adjunctive CBD at six epilepsy centres in Germany. We analysed patient and treatment characteristics, seizure outcomes, treatment retention rates (i.e. the proportion of patients remaining on CBD treatment at time of assessment and retention as estimated by Kaplan-Meier [KM] analyses), physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and adverse events (AEs) for up to 12 months. Here, we report data from this chart review for those patients with LGS or DS receiving adjunctive treatment with concomitant CBD and CLB. RESULTS: We identified 126 patients (102 LGS; 24 DS) receiving CBD and CLB, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 23.2 (15.8) years and a mean (SD) age of epilepsy onset of 3 (3.7) years. Patients had received a median (range) number of prior antiseizure medications (ASMs) of 6 (1-24) and concomitant ASMs of 3 (1-7). The median target CBD dose was 11.1 mg/kg/day in the total population (17.8, 15.8, and 9.7 mg/kg/day in the <6 years, 6-17 years, and >=18 years subgroups, respectively). The median time to the target dose was 21-22 days across age groups. The median concomitant CLB dose was 0.14 mg/kg/day (0.38, 0.22, and 0.10 mg/kg/day in the respective age groups). A >=50% reduction in total seizures was observed in 47.5% of patients at 3 months (35.7-52.6% across age groups) and 45.5% of patients at 12 months (44.4-46.2% across age groups). For generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a >=50% reduction was observed in 63.0% of patients at 3 months (60.7-66.7% across age groups) and 56.9% of patients at 12 months (50.0-75.0% across age groups). Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 30 (range: 0.5-30) at baseline to 15 (range: 0-30) at the last follow-up (p <0.001). Overall, 89.7%, 80.7%, and 69.8% patients remained on CBD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. KM estimated treatment retention was similar across paediatric and adult groups, according to earlier or later initiation (e.g. <=4 vs >=15 prior and concomitant ASMs) and according to the syndrome (LGS and DS). Physicians rated 66% of patients demonstrated a CGI-C improvement and 67% demonstrated a CGI-C behaviour improvement. The most common AEs (>=5%) were sedation (n = 30, 23.8%), diarrhoea (n = 13, 10.3%) and psycho-behavioural AEs (n = 9, 7.1%). CONCLUSION: In this chart review of patients with severe treatment refractory LGS or DS receiving adjunctive CBD and CLB concomitantly, a reduction in seizure frequency and sustained treatment retention was observed for up to 12 months across age groups in real-world clinical practice. CBD discontinuations exclusively due to AEs were infrequent and the AE profile was generally aligned to that previously observed.",

METHODS: Questionnaire responses from 93 DS patients and their caregivers were matched by age and gender with responses from 93 DRE and 93 SR patients collected in independent studies, and were compared across main components of QoL, direct costs (patient visits, medication use, care level, medical equipment, and ancillary treatments), and indirect costs (quitting job, reduced working hours, missed days). RESULTS: Mean total direct costs were highest for DS patients ($4864 [median $3564] vs $3049 [median $1506] for DRE [excluding outliers], P = 0.01; and $1007 [median $311], P < 0.001 for SR). Total lost productivity over 3 months was highest among caregivers of pediatric DS ($4757, median $2841), compared with those of DRE ($1541, P < 0.001; median $0) and SR patients ($891, P < 0.001; median $0). The proportions of caregivers in employment were similar across groups (62% DS, 63% DRE, and 63% SR) but DS caregivers were more likely to experience changes to their working situation, such as quitting their job (40% DS vs 16% DRE and 9% SR, P < 0.001 in both comparisons). KINDL scores were significantly lower for DS patients (62 vs 74 and 72, P < 0.001 in both comparisons), and lower than for the average German population (77). Pediatric caregiver EQ-5D scores across all cohorts were comparable with population norms, but more DS caregivers experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms (24% vs 11% and 5%). Mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score was significantly higher in DS caregivers than either of the other groups (P < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: This first comparative study of Dravet syndrome to difficult-to-treat epilepsy and to epilepsy patients in seizure remission emphasizes the excess burden of DS in components of QoL and direct costs. The caregivers of DS patients have a greater impairment of their working lives (indirect costs) and increased depression symptoms.",

METHODS: The subjects were 220 patients (89 males, 131 females) who had been treated at our pediatric epilepsy clinic and had transferred to adult care between 2014 and 2018 without attending a transition clinic or program. The demographic data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The ages at transition ranged from 15 to 54 years (median: 27 years old). There were 91 patients with focal epilepsies (FEs) and 129 patients with generalized epilepsies [genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) n = 30, generalized epilepsy of various etiologies (GEv) n = 99]. A most frequent epileptic syndrome was temporal lobe epilepsy followed by frontal lobe epilepsy in FEs, GTCS only followed by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in GGE and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome followed by Dravet syndrome in GEv. At the age of transition, a total of 77 of the 96 patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) had pharmacoresistant seizures, which was positively correlated with a late transition age (P<=0.05). More than monthly seizures and greater than moderate disabilities were noted in 45% and 55% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The patients with childhood-onset epilepsy transitioned to adult care from the hospital-based pediatric epilepsy clinic were characterized by generalized>focal epilepsy, a frequent complication of DEE, more than monthly seizures, and worse than moderate intellectual disabilities. The complication of DEE made a smooth transition difficult and delayed the transition age.",

METHODS: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion of patients who achieved >=50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: Four trials were included and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the >=50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). SIGNIFICANCE: CBD was associated with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.",

We designed a CRISPR-based gene therapy for Scn1a-haplodeficient mice using multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) in the promoter regions together with the nuclease-deficient Cas9 fused to transcription activators (dCas9-VPR) to trigger the transcription of SCN1A or Scn1a in vitro. We tested the effect of this strategy in vivo using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated system targeting inhibitory neurons and investigating febrile seizures and behavioral parameters. In both the human and mouse genes multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) in the upstream, rather than downstream, promoter region showed high and synergistic activities to increase the transcription of SCN1A or Scn1a in cultured cells. Intravenous injections of AAV particles containing the optimal combination of 4 gRNAs into transgenic mice with Scn1a-haplodeficiency and inhibitory neuron-specific expression of dCas9-VPR at four weeks of age increased Nav1.1 expression in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons, ameliorated their febrile seizures and improved their behavioral impairments. Although the usage of transgenic mice and rather modest improvements in seizures and abnormal behaviors hamper direct clinical application, our results indicate that the upregulation of Scn1a expression in the inhibitory neurons can significantly improve the phenotypes, even when applied after the juvenile stages. Our findings also suggest that the decrease in Nav1.1 is directly involved in the symptoms seen in adults with Dravet syndrome and open a way to improve this condition.",

                    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A (haploinsufficiency), located on chromosome 2q24, with decreased function of Nav1.1 sodium channels in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Pharmacoresistant seizures in DS start in the infancy in the form of hemiclonic febrile status epilepticus. Later, other intractable seizure types develop including myoclonic seizures. Early normal development in infancy evolves into moderate to severe intellectual impairment, motor impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and later a characteristic crouching gait. Clobazam, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation had been shown to be effective, but even with polytherapy, only 10% of patients get adequate seizure control. The author provides a narrative review of the current treatment paradigm as well as recent advances in the management of DS based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMed and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. In recent years, the treatment paradigm of DS is changing with the approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol oil and stiripentol. Another novel antiepileptic drug (AED), fenfluramine, had also shown excellent efficacy in phase 3 studies of DS. However, these AEDs primarily control seizures without addressing the underlying pathogenesis and other important common comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, autistic behavior, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and motor impairment including crouching gait. Several agents targeted for DS are in the developmental stage: TAK935, lorcaserin, clemizole, huperzine analog, ataluren, selective sodium channel modulators and activators, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and adenoviral vector therapy. As DS is associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, seizure detection devices can be used in this population for testing and clinical validation of these devices.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients, who were implanted with VNS between the years 2005 and 2020, were retrospectively included in the study. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, epilepsy types, VNS implantation year, replacement year, pre and post-VNS seizure frequency, number of responders, number of antiseizure medication and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 41 patients were included in the study. The number of patients with focal epilepsy was 21 (51.2%). 10 patients (24.4%) had generalized epilepsy and 10 patients (24.4%) had ?combined generalized and focal epilepsy? (Lennox-Gastaut, Dravet syndrome). The Pre-VNS median seizure frequency was 1.5/day in the focal group, 0.6/day in the generalized group and 6/day in the combined group. Seizure frequencies dropped to 0.3/day in the focal group, 0.2/day in the generalized group and 3.0/day in the combined group at the 12th month after VNS (p < 0.001, p=0.004, p < 0.001). The response rate was found to be 68.3% at the 12th month after VNS. The number of antiseizure medications was decreased from 3.6/day to 3.1/day at the 12th months after VNS (p < 0.001). Two patients? (4.9%) VNS therapy was discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that VNS therapy is safe and effective in focal, generalized and combined epilepsy types. Despite having a low seizure freedom rate, VNS is a good alternative treatment option for patients who for any reason are not candidates for resective surgery.",

Plentiful efforts have been made for delivering VNS to DS patients, but its effectiveness still requires further verification. We investigated the effectiveness of the VNS treatment of DS patients using brain connectivity analysis with electroencephalography (EEG). APPROACH: Twenty pharmaco-resistant DS patients were selected to undergo VNS implantation and classified into responder and non-responder groups after 24 months post-VNS. The effect of VNS between 6 months pre- and 6, 12, and 24 months post-VNS in all patients, responders, and non-responders on four different frequency categories of four brain parameters were compared using resting-state EEG. MAIN RESULTS: In alpha and beta bands, all patients showed positive results for characteristic path length (CPL), global efficiency (GE), and transitivity after VNS treatment, and changes in betweenness centrality (BC) were not significant. The difference in transitivity between responders and non-responders is more pronounced than those in CPL and GE are, in both the alpha (p < 0.015) and beta (p < 0.001) bands. There was an obvious change in BC, especially in the alpha band, as the hubs tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders; however, there was no change for the non-responders. SIGNIFICANCE: We investigated the alteration in brain connectivity of DS patients in alpha and beta bands during a long-term follow-up and found the responders have a decreased transitivity after the VNS treatment. Moreover, the hubs with high values in the alpha band tended to move from frontal lobe to parietal lobe for responders after VNS treatment.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) are two serious epileptic syndromes with paediatric onset which are refractory to therapy and are associated with an important increase in mortality rates and comorbidities compared to the general population. These pathologies have a strong impact on the lives of patients and their families, because they undergo multiple pharmacological therapies (many of them without specific indication), with frequent changes due to poor efficacy and associated adverse effects. The specialists who care for these patients highlight unmet needs and the lack of specific, safe and effective treatments for better management of the syndrome. DEVELOPMENT: A group of four neurologists specializing in epilepsy has met to review the scientific literature and evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral solution cannabidiol in the treatment of these syndromes, both in randomized clinical trials (CT) and in some observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol is positioned as an innovative therapy that allows better control of epileptic seizures and comorbidities of DS and LGS, furthermore its efficacy and safety have been evaluated in more than 700 patients. In CTs, cannabidiol significantly reduced the percentage of convulsive seizures and drop seizures compared to placebo in patients with DS and LGS respectively, which could improve their quality of life and that of their family members. The most frequent adverse effects reported were somnolence and decreased appetite. Elevated liver aminotransferase levels were also reported, especially in patients given concomitant sodium valproate. This therapy may allow better control of the epileptic seizures associated with these syndromes.",
