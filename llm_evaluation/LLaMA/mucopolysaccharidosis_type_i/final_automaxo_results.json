                    "abstract": "Many neuropathic diseases cause early, irreversible neurologic deterioration, which warrants therapeutic intervention during the first months of life. In the case of mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), one of the most promising treatment approaches is to restore enzyme expression through gene therapy. Specifically, administering pantropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding IDUA into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via suboccipital administration has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in large animals. Preclinical safety studies conducted in adult nonhuman primates supported a positive risk-benefit profile of the procedure while highlighting potential subclinical toxicity to primary sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This study investigated the long-term performance of intrathecal cervical AAV serotype 9 gene transfer of human IDUA administered to 1-month-old rhesus monkeys (N = 4) with half of the animals tolerized to the human transgene at birth via systemic administration of an AAV serotype 8 vector expressing human IDUA from the liver. Sustained expression of the transgene for almost 4 years is reported in all animals. Transduced cells were primarily pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lower motor neurons, and DRG neurons. Both tolerized and non-tolerized animals were robust and maintained transgene expression as measured by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue. However, the presence of antibodies in the non-tolerized animals led to a loss of measurable levels of secreted enzyme in the CSF. These results support the safety and efficiency of treating neonatal rhesus monkeys with AAV serotype 9 gene therapy delivered into the CSF.",

However, in the clinical trial, the efficacy needs to be improved due to the low transgene expression level. To this end, we designed a proprietary system (PS) gene editing approach with CRISPR to insert a promoterless alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) cDNA sequence into the albumin locus of hepatocytes. In this study, adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vectors delivering the PS gene editing system were injected into neonatal and adult MPS I mice. IDUA enzyme activity in the brain significantly increased, while storage levels were normalized. Neurobehavioral tests showed that treated mice had better memory and learning ability. Also, histological analysis showed efficacy reflected by the absence of foam cells in the liver and vacuolation in neuronal cells. No vector-associated toxicity or increased tumorigenesis risk was observed. Moreover, no off-target effects were detected through the unbiased genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) analysis. In summary, these results showed the safety and efficacy of the PS in treating MPS I and paved the way for clinical studies. Additionally, as a therapeutic platform, the PS has the potential to treat other lysosomal diseases.",

Despite the recognizable morphological and behavioral deficits associated with MPS I, neither the underlying alterations in functional neural connectivity nor its restoration following gene therapy have been shown. By employing high-resolution resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we found significant reductions in functional neural connectivity in the limbic areas of the brain that play key roles in learning and memory in MPS I mice, and that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy can reestablish most brain connectivity.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: This institutional study reviewed 15 corneas from 9 patients with MPS I spectrum disease who underwent corneal transplant to treat corneal clouding between May 2011 and October 2020. We reviewed the clinical data, hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, and histochemical stains, including those for mucopolysaccharides (Alcian blue and/or colloidal iron). The main outcome measures were pathology observed under light microscopy and postsurgical clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent 15 corneal transplants for corneal clouding (14/15 procedures were deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty). All corneas had mucopolysaccharide deposition visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, which was highlighted in blue with histochemical stains. All corneas also showed alterations in Bowman's layer and the majority also showed epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSION: MPS I shows significant corneal clouding that is successfully treated with deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The excised corneas show characteristic epithelial changes, disruption or breaks in Bowman's membrane, and amphophilic collections of stromal granular mucopolysaccharides which are visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and highlighted by special histochemical stains (Alcian blue and collodial iron). These changes, although subtle, should alert the pathologist to the possibility of an underlying lysosomal storage disorder.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.",

It is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, which lead to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a new and powerful tool that allows gene editing at precise points of the genome, resulting in gene correction through the introduction and genomic integration of a wildtype sequence. In this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to correct in vitro the most common mutation causing MPS I. Human fibroblasts homozygous for p.Trp402* (legacy name W402X) were transfected and analyzed for up to one month after treatment. IDUA activity was significantly increased, lysosomal mass was decreased, and next generation sequencing confirmed that a percentage of cells carried the wildtype sequence. As a proof of concept, this study demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing may be used to correct causative mutations in MPS I. LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.",

However, in the clinical trial, the efficacy needs to be improved due to the low transgene expression level. To this end, we designed a proprietary system (PS) gene editing approach with CRISPR to insert a promoterless alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) cDNA sequence into the albumin locus of hepatocytes. In this study, adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vectors delivering the PS gene editing system were injected into neonatal and adult MPS I mice. IDUA enzyme activity in the brain significantly increased, while storage levels were normalized. Neurobehavioral tests showed that treated mice had better memory and learning ability. Also, histological analysis showed efficacy reflected by the absence of foam cells in the liver and vacuolation in neuronal cells. No vector-associated toxicity or increased tumorigenesis risk was observed. Moreover, no off-target effects were detected through the unbiased genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) analysis. In summary, these results showed the safety and efficacy of the PS in treating MPS I and paved the way for clinical studies. Additionally, as a therapeutic platform, the PS has the potential to treat other lysosomal diseases.",

Short stature and impaired growth velocity are frequent findings in MPS Ia, but they rarely raise suspicion as paediatric endocrinologists are generally poorly trained to detect earlier and milder clinical signs of this condition. Materials and Methods: Following a consensus-based methodology, a multidisciplinary panel including paediatric endocrinologists, paediatricians with expertise in metabolic disorders, radiologists, and rheumatologists shared their experience on a possible clinical approach to the diagnosis of MPS Ia in children with short stature or stunted growth. Results: The result was the formation of an algorithm that illustrates how to raise the suspicion of MPS Ia in a patient older than 5 years with short stature and suggestive clinical signs. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm may represent a useful tool to improve the awareness of paediatric endocrinologists and reduce the diagnostic delay for patients with MPS Ia.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.",

We report the combined 10 year experience of this approach in two paediatric metabolic and transplant centres. Of 81 patients who underwent a first transplant procedure for Hurler, 88% (71/81) survived and 81% (66/81) were alive and engrafted at a median follow-up of 46 months (range 3-124 months). The incidence of grade II-IV acute and any chronic graft versus host disease was 17% and 11% respectively. Urinary glycosaminoglycans were significantly reduced after a period of enzyme replacement therapy, and further reductions were seen at 13-24 months and 25+months after transplantation. In several individuals with decreased cardiac contractility, an improvement of their condition during enzyme replacement therapy enabled them to undergo transplantation, with one individual receiving full intensity conditioning.",

Despite the effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in correcting clinical manifestations related to visceral organs, complete improvement of musculoskeletal and neurocognitive defects remains an unmet challenge and provides an impact on patients' quality of life. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining HSCT and ERT in the neonatal period. Using a mouse model of MPS-I, we demonstrated that the combination therapy improved clinical manifestations in organs usually refractory to current treatment. Moreover, combination with HSCT prevented the production of anti-IDUA antibodies that negatively impact ERT efficacy. The added benefits of combining both treatments also resulted in a reduction of skeletal anomalies and a trend towards decreased neuroinflammation and metabolic abnormalities. As currently there are limited therapeutic options for MPS-I patients, our findings suggest that the combination of HSCT and ERT during the neonatal period may provide a further step forward in the treatment of this rare disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.",

Here, we present an efficient ex vivo genome editing approach using CRISPR-Cas9 that targets the lysosomal enzyme iduronidase to the CCR5 safe harbor locus in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The modified cells secrete supra-endogenous enzyme levels, maintain long-term repopulation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and can improve biochemical and phenotypic abnormalities in an immunocompromised mouse model of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. These studies provide support for the development of genome-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a potential treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.",

                    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the lysosome. Hurler syndrome is the most severe form of MPS I, manifesting as multiorgan dysfunction, cognitive delay, and death, usually within ten years if left untreated. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the optimal treatment option since it provides a permanent solution to enzyme deficiency and halts cognitive decline. However, transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) are HSCT complications that are also known risk factors for bloodstream infections (BSI). BSIs are a serious complication of HSCT, contributing to poor outcomes and transplant-related morbidity. There are little data evaluating BSI after HSCT in the Hurler patient population. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with Hurler syndrome who underwent HSCT at our center between 2013 and 2020 to determine the incidence of BSI within the first-year post-transplant. Twenty-five patients were included in the analysis; the majority (n=17, 68%) were male, with a median age of 1.1 years (IQR 0.35 to 1.44) at the time of transplant. The most common graft source was cord blood (n=15, 54%), followed by bone marrow (n=13, 46%), with the majority from matched unrelated donors (n=14, 52%) and mismatched unrelated donors (n=13, 44%). Sixteen BSIs were diagnosed in 12 patients (n=12, 48%). Most infections (n=7, 43.8%) were diagnosed in the first 20 days after transplant, with fewer infections being observed at later time points. The incidence rate of BSIs in Hurlers patients (n=12, 48%) was higher than the reported general pediatric HSCT population one-year post-transplant (15-35%). Given the high rate of Hurlers patients diagnosed with both TA-TMA and a BSI (n=7, 78%), we suspect a possible correlation between the two. Additionally, due to the time it takes for GAG levels to normalize post-HSCT in Hurlers patients, it is reasonable to suspect that the high BSI rates in these patients are linked to their Hurlers diagnosis.",

Despite the effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in correcting clinical manifestations related to visceral organs, complete improvement of musculoskeletal and neurocognitive defects remains an unmet challenge and provides an impact on patients' quality of life. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining HSCT and ERT in the neonatal period. Using a mouse model of MPS-I, we demonstrated that the combination therapy improved clinical manifestations in organs usually refractory to current treatment. Moreover, combination with HSCT prevented the production of anti-IDUA antibodies that negatively impact ERT efficacy. The added benefits of combining both treatments also resulted in a reduction of skeletal anomalies and a trend towards decreased neuroinflammation and metabolic abnormalities. As currently there are limited therapeutic options for MPS-I patients, our findings suggest that the combination of HSCT and ERT during the neonatal period may provide a further step forward in the treatment of this rare disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the standard of care for Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Hurler variant [MPSIH]). However, this treatment is only partially curative and is associated with complications. METHODS: We are conducting an ongoing study involving eight children with MPSIH. At enrollment, the children lacked a suitable allogeneic donor and had a Developmental Quotient or Intelligence Quotient score above 70 (i.e., none had moderate or severe cognitive impairment). The children received autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with an alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)-encoding lentiviral vector after myeloablative conditioning. Safety and correction of blood IDUA activity up to supraphysiologic levels were the primary end points. Clearance of lysosomal storage material as well as skeletal and neurophysiological development were assessed as secondary and exploratory end points. The planned duration of the study is 5 years. RESULTS: We now report interim results. The children's mean (+-SD) age at the time of HSPC gene therapy was 1.9+-0.5 years. At a median follow-up of 2.10 years, the procedure had a safety profile similar to that known for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All the patients showed prompt and sustained engraftment of gene-corrected cells and had supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity within a month, which was maintained up to the latest follow-up. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion decreased steeply, reaching normal levels at 12 months in four of five patients who could be evaluated. Previously undetectable levels of IDUA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid became detectable after gene therapy and were associated with local clearance of GAGs. Patients showed stable cognitive performance, stable motor skills corresponding to continued motor development, improved or stable findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, reduced joint stiffness, and normal growth in line with World Health Organization growth charts. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of HSPC gene therapy in patients with MPSIH resulted in extensive metabolic correction in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system.

However, these studies can be complicated by exaggerated immune responses against the human transgene. Here we demonstrate that dogs with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), a model of the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), can be rendered immunologically tolerant to human IDUA through neonatal exposure to the enzyme. Using MPS I dogs tolerized to human IDUA as neonates, we evaluated intrathecal delivery of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector expressing human IDUA as a therapy for the central nervous system manifestations of MPS I. These studies established the efficacy of the human vector in the canine model, and allowed for estimation of the minimum effective dose, providing key information for the design of first-in-human trials. This approach can facilitate evaluation of human therapeutics in relevant animal models, and may also have clinical applications for the prevention of immune responses to gene and protein replacement therapies.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.",

The concentration of the GAG derived biomarkers heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), may reflect residual disease and is used for monitoring biochemical response to therapies. This study investigates the response of HS and DS in blood and urine to HCT in MPS I patients. METHODS: In 143 blood- and urine samples of 17 neuronophatic MPS I patients, collected prior and post successful HCT, the concentration of the disaccharides derived after full enzymatic digestion of HS and DS were analyzed by multiplex liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Median follow up after HCT was 2.4years (range 0-11years). HCT led to a rapid decrease of both HS and DS. However, only 38% of the patients reached normal HS levels in blood and even less patients (6%) reached normal DS levels. In none of the patients normalization of HS or DS was observed in urine. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker response after HCT is incomplete, which may reflect residual disease activity. Novel therapeutic strategies should aim for full metabolic correction to minimize clinical manifestations.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I (also known as Hurler syndrome) is a rare devasting recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of an enzyme. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the standard of care in the United States, usually conducted before the child is 3 years of age, but little is known about the continued medical and educational needs of the child after transplant. A greater understanding of the burden of illness on the primary caregiver is also needed. Therefore, this online survey sought to gather information on the burden of severe MPS I in the United States at least 1 year after transplant. RESULTS: Thirty-two respondents reported that children with severe MPS I have significant medical and educational needs after transplant. Healthcare resource use was frequent, especially in the outpatient setting specifically for bone, cardiac, and vision complications that were not relieved by HSCT. Twenty-five percent of the children had been hospitalized at least once in the last year and two had been hospitalized twice. The most common reasons for overnight hospitalizations included orthopedic surgeries and respiratory infections. Among children ages 5 and older, only 3 of 28 (11%) were able to attend school with no special support. While caregivers were generally satisfied with the healthcare services their child receives, 69% of working caregivers reported negative impact on their ability to conduct work tasks, and 54% of caregivers did not work so that they could care for the child. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that severe MPS I children continue to  require medical care and special support for education. Future research on the burden of illness on families affected by severe MPS I is needed to better understand total cost of care, and to identify therapies and interventions that reduce burden of illness. Future studies that compare cost of and access to health care in different countries may provide a more global view of the burden of MPS I.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is very common in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the preferred treatment for patients with severe MPS I diagnosed early in life. The protective effect of HSCT on the development of long term OSAS is not known. METHODS: Overnight polysomnography (PSG) and biomarker data were analyzed during the annual follow-up in consecutive MPS I patients treated with HSCT. RESULTS: The data of 13 patients (6 boys) were analyzed. Median age at HSCT was 17 (range 14-19) months, median age at PSG was 9.0 (4.5-14.5) years, and median time elapsed since HSCT was 7.6 (2.4-13.2) years. A significant correlation was observed between time elapsed since HSCT and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r(2)=0.493, p=+0.003) and the oxygen desaturation index (r(2)=0.424, p=+0.02). Patients older than 10 years of age had a higher mean AHI (25.8/h vs 1.4/h, p=0.0008), a lower mean pulse oximetry (94.7% vs 97.2%, p=0.01) and a higher mean hypopnea index (18.8 vs 0.71/h, p=0.016) as compared to those younger than 10 years of age. No correlation was observed between the AHI and the metabolic clearance, assessed by urine glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion and residual enzyme activity, although there was a positive trend for the urinary GAG/higher normal value for age ratio (p=0.09). CONCLUSION: HSCT does not offer long term protection against OSAS in MPS I with OSAS being documented in all patients after a time elapse since HSCT exceeding 10 years. The potential benefit of additional enzyme replacement therapy needs to be assessed.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPSI-H) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe physical symptoms and cognitive decline. Early treatment with hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) is critical to the survival of these patients. While survival rates and short-term outcomes are known to be improved by HSCT, the long-term cognitive, adaptive and psychosocial functional outcomes of children with (MPSI-H) post-HSCT are not well documented. This manuscript focuses on retrospective long-term follow-up (7-33 years) of 25 MPSI-H patients, transplanted between 1986 and 2011. RESULTS: The median age at transplantation was 21 months (range 12-57 months). Except for one death, all successfully transplanted MPSI-H patients surviving at least 1 year after HSCT are alive to-date, with a median age of 21 years (range 8-36 years) at the last follow-up evaluation. A majority of HSCT grafts were bone marrow transplants (BMT), resulting in durable full chimerism in 18 (72%). Pre-HSCT, the onset of first symptoms occurred very early, at a median age of 3 months (range birth-16 months). The most prevalent symptoms before MPSI-H diagnosis involved progressive dysostosis multiplex; almost all patients suffered from hip dysplasia and thoracolumbar spine Kyphosis. Despite HSCT, considerable residual disease burden and ensuing corrective surgical interventions were observed in all, and at every decade of follow-up post HSCT. Late-onset psychiatric manifestations were significant (n = 17 patients; 68%), including depression in 13 patients at a median onset age of 18 years (range 13-31 years), hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder (n = 4), and multiple acute psychotic episodes (APE), independent of depression observed (n = 3) at a median onset age of 18 years (range 17-31 years). The adult Welscher Intelligence Scale results (n = 16) were heterogenous across the four scale dimensions; overall lower scores were observed on both working memory index (median WMI = 69.5) and processing speed index (median PSI = 65), whereas verbal comprehension index (median VCI = 79) and perceptual reasoning index (median PRI = 74) were higher. CONCLUSION: With advanced treatment options, MPSI-H are living into 3rd and 4th decades of life, however not disease free and with poor adaptation.

Despite the recognizable morphological and behavioral deficits associated with MPS I, neither the underlying alterations in functional neural connectivity nor its restoration following gene therapy have been shown. By employing high-resolution resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we found significant reductions in functional neural connectivity in the limbic areas of the brain that play key roles in learning and memory in MPS I mice, and that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy can reestablish most brain connectivity.

One of the hallmarks of dysostosis multiplex in MPS I-H is hip dysplasia, which often requires surgical intervention. We sought to describe in detail the course of hip dysplasia in this group of patients, as assessed by radiographic analysis, and to identify potential outcome predictors. METHODS: Longitudinal data were obtained from digitally scored pelvic radiographs of patients with MPS I-H using OrthoGon software for parameters including, but not limited to, the acetabular index, migration percentage, Smith ratio, and neck-shaft angle. Scoring was performed independently by two blinded observers. Additional information on genotype, enzyme replacement therapy pre-HSCT, donor chimerism, and enzyme activity post-HSCT were obtained. General trends and potential correlations were calculated with mixed-model statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (192 radiographs) were included in this analysis. Intraobserver and interobserver variation analysis showed an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.78 to 1.00. Among the twenty-one patients with follow-up beyond the age of five years, the acetabular index was in the range of severe hip dysplasia in up to 86% of the patients. Severe coxa valga was seen in 91% of the patients. Lateral and superior femoral displacement were highly prevalent, with the migration percentage outside the reference range in up to 96% of the patients. Finally, anterior pelvic tilt increased with age (p = 0.001). No correlations were identified between clinical parameters and radiographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that progressive acetabular dysplasia as well as coxa valga and hip displacement are highly prevalent and progressive over time in patients with MPS I-H, despite successful HSCT. These data may provide essential natural history determinations for the assessment of efficacy of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving skeletal outcomes in patients with MPS I-H.",

The concentration of the GAG derived biomarkers heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), may reflect residual disease and is used for monitoring biochemical response to therapies. This study investigates the response of HS and DS in blood and urine to HCT in MPS I patients. METHODS: In 143 blood- and urine samples of 17 neuronophatic MPS I patients, collected prior and post successful HCT, the concentration of the disaccharides derived after full enzymatic digestion of HS and DS were analyzed by multiplex liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Median follow up after HCT was 2.4years (range 0-11years). HCT led to a rapid decrease of both HS and DS. However, only 38% of the patients reached normal HS levels in blood and even less patients (6%) reached normal DS levels. In none of the patients normalization of HS or DS was observed in urine. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker response after HCT is incomplete, which may reflect residual disease activity.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "During brain maturation, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), a key transporter for lysosomal hydrolases, decreases significantly on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Such a phenomenon leads to poor brain penetration of therapeutic enzymes and subsequent failure in reversing neurological complications in patients with neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases (nLSDs), such as Hurler syndrome (severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I [MPS I]). In this study, we discover that upregulation of microRNA-143 (miR-143) contributes to the decline of CI-MPR on the BBB during development. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-143 inhibits CI-MPR expression and its transport function in human endothelial cells in vitro. Genetic removal of miR-143 in MPS I mice enhances CI-MPR expression and improves enzyme transport across the BBB, leading to brain metabolic correction, pathology normalization, and correction of neurological functional deficits 5 months after peripheral protein delivery at clinically relevant levels that derived from erythroid/megakaryocytic cells via hematopoietic stem cell-mediated gene therapy, when otherwise no improvement was observed in MPS I mice at a parallel setting. These studies not only uncover a novel role of miR-143 as an important modulator for the developmental decline of CI-MPR on the BBB, but they also demonstrate the functional significance of depleting miR-143 for \"rescuing\" BBB-anchored CI-MPR on advancing CNS treatment for nLSDs.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.",

                    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that seriously affects the brain. Severity of neurocognitive symptoms in attenuated MPS subtype (MPS IA) broadly varies partially, due to restricted permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) which limits treatment effects of intravenously applied alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) enzyme. Intrathecal (IT) rhIDU application as a possible solution to circumvent BBB improved brain outcomes in canine models; therefore, our study quantifies effects of IT rhIDU on brain structure and function in an MPS IA patient with previous progressive cognitive decline. Neuropsychological testing and MRIs were performed twice prior (baseline, at 1 year) and twice after initiating IT rhIDU (at 2nd and 3rd years). The difference between pre- and post-treatment means was evaluated as a percentage of the change. Neurocognitive performance improved particularly in memory tests and resulted in improved school performance after IT rhIDU treatment. White matter (WM) integrity improved together with an increase of WM and corpus callosum volumes. Hippocampal and gray matter volume decreased which may either parallel reduction of glycosaminoglycan storage or reflect typical longitudinal brain changes in early adulthood. In conclusion, our outcomes suggest neurological benefits of IT rhIDU compared to the intravenous administration on brain structure and function in a single MPS IA patient.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: This institutional study reviewed 15 corneas from 9 patients with MPS I spectrum disease who underwent corneal transplant to treat corneal clouding between May 2011 and October 2020. We reviewed the clinical data, hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, and histochemical stains, including those for mucopolysaccharides (Alcian blue and/or colloidal iron). The main outcome measures were pathology observed under light microscopy and postsurgical clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent 15 corneal transplants for corneal clouding (14/15 procedures were deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty). All corneas had mucopolysaccharide deposition visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, which was highlighted in blue with histochemical stains. All corneas also showed alterations in Bowman's layer and the majority also showed epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSION: MPS I shows significant corneal clouding that is successfully treated with deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The excised corneas show characteristic epithelial changes, disruption or breaks in Bowman's membrane, and amphophilic collections of stromal granular mucopolysaccharides which are visible on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and highlighted by special histochemical stains (Alcian blue and collodial iron). These changes, although subtle, should alert the pathologist to the possibility of an underlying lysosomal storage disorder.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The introduction of stem cell transplantation has improved life expectancy and cognitive outcome in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, but this condition remains associated with substantial residual disease in several parts of the body. Many patients have hip dysplasia with progressive medial flattening of the femoral head. Quantitative evidence on the effect of surgery on remodeling to sphericity of flattened femoral heads is lacking. In the present study, we used statistical shape modeling to quantify the effect of hip surgery on the sphericity of the femoral head in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case control study involving a series of 23 patients with hip dysplasia due to mucopolysaccharidosis I. Surgery was not offered to the first 11 children (control group). Following a change in treatment protocol, the next 12 children underwent bilateral proximal femoral varus derotation osteotomy and Pemberton osteotomy for the treatment of acetabular dysplasia with progressive femoral head flattening (surgery group). The surgery and control groups were compared with a reference group of patients with normal hips. Statistical shape modeling was used to quantify the shape of the femoral head (i.e., flattening and/or roundness of the epiphysis). RESULTS: The mean age at the time of stem cell transplantation in the surgery and control groups was comparable (1.2 years). The mean age at the time of surgical intervention was 5.5 years, and mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 3.3 years. Statistical shape modeling showed variations within the total group in terms of medial indentation, width, height, and sphericity of the femoral heads. In contrast to the progressive femoral head flattening in the control group, the surgery group showed improvement of the sphericity of the femoral head after surgery. The overall shape characteristics of the femoral head in the surgery group were similar to those of the reference group of patients with normal hips. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I that has shown quantitative remodeling of the dysplastic, flattened femoral head to normal sphericity after increasing containment of the femoral head.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately, there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements. RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than is obtaining serial imaging.",

Amongst these enzymopathies, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), ultimately causes toxic build-up of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). There is currently no cure and standard treatments provide insufficient relief to the skeletal structure and central nervous system (CNS). Human memory T cells (Tm) migrate throughout the body's tissues and can persist for years, making them an attractive approach for cellular-based, systemic enzyme replacement therapy. Here, we tested genetically engineered, IDUA-expressing Tm as a cellular therapy in an immunodeficient mouse model of MPS I. Our results demonstrate that a single dose of engineered Tm leads to detectable IDUA enzyme levels in the blood for up to 22 weeks and reduced urinary GAG excretion. Furthermore, engineered Tm take up residence in nearly all tested tissues, producing IDUA and leading to metabolic correction of GAG levels in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bone marrow, and the CNS, though only minimal improved cognition was observed. Our study indicates that genetically engineered Tm holds great promise as a platform for cellular-based enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I and potentially many other enzymopathies and protein deficiencies.",

Many vectors have difficulties with efficacy and insertional mutagenesis concerns including adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Studies of AAV vectors treating MPS I have seemed promising, but recent deaths in gene therapy clinical trials for other inherited diseases using AAV vectors have left questions about their safety. Additionally, the recent modifications to adenoviral vectors leading them to target the vascular endothelium minimizing the risk of hepatotoxicity could lead to them being a viable option for MPS I gene therapy when coupled with gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type I (MPSI) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), and a majority of patients present with severe neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Recombinant IDUA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enable BBB transport, IDUA was re-engineered as an IgG-IDUA fusion protein, valanafusp alpha, where the IgG domain targets the BBB human insulin receptor to enable transport of the enzyme into the brain. We report the results of a 52-week clinical trial on the safety and efficacy of valanafusp alpha in pediatric MPSI patients with cognitive impairment. In the phase I trial, 6 adults with attenuated MPSI were administered 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg doses of valanafusp alpha by intravenous (IV) infusion. In the phase II trial, 11 pediatric subjects, 2-15 years of age, were treated for 52 weeks with weekly IV infusions of valanafusp alpha at 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg. Assessments of adverse events, cognitive stabilization, and somatic stabilization were made. Outcomes at 52 weeks were compared to baseline. RESULTS: Drug related adverse events included infusion related reactions, with an incidence of 1.7%, and transient hypoglycemia, with an incidence of 6.4%. The pediatric subjects had CNS involvement with a mean enrollment Development Quotient (DQ) of 36.1+-7.1. The DQ, and the cortical grey matter volume of brain, were stabilized by valanafusp alpha treatment. Somatic manifestations were stabilized, or improved, based on urinary glycosaminoglycan levels, hepatic and spleen volumes, and shoulder range of motion. CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence of the cognitive and somatic stabilization indicates that valanafusp alpha is transported into both the CNS and into peripheral organs due to its dual targeting mechanism via the insulin receptor and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor.

Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis. RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.",

However, this treatment is only partially curative and is associated with complications. METHODS: We are conducting an ongoing study involving eight children with MPSIH. At enrollment, the children lacked a suitable allogeneic donor and had a Developmental Quotient or Intelligence Quotient score above 70 (i.e., none had moderate or severe cognitive impairment). The children received autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with an alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)-encoding lentiviral vector after myeloablative conditioning. Safety and correction of blood IDUA activity up to supraphysiologic levels were the primary end points. Clearance of lysosomal storage material as well as skeletal and neurophysiological development were assessed as secondary and exploratory end points. The planned duration of the study is 5 years. RESULTS: We now report interim results. The children's mean (+-SD) age at the time of HSPC gene therapy was 1.9+-0.5 years. At a median follow-up of 2.10 years, the procedure had a safety profile similar to that known for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All the patients showed prompt and sustained engraftment of gene-corrected cells and had supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity within a month, which was maintained up to the latest follow-up. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion decreased steeply, reaching normal levels at 12 months in four of five patients who could be evaluated. Previously undetectable levels of IDUA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid became detectable after gene therapy and were associated with local clearance of GAGs. Patients showed stable cognitive performance, stable motor skills corresponding to continued motor development, improved or stable findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, reduced joint stiffness, and normal growth in line with World Health Organization growth charts. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of HSPC gene therapy in patients with MPSIH resulted in extensive metabolic correction in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system.
