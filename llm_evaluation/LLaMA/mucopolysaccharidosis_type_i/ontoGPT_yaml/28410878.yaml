input_text: 'Efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I who initiated enzyme replacement therapy in adult age. A systematic review
  and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of starting enzyme replacement therapy
  (ERT) in adults with Muchopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS-I) is controversial. Evaluating
  the benefits reported by patients initiating ERT with laronidase at adult age might
  help physicians decide whether the use of ERT in these patients is worthwhile from
  a clinical point of view. OBJECTIVE: To assess every effectiveness variable modified
  in MPS-I patients who initiated laronidase at adult age. METHODS: A systematic search
  of the literature, from inception to July 2016, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE,
  CENTRAL and LILACS to identify randomized trials or observational studies including
  >=1 MPS-I patients with ERT initiated in adult age (>=18years) and evaluating ERT
  efficacy. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating the same effectiveness outcome was
  performed and the evidence was rated according to GRADE criteria. Heterogeneity
  was assessed by the Chi-squared test and the I-squared statistic. Case reports were
  excluded from meta-analysis but their main outcomes were separately evaluated. The
  decrease in urine glycosaminoglycans (uGAGs) levels as patient percentage with reduction
  in uGAGs and with normalization was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical
  studies and 12 case reports were selected. ERT decreased uGAG levels (high evidence)
  and liver volume (high), improved 6-min walking test (6MWT) (moderate) and increased
  blood anti-ERT antibody levels (high). There was no conclusive results (low or very
  low evidence) regarding improvement/stabilization of respiratory function, change
  in shoulder flexion, cardiac improvement/stabilization, improvement in symptoms
  of nocturnal hypoventilation and sleep apnea, improvement in quality of life, visual
  acuity, otolaryngologic function, bone mineral density or effectiveness of intrathecal
  therapy. LIMITATIONS: Excluding case reports, there was no study conducted specifically
  in the target population (ERT >=18years). Data were from subgroup analyses of selected
  studies. There was a great heterogeneity between designs and clinical outcomes evaluated.
  CONCLUSIONS: ERT improves uGAGs and liver volume in MPS-I patients initiating therapy
  as adults, although the putative clinical benefit associated to these improvements
  is unclear. Moderate evidence was shown for improvement in 6MWT. Systematic review
  registration number (PROSPERO): 42,016,041,306.'
