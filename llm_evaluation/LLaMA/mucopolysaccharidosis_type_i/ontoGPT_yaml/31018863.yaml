input_text: 'Hurler-Scheie syndrome in Niger: a case series. BACKGROUND: Hurler-Scheie
  syndrome is an intermediate form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I which is a rare
  lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency or complete absence of enzyme
  alpha-L-iduronidase activity. We report the first documented cases of Hurler-Scheie
  syndrome observed in Niger in a Touareg family. CASE PRESENTATION: We studied the
  case of two 12-year-old twin Touareg boys and their 10-year-old Touareg sister whose
  parents are first-degree cousins, and there was no history of similar cases in their
  previous generations. The diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie syndrome was considered in
  these patients on the basis of clinical and radiological arguments, with the highlighting
  of a deficiency of enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase in serum and leukocytes. The twins
  had presented the first symptoms at the age of 24 months and the diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie
  syndrome was made at the age of 12 years. In their younger sister, the first symptoms
  were observed at the age of 3 years and the diagnosis was made at the age of 10
  years. The three probands were born after a normal full-term pregnancy and a spontaneous
  vaginal delivery according to their parents. Their birth weight, height, and head
  circumference were within normal limits according to their parents. The three probands
  were brought in for consultation for stunted growth, joint stiffness with gait disorders,
  deformities of the thoracolumbar spine, recurrent otitis media, decreased hearing,
  increased abdominal volume, snoring during sleep, and facial dysmorphism. CONCLUSIONS:
  Even in countries with limited access to diagnostic means, a good knowledge of the
  clinical manifestations of the disease can help to guide the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I.'
