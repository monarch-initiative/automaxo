input_text: miR-143 Regulates Lysosomal Enzyme Transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier
  and Transforms CNS Treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I. During brain maturation,
  cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), a key transporter for
  lysosomal hydrolases, decreases significantly on the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
  Such a phenomenon leads to poor brain penetration of therapeutic enzymes and subsequent
  failure in reversing neurological complications in patients with neuropathic lysosomal
  storage diseases (nLSDs), such as Hurler syndrome (severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I [MPS I]). In this study, we discover that upregulation of microRNA-143 (miR-143)
  contributes to the decline of CI-MPR on the BBB during development. Gain- and loss-of-function
  studies showed that miR-143 inhibits CI-MPR expression and its transport function
  in human endothelial cells in vitro. Genetic removal of miR-143 in MPS I mice enhances
  CI-MPR expression and improves enzyme transport across the BBB, leading to brain
  metabolic correction, pathology normalization, and correction of neurological functional
  deficits 5 months after peripheral protein delivery at clinically relevant levels
  that derived from erythroid/megakaryocytic cells via hematopoietic stem cell-mediated
  gene therapy, when otherwise no improvement was observed in MPS I mice at a parallel
  setting. These studies not only uncover a novel role of miR-143 as an important
  modulator for the developmental decline of CI-MPR on the BBB, but they also demonstrate
  the functional significance of depleting miR-143 for "rescuing" BBB-anchored CI-MPR
  on advancing CNS treatment for nLSDs.
