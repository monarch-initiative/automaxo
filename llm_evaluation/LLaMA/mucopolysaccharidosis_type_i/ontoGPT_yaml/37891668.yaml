input_text: "Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous
  enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond. BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency
  (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home
  therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This
  research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance
  of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme ) and Pompe Disease patients
  treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme ) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report
  herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a
  multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed
  38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort
  B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before
  enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort
  A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective
  of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of
  patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main
  reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%).
  Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as
  \"good\" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety
  profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use
  of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
