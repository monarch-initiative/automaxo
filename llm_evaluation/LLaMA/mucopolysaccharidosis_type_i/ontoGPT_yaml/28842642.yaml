input_text: Neonatal umbilical cord blood transplantation halts skeletal disease progression
  in the murine model of MPS-I. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a promising source of
  stem cells to use in early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) approaches
  for several genetic diseases that can be diagnosed at birth. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS-I) is a progressive multi-system disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal
  enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, and patients treated with allogeneic HSCT at the onset
  have improved outcome, suggesting to administer such therapy as early as possible.
  Given that the best characterized MPS-I murine model is an immunocompetent mouse,
  we here developed a transplantation system based on murine UCB. With the final aim
  of testing the therapeutic efficacy of UCB in MPS-I mice transplanted at birth,
  we first defined the features of murine UCB cells and demonstrated that they are
  capable of multi-lineage haematopoietic repopulation of myeloablated adult mice
  similarly to bone marrow cells. We then assessed the effectiveness of murine UCB
  cells transplantation in busulfan-conditioned newborn MPS-I mice. Twenty weeks after
  treatment, iduronidase activity was increased in visceral organs of MPS-I animals,
  glycosaminoglycans storage was reduced, and skeletal phenotype was ameliorated.
  This study explores a potential therapy for MPS-I at a very early stage in life
  and represents a novel model to test UCB-based transplantation approaches for various
  diseases.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS).
