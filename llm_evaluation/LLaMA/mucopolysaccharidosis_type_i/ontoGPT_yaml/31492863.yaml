input_text: Human genome-edited hematopoietic stem cells phenotypically correct Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I. Lysosomal enzyme deficiencies comprise a large group of genetic disorders
  that generally lack effective treatments. A potential treatment approach is to engineer
  the patient's own hematopoietic system to express high levels of the deficient enzyme,
  thereby correcting the biochemical defect and halting disease progression. Here,
  we present an efficient ex vivo genome editing approach using CRISPR-Cas9 that targets
  the lysosomal enzyme iduronidase to the CCR5 safe harbor locus in human CD34+ hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells. The modified cells secrete supra-endogenous enzyme levels,
  maintain long-term repopulation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and
  can improve biochemical and phenotypic abnormalities in an immunocompromised mouse
  model of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. These studies provide support for the development
  of genome-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a potential treatment
  for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The safe harbor approach constitutes a flexible
  platform for the expression of lysosomal enzymes making it applicable to other lysosomal
  storage disorders.
