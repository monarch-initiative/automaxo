input_text: 'Subcutaneous implantation of microencapsulated cells overexpressing alpha-L-iduronidase
  for mucopolysaccharidosis type I treatment. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)
  is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), resulting in accumulation
  of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in lysosomes. Microencapsulation of recombinant cells
  is a promising gene/cell therapy approach that could overcome the limitations of
  the current available treatments. In the present study we produced alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate
  (APA) microcapsules containing recombinant cells overexpressing IDUA, which were
  implanted in the subcutaneous space of MPS I mice in order to evaluate their potential
  effect as a treatment for this disease. APA microcapsules enclosing genetically
  modified Baby Hamster Kidney cells overexpressing IDUA were produced and implanted
  in the subcutaneous space of 4-month-old MPS I mice (Idua -/-). Treatment was performed
  using two cell concentrations: 8.3 x 107 and 8.3 x 106 cells/mL. Untreated MPS I
  and normal mice were used as controls. Microcapsules were retrieved and analyzed
  after treatment. Increased IDUA in the liver, kidney and heart was detected 24 h
  postimplantation. After 120 days, higher IDUA activity was detected in the liver,
  kidney and heart, in both groups, whereas GAG accumulation was reduced only in the
  high cell concentration group. Microcapsules analysis showed blood vessels around
  them, as well as inflammatory cells and a fibrotic layer. Microencapsulated cells
  were able to ameliorate some aspects of the disease, indicating their potential
  as a treatment. To achieve better performance of the microcapsules, improvements
  such as the modulation of inflammatory response are suggested.'
