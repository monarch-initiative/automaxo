  leukodystrophy and mucopolysaccaridosis I. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are
  rare inherited metabolic disorders characterized by a dysfunction in lysosomes,
  leading to waste material accumulation and severe organ damage. Enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have been exploited
  as potential treatments for LSDs but pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown
  in some cases limited efficacy. Intravenous ERT is able to control the damage of
  visceral organs but cannot prevent nervous impairment. Depending on the disease
  type, HSCT has important limitations when performed for early variants, unless treatment
  occurs before disease onset. In the attempt to overcome these issues, gene therapy
  has been proposed as a valuable therapeutic option, either ex vivo, with target
  cells genetically modified in vitro, or in vivo, by inserting the genetic material
  with systemic or intra-parenchymal, in situ administration. In particular, the use
  of autologous haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced with a viral vector containing
  a healthy copy of the mutated gene would allow supra-normal production of the defective
  enzyme and cross correction of target cells in multiple tissues, including the central
  nervous system. This review will provide an overview of the most recent scientific
  advances in HSC-based gene therapy approaches for the treatment of LSDs with particular
  focus on metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I).'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS).
