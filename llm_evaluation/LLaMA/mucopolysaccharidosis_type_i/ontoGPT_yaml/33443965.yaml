input_text: 'Quantifying the Effects of Hip Surgery on the Sphericity of the Femoral
  Head in Patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I. BACKGROUND: The introduction
  of stem cell transplantation has improved life expectancy and cognitive outcome
  in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, but this condition remains associated
  with substantial residual disease in several parts of the body. Many patients have
  hip dysplasia with progressive medial flattening of the femoral head. Quantitative
  evidence on the effect of surgery on remodeling to sphericity of flattened femoral
  heads is lacking. In the present study, we used statistical shape modeling to quantify
  the effect of hip surgery on the sphericity of the femoral head in patients with
  mucopolysaccharidosis I. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case control study
  involving a series of 23 patients with hip dysplasia due to mucopolysaccharidosis
  I. Surgery was not offered to the first 11 children (control group). Following a
  change in treatment protocol, the next 12 children underwent bilateral proximal
  femoral varus derotation osteotomy and Pemberton osteotomy for the treatment of
  acetabular dysplasia with progressive femoral head flattening (surgery group). The
  surgery and control groups were compared with a reference group of patients with
  normal hips. Statistical shape modeling was used to quantify the shape of the femoral
  head (i.e., flattening and/or roundness of the epiphysis). RESULTS: The mean age
  at the time of stem cell transplantation in the surgery and control groups was comparable
  (1.2 years). The mean age at the time of surgical intervention was 5.5 years, and
  mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 3.3 years. Statistical shape modeling
  showed variations within the total group in terms of medial indentation, width,
  height, and sphericity of the femoral heads. In contrast to the progressive femoral
  head flattening in the control group, the surgery group showed improvement of the
  sphericity of the femoral head after surgery. The overall shape characteristics
  of the femoral head in the surgery group were similar to those of the reference
  group of patients with normal hips. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first
  study in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I that has shown quantitative remodeling
  of the dysplastic, flattened femoral head to normal sphericity after increasing
  containment of the femoral head. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions
  for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.'
