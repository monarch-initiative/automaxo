input_text: '12 year follow up of enzyme-replacement therapy in two siblings with
  attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis I: the important role of early treatment. BACKGROUND:
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency
  of alpha-L-iduronidase and characterized by a progressive course with multisystem
  involvement. Clinically, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is classified into two forms:
  severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid
  progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes),
  which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement.
  The specific treatment for attenuated Mucopolysaccharidosis type I consists of enzyme-replacement
  therapy with laronidase (human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We
  present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12-year-old patient affected
  by the attenuated form of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I treated by enzyme-replacement
  therapy from the age of 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister,
  who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of
  these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically
  detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young
  sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear
  growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint
  disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared
  with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis
  and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural
  history of the attenuated form of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS).
