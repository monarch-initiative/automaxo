input_text: TALEN-mediated intron editing of HSPCs enables transgene expression restricted
  to the myeloid lineage. Gene therapy in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
  (HSPCs) shows great potential for the treatment of inborn metabolic diseases. Typical
  HSPC gene therapy approaches rely on constitutive promoters to express a therapeutic
  transgene, which is associated with multiple disadvantages. Here, we propose a novel
  promoter-less intronic gene editing approach that triggers transgene expression
  only after cellular differentiation into the myeloid lineage. We integrated a splicing-competent
  eGFP cassette into the first intron of CD11b and observed expression of eGFP in
  the myeloid lineage but minimal to no expression in HSPCs or differentiated non-myeloid
  lineages. In vivo, edited HSPCs successfully engrafted in immunodeficient mice and
  displayed transgene expression in the myeloid compartment of multiple tissues. Using
  the same approach, we expressed alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), the defective enzyme
  in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and observed a 10-fold supraendogenous IDUA expression
  exclusively after myeloid differentiation. Edited cells efficiently populated bone
  marrow, blood, and spleen of immunodeficient mice, and retained the capacity to
  secrete IDUA ex vivo. Importantly, cells edited with the eGFP and IDUA transgenes
  were also found in the brain. This approach may unlock new therapeutic strategies
  for inborn metabolic and neurological diseases that require the delivery of therapeutics
  in brain.
