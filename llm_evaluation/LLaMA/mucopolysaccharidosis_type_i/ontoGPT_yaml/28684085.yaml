input_text: 'Incomplete biomarker response in mucopolysaccharidosis type I after successful
  hematopoietic cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Residual disease, primarily involving
  musculoskeletal tissue, is a common problem in patients with neuronopathic mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I, Hurler or severe Hurler-Scheie phenotype) after a successful hematopoietic
  cell transplantation (HCT). The concentration of the GAG derived biomarkers heparan
  sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), may reflect residual disease and is used
  for monitoring biochemical response to therapies. This study investigates the response
  of HS and DS in blood and urine to HCT in MPS I patients. METHODS: In 143 blood-
  and urine samples of 17 neuronophatic MPS I patients, collected prior and post successful
  HCT, the concentration of the disaccharides derived after full enzymatic digestion
  of HS and DS were analyzed by multiplex liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Median follow up after HCT was 2.4years (range 0-11years).
  HCT led to a rapid decrease of both HS and DS. However, only 38% of the patients
  reached normal HS levels in blood and even less patients (6%) reached normal DS
  levels. In none of the patients normalization of HS or DS was observed in urine.
  CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker response after HCT is incomplete, which may reflect residual
  disease activity. Novel therapeutic strategies should aim for full metabolic correction
  to minimize clinical manifestations.'
