input_text: 'A Highly Efficacious PS Gene Editing System Corrects Metabolic and Neurological
  Complications of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I. Our previous study delivered zinc
  finger nucleases to treat mice with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), resulting
  in a phase I/II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02702115). However, in the
  clinical trial, the efficacy needs to be improved due to the low transgene expression
  level. To this end, we designed a proprietary system (PS) gene editing approach
  with CRISPR to insert a promoterless alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) cDNA sequence into
  the albumin locus of hepatocytes. In this study, adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8)
  vectors delivering the PS gene editing system were injected into neonatal and adult
  MPS I mice. IDUA enzyme activity in the brain significantly increased, while storage
  levels were normalized. Neurobehavioral tests showed that treated mice had better
  memory and learning ability. Also, histological analysis showed efficacy reflected
  by the absence of foam cells in the liver and vacuolation in neuronal cells. No
  vector-associated toxicity or increased tumorigenesis risk was observed. Moreover,
  no off-target effects were detected through the unbiased genome-wide unbiased identification
  of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) analysis. In summary,
  these results showed the safety and efficacy of the PS in treating MPS I and paved
  the way for clinical studies. Additionally, as a therapeutic platform, the PS has
  the potential to treat other lysosomal diseases.'
