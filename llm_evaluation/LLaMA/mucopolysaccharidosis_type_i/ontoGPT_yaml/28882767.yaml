input_text: Optimization of alginate microcapsules containing cells overexpressing
  alpha-l-iduronidase using Box-Behnken design. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of alpha-l-iduronidase
  (IDUA), which results in the lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG)
  leading to widespread clinical manifestations. The microencapsulation of IDUA overexpressing
  recombinant cells has been considered as a promising strategy for the treatment
  of MPS I. This study aimed at the optimization of alginate microcapsules containing
  recombinant BHK (Baby Hamster Kidney) cells (rBHK) overexpressing IDUA produced
  by electrostatic extrusion technique. The alginate microcapsule (MC-A) optimization
  study was carried out by means of an experimental Box-Behnken Design that allowed
  the simultaneous evaluation of the influence of voltage (kV), alginate/cell suspension
  flow (mL/h), and alginate concentration (%) on size and IDUA activity. The optimal
  conditions of voltage (10kV), flow (25mL/h), and alginate concentration (1.3%) made
  possible to obtain the smallest microcapsules showing the highest IDUA activity.
  After optimization, the microcapsules were sequentially coated with PLL and alginate
  (MC-APA) to increase their stability. MC-A and MC-APA presented monodisperse populations
  (span<1.22) with an average diameter of less than 350mum. The coating increased
  the mechanical stability of MC-APA by about 6-fold and modulated the permeability
  to the enzyme. Surface analyzes of MC-APA showed the presence of PLL bands, suggesting
  that the last alginate layer appears to have only partially coated the PLL. After
  30days of subcutaneous implantation of the MC-APA microcapsules containing rBHK
  cells in a MPS I murine model, a significant increase in IDUA activity was observed
  in the skin near the implant. Histological analysis revealed an inflammatory infiltrate
  at the application site, which did not prevent the release of the enzyme under the
  conditions evaluated. Taken together, the overall results demonstrate the feasibility
  of MC-APA as a potential alternative for local treatment of MPS I.
