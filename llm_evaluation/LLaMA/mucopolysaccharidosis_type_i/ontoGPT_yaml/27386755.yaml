input_text: Neonatal tolerance induction enables accurate evaluation of gene therapy
  for MPS I in a canine model. High fidelity animal models of human disease are essential
  for preclinical evaluation of novel gene and protein therapeutics. However, these
  studies can be complicated by exaggerated immune responses against the human transgene.
  Here we demonstrate that dogs with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase
  (IDUA), a model of the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I), can be rendered immunologically tolerant to human IDUA through neonatal exposure
  to the enzyme. Using MPS I dogs tolerized to human IDUA as neonates, we evaluated
  intrathecal delivery of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector expressing human
  IDUA as a therapy for the central nervous system manifestations of MPS I. These
  studies established the efficacy of the human vector in the canine model, and allowed
  for estimation of the minimum effective dose, providing key information for the
  design of first-in-human trials. This approach can facilitate evaluation of human
  therapeutics in relevant animal models, and may also have clinical applications
  for the prevention of immune responses to gene and protein replacement therapies.
