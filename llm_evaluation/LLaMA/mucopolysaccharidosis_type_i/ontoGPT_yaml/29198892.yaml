input_text: RTB lectin-mediated delivery of lysosomal alpha-l-iduronidase mitigates
  disease manifestations systemically including the central nervous system. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal disease resulting from deficiency in the alpha-L-iduronidase
  (IDUA) hydrolase and subsequent accumulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Clinically,
  enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with IDUA achieves negligible neurological benefits
  presumably due to blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limitations. To investigate the plant
  lectin ricin B chain (RTB) as a novel carrier for enzyme delivery to the brain,
  an IDUA:RTB fusion protein (IDUAL), produced in N. benthamiana leaves, was tested
  in a murine model of Hurler syndrome (MPS I). Affect mice (n=3 for each group) were
  intravenously injected with a single dose of IDUAL (0.58, 2 or 5.8mgIDUAequivalents/kg)
  and analyzed after 24h. IDUA activities in liver, kidney and spleen increased significantly,
  and liver GAG levels were significantly reduced in all three groups. Plasma IDUA
  levels for all treated groups were high at 1h after injection and decreased by 95%
  at 4h, indicating efficient distribution into tissues. For long-term evaluations,
  IDUAL (0.58 or 2mg/kg, 8 weekly injections) was intravenously injected into MPS
  I mice (n=12 for each group). Thirteen days after the 8th injection, significant
  IDUA activity was detected in the liver and spleen. GAG levels in tissues including
  the brain cortex and cerebellum were significantly reduced in treated animals. Treated
  MPS I mice also showed significant improvement in neurocognitive testing. ELISA
  results showed that while there was a significant antibody response against IDUAL
  and plant-derived IDUA, there was no significant antibody response to RTB. No major
  toxicity or adverse events were observed. Together, these results showed that infusion
  of IDUAL allowed for significant IDUA levels and GAG reduction in the brain and
  subsequent neurological benefits. This RTB-mediated delivery may have significant
  implications for therapeutic protein delivery impacting a broad spectrum of lysosomal,
  and potentially neurological diseases.

  primary_disease: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)

  medical_actions: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with IDUA; infusion of IDUAL (IDUA:RTB fusion protein); intravenous injection of IDUAL

  symptoms: Accumulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG); neurological symptoms; cognitive impairment

  chemicals: alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA); ricin B chain (RTB); IDUAL (IDUA:RTB fusion protein); glycosaminoglycan (GAG)

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - IDUA TREATS accumulation of GAG IN MPS I; 
  - IDUAL TREATS accumulation of GAG IN MPS I; 
  - IDUAL TREATS neurological symptoms IN MPS I; 
  - IDUAL TREATS cognitive impairment IN MPS I; 
  - IDUA (via ERT) PREVENTS progression of MPS I; 
  - RTB-mediated delivery of IDUA TREATS MPS I 

  Note that some of these relationships can be inferred from the text, and the exact wording may vary depending on the interpretation. Also, keep in mind that I don't have access to a database or search engine to verify the accuracy of these extracted entities, so double-checking is recommended.
