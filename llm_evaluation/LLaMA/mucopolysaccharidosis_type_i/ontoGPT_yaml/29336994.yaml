input_text: 'Agreement between the results of meta-analyses from case reports and
  from clinical studies regarding the efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients with
  mucopolysaccharidosis type I who initiated enzyme replacement therapy in adult age:
  An example of case reports meta-analyses as an useful tool for evidence-based medicine
  in rare diseases. BACKGROUND: Case reports might have a prominent role in the rare
  diseases field, due to the small number of patients affected by one such disease.
  A previous systematic review regarding the efficacy of laronidase therapy in patients
  with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) who initiated enzyme replacement therapy
  (ERT) in adult age has been published. The review included a meta-analysis of 19
  clinical studies and the description of eleven case reports. It was of interest
  to perform a meta-analysis of those case reports to explore the role of such meta-analyses
  as a tool for evidence-based medicine in rare diseases. METHODS: The study included
  all case reports with standard treatment regimen. Primary analysis was the percentage
  of case reports showing an improvement in a specific outcome. Only when that percentage
  was statistically higher than 5%, the improvement was confirmed as such. The outcomes
  that accomplished this criterion were ranked and compared to the GRADE criteria
  obtained by those same outcomes in the previous meta-analysis of clinical studies.
  RESULTS: There were three outcomes that had a significant improvement: Urine glycosaminoglycans,
  liver volume and 6-minute walking test. Positive and negative predictive values,
  sensitivity and specificity for the results of the meta-analysis of case reports
  as compared to that of clinical studies were 100%, 88.9%, 75% and 100%, respectively.
  Accordingly, absolute (Rho=0.82, 95%CI: 0.47 to 0.95) and relative agreement (Kappa=0.79,
  95%CI: 0.593 to 0.99) between the number of case reports with improvement in a specific
  outcome and the GRADE evidence score for that outcome were good. Sensitivity analysis
  showed that agreement between the meta-analysis of case reports and that of the
  clinical studies were good only when using a strong confirmatory strategy for outcome
  improvement in case reports. CONCLUSIONS: We found an agreement between the results
  of meta-analyses from case reports and from clinical studies in the efficacy of
  laronidase therapy in patients with MPS-I who initiated ERT in adult age. This agreement
  suggests that combining case reports quantitatively, rather than analyzing them
  separately or qualitatively, may improve conclusions in the field of rare diseases.'
