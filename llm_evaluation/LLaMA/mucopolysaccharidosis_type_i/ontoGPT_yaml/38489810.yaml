input_text: 'Natural history of craniovertebral abnormalities in a single-center study
  in 54 patients with Hurler syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities
  are common and well documented in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome (MPS
  IH), often causing severe spinal canal narrowing. However, the requirement for surgical
  decompression and/or fusion is uncommon. Although hematopoietic cell transplant
  (HCT) has been shown to prolong the lives of patients with MPS IH, its effect in
  halting or reversing musculoskeletal abnormalities is less clear. Unfortunately,
  there are currently no universal guidelines for imaging or indication for surgical
  interventions in these patients. The goal of this study was to track the progression
  of the CVJ anatomy in patients with MPS IH following HCT, and to examine radiographic
  features in patients who needed surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients with MPS
  IH treated at the University of Minnesota with allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020
  were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent CVJ surgery were identified
  with chart review. All MPS IH cervical scans were examined, and the odontoid retroflexion
  angle, clivoaxial angle (CXA), canal width, and Grabb-Oakes distance (pB-C2) were
  measured yearly for up to 7 years after HCT. Longitudinal models based on the measurements
  were made. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure interrater
  reliability. Nine children without MPS IH were examined for control CVJ measurements.
  RESULTS: A total of 253 cervical spine MRI scans were reviewed in 54 patients with
  MPS IH. Only 4 (7.4%) patients in the study cohort required surgery. Three of them
  had posterior fossa and C1 decompression, and 1 had a C1-2 fusion. There was no
  statistically significant difference in the spinal parameters that were examined
  between surgery and nonsurgery groups. Among the measurements, canal width and CXA
  varied drastically in patients with different neck positions. Odontoid retroflexion
  angle and CXA tended to decrease with age. Canal width and pB-C2 tended to increase
  with age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, the authors observed an increase in canal
  width and pB-C2, whereas the CXA and odontoid retroflexion angle became more acute
  as the patients aged after HCT. The longitudinal models derived from these data
  mirrored the development in children without MPS IH. Spinal measurements obtained
  on MR images alone are not sufficient in identifying patients who require surgical
  intervention. Symptom monitoring and clinical examination, as well as pathological
  spinal cord changes on MRI, are more crucial in assessing the need for surgery than
  is obtaining serial imaging.'
