input_text: Nanoemulsions as Gene Delivery in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I-A Mini-Review.
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare monogenic disease in which glycosaminoglycans'
  abnormal metabolism leads to the storage of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate
  in various tissues. It causes its damage and impairment. Patients with the severe
  form of MPS I usually do not live up to the age of ten. Currently, the therapy is
  based on multidisciplinary care and enzyme replacement therapy or hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation. Applying gene therapy might benefit the MPS I patients
  because it overcomes the typical limitations of standard treatments. Nanoparticles,
  including nanoemulsions, are used more and more in medicine to deliver a particular
  drug to the target cells. It allows for creating a specific, efficient therapy method
  in MPS I and other lysosomal storage disorders. This article briefly presents the
  basics of nanoemulsions and discusses the current state of knowledge about their
  usage in mucopolysaccharidosis type I.
