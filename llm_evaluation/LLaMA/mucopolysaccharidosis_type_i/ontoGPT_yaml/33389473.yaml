input_text: 'c.1898C>G/p.Ser633Trp Mutation in Alpha-L-Iduronidase: Clinical and Structural
  Implications. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic
  disease caused by deficient activity of alpha-L-iduronidase. As a consequence of
  low or absent activity of this enzyme, glycosaminoglycans accumulate in the lysosomal
  compartments of multiple cell types throughout the body. Mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes, ranging from a severe Hurler form
  to the more attenuated Hurler-Scheie and Scheie phenotypes. Over 200 gene variants
  causing the various forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type I have been reported. DNA
  isolated from dried blood spot was used to sequencing of all exons of the IDUA gene
  from a patient with a clinical phenotype of severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I
  syndrome. Enzyme activity of alpha-L-iduronidase was quantified by fluorimetric
  assay. Additionally, a molecular dynamics simulation approach was used to determine
  the effect of the Ser633Trp mutation on the structure and dynamics of the alpha-L-iduronidase.
  The DNA sequencing analysis and enzymatic activity shows a c.1898C>G mutation associated
  a patient with a homozygous state and alpha-L-iduronidase activity of 0.24 mumol/L/h,
  respectively. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis shows that the p.Ser633Trp
  mutation on the alpha-L-iduronidase affect significant the temporal and spatial
  properties of the different structural loops, the N-glycan attached to Asn372 and
  amino acid residues around the catalytic site of this enzyme. Low enzymatic activity
  observed for p.Ser633Trp variant of the alpha-L-iduronidase seems to lead to severe
  mucopolysaccharidosis type I phenotype, possibly associated with a perturbation
  of the structural dynamics in regions of the enzyme close to the active site.'
