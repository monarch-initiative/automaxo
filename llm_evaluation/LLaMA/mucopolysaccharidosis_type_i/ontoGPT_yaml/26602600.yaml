input_text: 'Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in children with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea
  syndrome (OSAS) is very common in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the preferred treatment for patients with severe
  MPS I diagnosed early in life. The protective effect of HSCT on the development
  of long term OSAS is not known. METHODS: Overnight polysomnography (PSG) and biomarker
  data were analyzed during the annual follow-up in consecutive MPS I patients treated
  with HSCT. RESULTS: The data of 13 patients (6 boys) were analyzed. Median age at
  HSCT was 17 (range 14-19) months, median age at PSG was 9.0 (4.5-14.5) years, and
  median time elapsed since HSCT was 7.6 (2.4-13.2) years. A significant correlation
  was observed between time elapsed since HSCT and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI,
  r(2)=0.493, p=+0.003) and the oxygen desaturation index (r(2)=0.424, p=+0.02). Patients
  older than 10 years of age had a higher mean AHI (25.8/h vs 1.4/h, p=0.0008), a
  lower mean pulse oximetry (94.7% vs 97.2%, p=0.01) and a higher mean hypopnea index
  (18.8 vs 0.71/h, p=0.016) as compared to those younger than 10 years of age. No
  correlation was observed between the AHI and the metabolic clearance, assessed by
  urine glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion and residual enzyme activity, although there
  was a positive trend for the urinary GAG/higher normal value for age ratio (p=0.09).
  CONCLUSION: HSCT does not offer long term protection against OSAS in MPS I with
  OSAS being documented in all patients after a time elapse since HSCT exceeding 10
  years. The potential benefit of additional enzyme replacement therapy needs to be
  assessed.'
