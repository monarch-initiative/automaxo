input_text: "Mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I: the 30-year University of Minnesota experience. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mucopolysaccharidosis
  IH (MPS IH, Hurler syndrome) naturally leads to death within the first decade of
  life, primarily from cardiac and pulmonary causes. To determine how hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has altered mortality, we analyzed our institution's
  30-year experience of patients with MPS IH undergoing HSCT. METHODS: Using chart
  review and the National Death Index, we determined survival status of 134 patients
  (males = 69) with MPS IH transplanted between 9/16/1983 and 7/25/2013 on 12/31/2013.
  Analysis included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curves, and regression analysis
  by Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Overall survival (95% CI) at one- and
  25-years was 70% (62-78%) and 37% (19-55%), respectively. From 2004 onward, overall
  survival at one- and 8-years was 84% (73-96%) and 81% (69-94%), respectively, compared
  to 65% (55-74%) and 57% (47-67%) prior to 2004 (Log-rank p = 0.032). Regardless
  of era, male survival was significantly better than female (HR 0.40, [95% CI: 0.21-0.74],
  p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of death (95% CI) at 25 years was 63% (45-81%);
  incidence of pulmonary-related death was the highest at 27% (10-41%) compared to
  8% (0.3-16%) for cardiac, 12% (6-17%) for infectious disease, and 16% (3-27%) from
  other complications. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT has increased survival in MPS IH beyond the
  third decade of life and decreased the incidence of cardiac mortality, but deaths
  after the third year post-HSCT occur in excess of expected US mortality. It is important
  to determine if improved transplant strategies since 2004 result in better long-term
  survival in the current patient population."
