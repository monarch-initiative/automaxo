input_text: Intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy reverses cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease
  that seriously affects the brain. Severity of neurocognitive symptoms in attenuated
  MPS subtype (MPS IA) broadly varies partially, due to restricted permeability of
  blood-brain barrier (BBB) which limits treatment effects of intravenously applied
  alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) enzyme. Intrathecal (IT) rhIDU application as a possible
  solution to circumvent BBB improved brain outcomes in canine models; therefore,
  our study quantifies effects of IT rhIDU on brain structure and function in an MPS
  IA patient with previous progressive cognitive decline. Neuropsychological testing
  and MRIs were performed twice prior (baseline, at 1 year) and twice after initiating
  IT rhIDU (at 2nd and 3rd years). The difference between pre- and post-treatment
  means was evaluated as a percentage of the change. Neurocognitive performance improved
  particularly in memory tests and resulted in improved school performance after IT
  rhIDU treatment. White matter (WM) integrity improved together with an increase
  of WM and corpus callosum volumes. Hippocampal and gray matter volume decreased
  which may either parallel reduction of glycosaminoglycan storage or reflect typical
  longitudinal brain changes in early adulthood. In conclusion, our outcomes suggest
  neurological benefits of IT rhIDU compared to the intravenous administration on
  brain structure and function in a single MPS IA patient.  2017 Wiley Periodicals,
