input_text: Laronidase-loaded liposomes reach the brain and other hard-to-treat organs
  after noninvasive nasal administration. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is
  caused by lack of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), responsible for
  the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan and heparan sulfate, leading
  to multisystemic signs and symptoms. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment
  that consists of weekly intravenous administrations of laronidase, a recombinant
  version of IDUA. However, ERT have limited access to certain tissues, such as bone,
  cartilage, and brain, and laronidase fails to trespass the BBB. In this sense, this
  study reports the development and characterization of laronidase-loaded liposomes
  for the treatment of MPS I mice. Liposomal complexes were obtained by the thin film
  formation method followed by microfluidization. The main characterization results
  showed vesicle size of 103.0 +- 3.3 nm, monodisperse populations of vesicles, zeta
  potential around + 30.0 +- 2.1 mV, and mucoadhesion strength of 5.69 +- 0.14 mN.
  Treatment of MPS I mouse fibroblasts showed significant increase in enzyme activity.
  Nasal administration of complexes to MPS I mice resulted in significant increase
  in laronidase activity in the brain cortex, heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and serum.
  The overall results demonstrate the feasibility of nasal administration of laronidase-loaded
  liposomes to deliver enzyme in difficult-to-reach tissues, circumventing ERT issues
  and bringing hope as a potential treatment for MPS I.
