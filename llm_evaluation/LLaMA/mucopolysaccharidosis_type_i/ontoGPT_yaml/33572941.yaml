input_text: 'Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: Current Treatments, Limitations, and Prospects
  for Improvement. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal disease, caused
  by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). IDUA catalyzes the degradation
  of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate (DS and HS, respectively).
  Lack of the enzyme leads to pathologic accumulation of undegraded HS and DS with
  subsequent disease manifestations in multiple organs. The disease can be divided
  into severe (Hurler syndrome) and attenuated (Hurler-Scheie, Scheie) forms. Currently
  approved treatments consist of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with attenuated disease are often treated
  with ERT alone, while the recommended therapy for patients with Hurler syndrome
  consists of HSCT. While these treatments significantly improve disease manifestations
  and prolong life, a considerable burden of disease remains. Notably, treatment can
  partially prevent, but not significantly improve, clinical manifestations, necessitating
  early diagnosis of disease and commencement of treatment. This review discusses
  these standard therapies and their impact on common disease manifestations in patients
  with MPS I. Where relevant, results of animal models of MPS I will be included.
  Finally, we highlight alternative and emerging treatments for the most common disease
  manifestations.'
