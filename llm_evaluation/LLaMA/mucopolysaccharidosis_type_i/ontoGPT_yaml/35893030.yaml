  Literature Review. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare inherited lysosomal
  disorder caused by deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme, resulting in the
  progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which interfere with the
  normal function of multiple tissues and organs. The clinical phenotype includes
  characteristic facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, umbilical
  and inguinal hernias, progressive cognitive deficits with corresponding hydrocephalus,
  and neuropathology. Untreated children do not survive into the second decade. The
  common cardiac phenotype seen in MPS I and other MPS types includes valve thickening
  and dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy-usually
  seen later in the disease course. A 15-month-old ex-35-weeker who presented with
  cardiomyopathy and left ventricular failure at the age of three weeks is presented
  here. Early evaluation and diagnosis with the help of newborn screening (NBS), followed
  by treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT), resulted in improvement of his cardiopulmonary status. In MPS I, an early
  cardiac phenotype is uncommon. Based on the evidence from the literature review
  for early neonatal cardiac phenotype, we propose that all infants with abnormal
  newborn screening for MPS I should receive cardiac screening with echocardiogram
  and NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) during the initial evaluation.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
