input_text: 'Comparison of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate concentrations in
  serum, cerebrospinal fluid and urine in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I receiving intravenous and intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy. AIMS: To validate
  a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the measurement
  of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in plasma and serum. To establish plasma, cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) and urine reference intervals. To compare GAGs in serum with that in
  urine and CSF from patients with MPS I. METHODS: Dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan
  sulfate (HS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) in serum/plasma, urine and CSF were methanolysed
  into dimers and analyzed using pseudo isotope dilution UPLC-MS/MS assay. Serum,
  CSF and urine DS and HS were quantified for 11 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  (MPS) type I before and after treatment with Aldurazyme  (laronidase) enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT). RESULTS: The method showed acceptable imprecision and recovery for
  the quantification of serum/plasma CS, DS, and HS. The serum, urine, and CSF DS
  and HS concentrations were reduced after 26 weeks of ERT in 4 previously untreated
  patients. Serum DS and HS concentrations normalized in some patients, and were mildly
  elevated in others after ERT. In contrast, urine and CSF DS and HS values remained
  elevated above the reference ranges. Compared with serum GAGs, urine and CSF DS
  and HS were more sensitive biomarkers for monitoring the ERT treatment of patients
  with MPS I.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)

  medical_actions: Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy; intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy; treatment with Aldurazyme (laronidase)

  symptoms: Elevated dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparan sulfate (HS) concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine

  chemicals: Dermatan sulfate (DS); heparan sulfate (HS); chondroitin sulfate (CS); Aldurazyme (laronidase)

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - Aldurazyme (laronidase) TREATS elevated DS and HS concentrations IN MPS I; 
  - Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy TREATS elevated DS and HS concentrations IN MPS I; 
  - Intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy TREATS elevated DS and HS concentrations IN MPS I; 
  - Treatment (with Aldurazyme) REDUCES DS and HS concentrations in serum, urine, and CSF IN MPS I; 
  - Enzyme replacement therapy NORMALIZES serum DS and HS concentrations IN MPS I; 
  - Enzyme replacement therapy TREATS urine and CSF DS and HS values IN MPS I.
