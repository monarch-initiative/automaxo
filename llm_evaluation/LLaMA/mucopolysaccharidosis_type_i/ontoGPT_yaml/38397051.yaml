input_text: Efficacy of a Combination Therapy with Laronidase and Genistein in Treating
  Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I in a Mouse Model. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency. The
  standard treatment, enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase, has limited effectiveness
  in treating neurological symptoms due to poor blood-brain barrier penetration. An
  alternative is substrate reduction therapy using molecules, such as genistein, which
  crosses this barrier. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of
  laronidase and genistein in a mouse model of MPS I. Over 12 weeks, MPS I and wild-type
  mice received laronidase, genistein, or both. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage in
  visceral organs and the brain, its excretion in urine, and the serum level of the
  heparin cofactor II-thrombin (HCII-T) complex, along with behavior, were assessed.
  The combination therapy resulted in reduced GAG storage in the heart and liver,
  whereas genistein alone reduced the brain GAG storage. Laronidase and combination
  therapy decreased liver and spleen weights and significantly reduced GAG excretion
  in the urine. However, this therapy negated some laronidase benefits in the HCII-T
  levels. Importantly, the combination therapy improved the behavior of female mice
  with MPS I. These findings offer valuable insights for future research to optimize
  MPS I treatments.
