input_text: 'Treatment of Severe Kyphoscoliosis in Children with Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I (Pfaundler-Hurler Syndrome) Using the Growing Rod Technique: A Case Series
  with Mid-Term Results. BACKGROUND: Patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS
  I) have a good life expectancy due to early therapeutic options, such as stem cell
  therapy. Stem cell therapy can prevent the progression of some skeletal malformations.
  In contrast, the progression of thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, genua vara, and hip
  dysplasia cannot be influenced. We present 3 cases of children with MPS I with thoracolumbar
  kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis treated with a growing rod system. CASE DESCRIPTION: The
  medical records and radiologic imaging of 3 children with a diagnosis of MPS I and
  kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis of the lumbar spine treated between 2007 and 2019 were retrospectively
  analyzed. Two children presented with a kyphoscoliosis, and 1 child had a combination
  of severe anterolisthesis and kyphoscoliosis. Surgery to correct the kyphosis and
  dorsal stabilization was performed in all patients after exhausted conservative
  treatment. There were no neurologic complications. Postoperative treatment and aftercare
  included a corset for 4 months and physical therapy. In all 3 patients, distraction
  surgery of the lumbar stabilization was done twice at a mean interval of 1 year.
  CONCLUSIONS: If conservative treatment fails and surgery is necessary, an individual
  approach is needed. Dorsal stabilization with pedicle screws using a growing rod
  technique is an option for the correction of thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis in children
  with MPS I. However, fusion should be prevented initially or should be kept as short
  as possible. We achieved acceptable correction of the spinal deformity using the
  growing rod technique. Finally, surgery with correction and fusion is necessary
  after exhausted correction potential.'
