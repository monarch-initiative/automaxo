input_text: "Hematopoietic Stem- and Progenitor-Cell Gene Therapy for Hurler Syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the standard of
  care for Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Hurler variant [MPSIH]).
  However, this treatment is only partially curative and is associated with complications.
  METHODS: We are conducting an ongoing study involving eight children with MPSIH.
  At enrollment, the children lacked a suitable allogeneic donor and had a Developmental
  Quotient or Intelligence Quotient score above 70 (i.e., none had moderate or severe
  cognitive impairment). The children received autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor
  cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with an alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)-encoding lentiviral
  vector after myeloablative conditioning. Safety and correction of blood IDUA activity
  up to supraphysiologic levels were the primary end points. Clearance of lysosomal
  storage material as well as skeletal and neurophysiological development were assessed
  as secondary and exploratory end points. The planned duration of the study is 5
  years. RESULTS: We now report interim results. The children's mean (+-SD) age at
  the time of HSPC gene therapy was 1.9+-0.5 years. At a median follow-up of 2.10
  years, the procedure had a safety profile similar to that known for autologous hematopoietic
  stem-cell transplantation. All the patients showed prompt and sustained engraftment
  of gene-corrected cells and had supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity within a month,
  which was maintained up to the latest follow-up. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
  excretion decreased steeply, reaching normal levels at 12 months in four of five
  patients who could be evaluated. Previously undetectable levels of IDUA activity
  in the cerebrospinal fluid became detectable after gene therapy and were associated
  with local clearance of GAGs. Patients showed stable cognitive performance, stable
  motor skills corresponding to continued motor development, improved or stable findings
  on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, reduced joint stiffness, and
  normal growth in line with World Health Organization growth charts. CONCLUSIONS:
  The delivery of HSPC gene therapy in patients with MPSIH resulted in extensive metabolic
  correction in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. (Funded by Fondazione
  Telethon and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03488394; EudraCT number, 2017-002430-23.)."
