input_text: CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing in human MPS I fibroblasts. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). It is caused by mutations
  in the IDUA gene, which lead to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan
  and heparan sulfate. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a new and powerful tool that allows
  gene editing at precise points of the genome, resulting in gene correction through
  the introduction and genomic integration of a wildtype sequence. In this study,
  we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to correct in vitro the most common
  mutation causing MPS I. Human fibroblasts homozygous for p.Trp402* (legacy name
  W402X) were transfected and analyzed for up to one month after treatment. IDUA activity
  was significantly increased, lysosomal mass was decreased, and next generation sequencing
  confirmed that a percentage of cells carried the wildtype sequence. As a proof of
  concept, this study demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing may be used to
  correct causative mutations in MPS I. LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.
