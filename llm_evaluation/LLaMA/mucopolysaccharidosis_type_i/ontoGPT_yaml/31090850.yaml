input_text: 'CASE SERIES OF PATIENTS UNDER BIWEEKLY TREATMENT WITH LARONIDASE: A REPORT
  OF A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE. OBJECTIVE: To report the stabilization of urinary
  glycosaminoglicans (GAG) excretion and clinical improvements in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) under an alternative dose regimen of laronidase of 1.2 mg/kg every
  other week. METHODS: We participated in a dose-optimization trial for laronidase
  in MPS-I patients using four alternative regimens: 0.58 mg/kg every week, 1.2 mg/kg
  every two weeks, 1.2 mg/kg every week and 1.8 mg/kg every other week (EOW). After
  the trial ended, the patients resumed the recommended dose and regimen of 0.58 mg/kg
  every week. Under this regimen, some patients presented difficulties in venous access
  and were unable to commute weekly to the treatment center. Therefore, we used an
  alternative regimen that consisted of 1.2 mg/kg EOW in eight patients. A retrospective
  study of medical records of MPS-I patients who underwent both enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) regimens, of 0.58 mg/kg every week and 1.2 mg/kg EOW, was done. RESULTS:
  Patients remained clinically stable under the alternative regimen, did not present
  elevation of urinary GAG nor any adverse event.Conclusions: The switch of dose regimen
  to 1.2 mg/kg EOW of laronidase was safe, and did not cause any clinical worsening
  in patients who had been previously under standard dose ERT.'

  Here are the extracted entities in the requested format:

  primary_disease: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)

  medical_actions: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT); biweekly treatment with laronidase; treatment with laronidase at 0.58 mg/kg every week; treatment with laronidase at 1.2 mg/kg every two weeks; treatment with laronidase at 1.2 mg/kg every week; treatment with laronidase at 1.8 mg/kg every other week

  symptoms: difficulties in venous access; elevation of urinary glycosaminoglicans (GAG); clinical worsening; adverse event

  chemicals: laronidase

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  treatment with laronidase (at 0.58 mg/kg every week) TREATS MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.2 mg/kg every two weeks) TREATS MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.2 mg/kg every week) TREATS MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.8 mg/kg every other week) TREATS MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.2 mg/kg EOW) PREVENTS clinical worsening IN MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.2 mg/kg EOW) PREVENTS elevation of urinary GAG IN MPS I; 
  treatment with laronidase (at 1.2 mg/kg EOW) PREVENTS adverse event IN MPS I.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
