input_text: ZFN-Mediated In Vivo Genome Editing Corrects Murine Hurler Syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is a severe disease due to deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase
  alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) and the subsequent accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans
  (GAG), leading to progressive, systemic disease and a shortened lifespan. Current
  treatment options consist of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which carries
  significant mortality and morbidity risk, and enzyme replacement therapy, which
  requires lifelong infusions of replacement enzyme; neither provides adequate therapy,
  even in combination. A novel in vivo genome-editing approach is described in the
  murine model of Hurler syndrome. A corrective copy of the IDUA gene is inserted
  at the albumin locus in hepatocytes, leading to sustained enzyme expression, secretion
  from the liver into circulation, and subsequent uptake systemically at levels sufficient
  for correction of metabolic disease (GAG substrate accumulation) and prevention
  of neurobehavioral deficits in MPS I mice. This study serves as a proof-of-concept
  for this platform-based approach that should be broadly applicable to the treatment
  of a wide array of monogenic diseases.
