input_text: 'An online survey on burden of illness among families with post-stem cell
  transplant mucopolysaccharidosis type I children in the United States. BACKGROUND:
  Severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I (also known as Hurler syndrome) is a rare devasting
  recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of an enzyme. Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant is the standard of care in the United States, usually conducted
  before the child is 3 years of age, but little is known about the continued medical
  and educational needs of the child after transplant. A greater understanding of
  the burden of illness on the primary caregiver is also needed. Therefore, this online
  survey sought to gather information on the burden of severe MPS I in the United
  States at least 1 year after transplant. RESULTS: Thirty-two respondents reported
  that children with severe MPS I have significant medical and educational needs after
  transplant. Healthcare resource use was frequent, especially in the outpatient setting
  specifically for bone, cardiac, and vision complications that were not relieved
  by HSCT. Twenty-five percent of the children had been hospitalized at least once
  in the last year and two had been hospitalized twice. The most common reasons for
  overnight hospitalizations included orthopedic surgeries and respiratory infections.
  Among children ages 5 and older, only 3 of 28 (11%) were able to attend school with
  no special support. While caregivers were generally satisfied with the healthcare
  services their child receives, 69% of working caregivers reported negative impact
  on their ability to conduct work tasks, and 54% of caregivers did not work so that
  they could care for the child. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that severe MPS I children
  continue to  require medical care and special support for education. Future research
  on the burden of illness on families affected by severe MPS I is needed to better
  understand total cost of care, and to identify therapies and interventions that
  reduce burden of illness. Future studies that compare cost of and access to health
  care in different countries may provide a more global view of the burden of MPS
  I.'
