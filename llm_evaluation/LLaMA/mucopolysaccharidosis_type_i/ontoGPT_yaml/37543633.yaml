input_text: Mapping brain networks in MPS I mice and their restoration following gene
  therapy. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal disorder
  that causes syndromes characterized by physiological dysfunction in many organs
  and tissues. Despite the recognizable morphological and behavioral deficits associated
  with MPS I, neither the underlying alterations in functional neural connectivity
  nor its restoration following gene therapy have been shown. By employing high-resolution
  resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we found significant reductions in functional neural
  connectivity in the limbic areas of the brain that play key roles in learning and
  memory in MPS I mice, and that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy
  can reestablish most brain connectivity. Using logistic regression in MPS I and
  treated animals, we identified functional networks with the most alterations. The
  rs-fMRI and statistical methods should be translatable into clinical evaluation
  of humans with neurological disorders.
