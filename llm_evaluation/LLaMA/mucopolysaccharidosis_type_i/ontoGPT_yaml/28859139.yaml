input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of intravenous laronidase for mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of IV laronidase for MPS I. METHODS: A systematic literature review was
  performed by searching the ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, and
  Cochrane Library databases, limited to clinical trials published until December
  31, 2016. The first inclusion criterion was being a randomized controlled trial
  (RCT). If < five RCTs were identified, open-label and nonrandomized trials, controlled
  or uncontrolled (quasi-experimental), including >= five patients, and evaluating
  relevant outcomes defined a priori, would also be included. For meta-analysis, primary
  inferences were based on random-effects models. Assessment of article quality was
  performed in accordance with the GRADE criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
  was used to examine the risk of bias for RCTs. RESULTS: The selection phase retrieved
  632 articles. During the first phase of selection, 158 had the abstract or full
  text read for assessment of eligibility, of which nine (two RCTs) were included
  for qualitative synthesis. Four papers were included in the meta-analysis, which
  was performed for the following outcomes: occurrence of treatment-emergent or infusion-related
  adverse events (65%; 95%CI 53, 76), mild in most cases; development of IgG antibodies
  to laronidase (88%; 95%CI 67, 100); apnea-hypopnea index (not significant-NS), urinary
  glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [mean change -65.5 mug/mg creatinine (95%CI -68.8, -62.3)],
  liver size [mean change -31.03% (95%CI -36.1, -25.9)], left ventricular mass index
  (LVMI) [mean change -1.8 (95%CI -2.32, -0.25)], and distance covered in the 6-minute
  walk test (NS). Among the outcomes not included in meta-analysis, we found evidence
  for benefit of laronidase only on shoulder flexion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
  that IV laronidase effectively reduces urinary GAGs excretion, hepatomegaly and
  LVMI, and can improve shoulder flexion in MPS I patients. Laronidase appears to
  be safe in the studied population.'

  symptoms: Apnea-hypopnea; infusion-related adverse events; development of IgG antibodies to laronidase; hepatomegaly; increased liver size; increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI); reduced distance covered in the 6-minute walk test; reduced shoulder flexion; increased urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)

  chemicals: Laronidase

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  Laronidase TREATS urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) IN MPS I; 
  Laronidase TREATS hepatomegaly IN MPS I; 
  Laronidase TREATS left ventricular mass index (LVMI) IN MPS I; 
  Laronidase TREATS shoulder flexion IN MPS I; 
  treatment (with laronidase) TREATS apnea-hypopnea IN MPS I; 
  treatment (with laronidase) PREVENTS infusion-related adverse events IN MPS I;

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
