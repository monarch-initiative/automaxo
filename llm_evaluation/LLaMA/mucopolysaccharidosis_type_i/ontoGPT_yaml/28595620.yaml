input_text: 'Transcranial pulsed ultrasound facilitates brain uptake of laronidase
  in enzyme replacement therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I disease. BACKGROUND:
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a debilitating hereditary disease characterized
  by alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and consequent inability to degrade glycosaminoglycans.
  The pathological accumulation of glycosaminoglycans systemically results in severe
  mental retardation and multiple organ dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy with
  recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) improves the function of some organs
  but not neurological deficits owing to its exclusion from the brain by the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB). METHODS: We divided MPS I mice into control group, enzyme replacement
  group with rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg injection, enzyme replacement with one-spot ultrasound
  treatment group, and enzyme replacement with two-spot ultrasound treatment group,
  and compare treatment effectiveness between groups. All ultrasound treatments were
  applied on left side brain. Evans blue was used to simulate the distribution of
  rhIDU in the brain. RESULTS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound combined
  with microbubbles facilitates brain rhIDU delivery in MPS I mice receiving systemic
  enzyme replacement therapy. With intravenously injected rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg, the IDUA
  enzyme activity on the ultrasound treated side of the cerebral hemisphere raised
  to 7.81-fold that on the untreated side and to 75.84% of its normal value. Evans
  blue simulation showed the distribution of the delivered drug was extensive, involving
  a large volume of the treated cerebral hemisphere. Two-spot ultrasound treatment
  scheme is more efficient for brain rhIDU delivery than one-spot ultrasound treatment
  scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound can open BBB
  extensively and facilitates brain rhIDU delivery. This novel technology may provide
  a new MPS I treatment strategy.'
