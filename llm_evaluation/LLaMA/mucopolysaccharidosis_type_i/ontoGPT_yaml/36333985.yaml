input_text: '18-year follow-up of enzyme-replacement therapy in two siblings with
  attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal
  recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase and characterized
  by a progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, MPS I is divided
  into two forms: (1) severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized
  by rapid progressive neurological involvement; (2) attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and
  Scheie syndromes), which displays a slower progression and absent to mild nervous
  system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated MPS I consists of enzyme-replacement
  therapy with laronidase (human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We
  present updated data after 18 years of laronidase treatment in two siblings affected
  by the attenuated form of MPS I who started therapy at 5 months and 5 years of age,
  respectively. Clinical and laboratory data of the siblings show that long-term enzyme
  replacement therapy may improve/stabilize many symptoms already present at the time
  of the diagnosis and reduce the disease progression. This study confirms that early
  diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy are essential to modify
  positively the natural history of the attenuated form of MPS I.'

  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
