  I-Hurler (MPS I-H) is the most severe form of a metabolic genetic disease caused

  I-H is a rare, life-threatening disease, evolving in multisystem morbidity including
  progressive neurological disease, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity and
  cardiomyopathy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently
  the gold standard for the treatment of MPS I-H in patients diagnosed and treated
  before 2-2.5 years of age, having a high rate of success. Beyond the child's age,
  other factors influence the probability of treatment success, including the selection
  of patients, of graft source and the donor type employed. Enzyme replacement therapy
  (ERT) with human recombinant laronidase has also been demonstrated to be effective
  in ameliorating the clinical conditions of pre-transplant MPS I-H patients and in
  improving HSCT outcome, by peri-transplant co-administration. Nevertheless the long-term
  clinical outcome even after successful HSCT varies considerably, with a persisting
  residual disease burden. Other strategies must then be considered to improve the
  outcome of these patients: one is to pursue early pre-symptomatic diagnosis through
  newborn screening and another one is the identification of novel treatments. In
  this perspective, even though newborn screening can be envisaged as a future attractive
  perspective, presently the best path to be pursued embraces an improved awareness
  of signs and symptoms of the disorder by primary care providers and pediatricians,
  in order for the patients' timely referral to a qualified reference center. Furthermore,
  sensitive new biochemical markers must be identified to better define the clinical
  severity of the disease at birth, to support clinical judgement during the follow-up
  and to compare the effects of the different therapies. A prolonged neuropsychological
  follow-up of post-transplant cognitive development of children and residual disease
  burden is needed. In this perspective, the reference center must guarantee a multidisciplinary
  follow-up with an expert team. Diagnostic and interventional protocols of reference
  centers should be standardized whenever possible to allow comparison of clinical
  data and evaluation of results. This review will focus on all these critical issues
  related to the management of MPS I-H."
