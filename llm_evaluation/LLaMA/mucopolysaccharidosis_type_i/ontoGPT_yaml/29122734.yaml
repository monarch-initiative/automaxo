input_text: Gene editing of MPS I human fibroblasts by co-delivery of a CRISPR/Cas9
  plasmid and a donor oligonucleotide using nanoemulsions as nonviral carriers. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) is an inherited disease caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase
  (IDUA). This study shows the use of nanoemulsions co-complexed with the plasmid
  of CRISPR/Cas9 system and a donor oligonucleotide aiming at MPS I gene editing in
  vitro. Nanoemulsions composed of MCT, DOPE, DOTAP, DSPE-PEG, and water were prepared
  by high-pressure homogenization. The DNA was complexed by adsorption (NA) or encapsulation
  (NE) of preformed DNA/DOTAP complexes with nanoemulsions at +4/-1 charge ratio.
  The incubation in pure DMEM or supplemented with serum showed that the complexation
  with DNA was stable after 1 h of incubation, but the complexes tended to release
  the adsorbed DNA after 24 h of incubation, while the encapsulated DNA remained complexed
  in the oil core of the nanoemulsions even 48 h after incubation with DMEM. The treatment
  of MPS I patient's fibroblasts homozygous for the p.Trp402* mutation led to a significant
  increase in IDUA activity at 2, 15, and 30 days when compared to MPS I untreated
  fibroblasts. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy demonstrated that there was
  a reduction in the area of lysosomes to values similar to normal, an indicator of
  correction of the cellular phenotype. These results show that the nanoemulsions
  co-complexed with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a donor oligonucleotide could effectively
  transfect MPS I p.Trp402* patient's fibroblasts, as well as enable the production
  of IDUA, and represent a potential new treatment option for MPS I.
