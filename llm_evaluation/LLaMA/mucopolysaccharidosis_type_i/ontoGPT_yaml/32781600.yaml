input_text: 'Lower Exposure to Busulfan Allows for Stable Engraftment of Donor Hematopoietic
  Stem Cells in Children with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: A Case Report of Four
  Patients. Busulfan is an alkylating agent routinely used in conditioning regimens
  prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for various nonmalignant
  disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism. The combination of model-based
  dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of busulfan pharmacokinetics (PK) to
  a lower exposure target has the potential to reduce the regimen-related toxicity
  while opening marrow niches sufficient for engraftment in diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I). We present four cases of the severe form of MPS I or Hurler syndrome,
  demonstrating successful and stable CD14/15 donor chimerism following the prospective
  application of model-based dosing and TDM aimed to achieve lower busulfan exposure.
  All patients received a busulfan-based conditioning regimen with a median cumulative
  area-under-the-curve (cAUC) target of 63.7 mg h/L (range, 62.4 to 65.0) in protocol-specific
  combination of chemotherapeutic regimen. The donor source was unrelated umbilical
  cord blood for three patients and matched sibling donor bone marrow for one patient.
  The observed median busulfan cAUC was 66.1 mg h/L (range, 65.2 to 70.6) and was
  within 10% of the intended target. Stable, full donor myeloid chimerism was achieved
  for three patients, while one patient achieved a stable mixed chimerism (76% donor
  CD14/15 at 53 months) without a recurring need for enzyme replacement. The normalization
  of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme levels followed the attainment of successful donor
  myeloid chimerism in all patients. Regimen-related toxicity remained low with no
  evidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and chronic GVHD.'
