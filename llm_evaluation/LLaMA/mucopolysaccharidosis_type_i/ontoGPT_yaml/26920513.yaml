  enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I: A comprehensive meta-analysis of pooled data
  from multiple studies. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase has an important
  role in the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Laronidase
  is safe and has demonstrated effectiveness in terms of stabilizing or improving
  conventional clinical and laboratory markers of the disease. However, like most
  ERTs, laronidase produces an anti-drug IgG antibody response in more than 90% of
  patients during the first few months of treatment. Preclinical data from the MPS
  I canine model suggest that anti-drug antibodies (ADA) impair enzyme uptake in target
  tissues. In patients, the effects on tissue glycosaminoglycan (GAG) clearance are
  difficult to assess directly but data from clinical studies have suggested an association
  between ADA and both a reduced pharmacodynamic response and hypersensitivity reactions.
  This comprehensive meta-analysis of pooled data from patients in three clinical
  studies of laronidase (including one study with an extension) was undertaken to
  provide a more robust assessment of the relationship between the ADA response to
  laronidase, clinical and laboratory markers of MPS I, and hypersensitivity reactions.
  The meta-analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between the ADA response
  and the percent reduction in urinary GAG (uGAG) levels. However, no relationships
  between the ADA response and changes in percent predicted forced vital capacity
  and six-minute walk test were seen. The study also re-assayed stored serum samples
  from the original trials with a novel method to determine the inhibitory effect
  of ADA. Patients with higher ADA exposure over time were found to have higher inhibition
  of enzyme uptake into cells. High ADA exposure can result in a commensurate level
  of enzyme uptake inhibition that decreases the pharmacodynamic effect of the exogenously
  administered therapeutic enzyme, but with no clear effect on clinical efficacy. '
