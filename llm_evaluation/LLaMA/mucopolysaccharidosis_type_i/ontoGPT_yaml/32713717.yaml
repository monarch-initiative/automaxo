input_text: The evolution of pulmonary function in childhood onset Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I. Respiratory outcomes in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), have mainly
  focused on upper airway obstruction, with the evolution of the restrictive lung
  disease being poorly documented. We report the long-term pulmonary function outcomes
  and examine the potential factors affecting these in 2 cohorts of MPS I patients,
  those who have undergone Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and those
  treated with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). The results were stratified using
  the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. 66 patients, capable of adequately
  performing testing, were identified by a retrospective case note review, 46 transplanted
  (45 Hurler, 1 Non-Hurler) and 20 having ERT (17 Non-Hurler and 3 Hurler diagnosed
  too late for HSCT). 5 patients died; 4 in the ERT group including the 3 Hurler patients.
  Overall 14% of patients required respiratory support (non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
  or supplemental oxygen)) at the end of follow up. Median length of follow-up was
  12.2 (range = 4.9-32) years post HSCT and 14.34 (range = 3.89-20.4) years on ERT.
  All patients had restrictive lung disease. Cobb angle and male sex were significantly
  associated with more severe outcomes in the HSCT cohort, with 49% having severe
  to very severe disease. In the 17 Non-Hurler ERT treated patients there was no variable
  predictive of severity of disease with 59% having severe to very severe disease.
  During the course of follow up 67% of the HSCT cohort had no change or improved
  pulmonary function as did 52% of the ERT patients. However, direct comparison between
  therapeutic modalities was not possible. This initial evidence would suggest that
  a degree of restrictive lung disease is present in all treated paediatrically diagnosed
  MPS I and is still a significant cause of morbidity, though further stratification
  incorporating diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is needed.
