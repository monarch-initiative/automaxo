input_text: 'Monitoring of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity in patients with
  mucopolysaccharidoses types I and II on enzyme replacement therapy - Results of
  a pilot study. OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of rare, inherited
  metabolic disorders which result from the lack of one of the lysosomal enzymes responsible
  for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Early recognition of MPS is important
  as it enables prompt implementation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Dipeptidyl
  peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a ubiquitous ectopeptidase which activity has been associated
  with the cell surface protein CD26. Our aims were to investigate plasma DPP-IV activity
  in untreated patients with MPS type II in comparison to control individuals and
  to evaluate changes of DPP-IV during ERT in MPS I or II patients. DESIGN AND METHODS:
  One MPS I and five MPS II patients were treated with ERT for up to 19 months. DPP-IV
  activity was measured in plasma with a colorimetric method using Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide
  as a substrate. The reference intervals were observed in 17 healthy donors and in
  9 MPS II individuals before ERT implementation. RESULTS: DPP-IV activity ranged
  from 557 to 1959 nmol/ml/h (median and interquartile range: 1453 [955- 1554], n
  = 17) in plasma of control samples. In 9 untreated MPS II individuals, DPP-IV activity
  was higher and ranged from 2565 to 5968 nmol/ml/h (median and interquartile range:
  4458 [4031-5161]). In 6 MPS patients receiving ERT, DPP-IV activity ranged from
  2984 to 8628 nmol/ml/h. No declining tendency was observed during the treatment.
  CONCLUSIONS: DPP-IV activity is a good, newa nd valuable biomarker distinguishing
  between MPS and healthy individuals. However, it is not a useful marker of treatment
  efficacy and is unsuitable for monitoring.'
