input_text: Deleterious effects of interruption followed by reintroduction of enzyme
  replacement therapy on a lysosomal storage disorder. Temporary interruption of enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with different lysosomal storage disorders
  may happen for different reasons (adverse reactions, issues with reimbursement,
  logistic difficulties, and so forth), and the impact of the interruption is still
  uncertain. In the present work, we studied the effects of the interruption of intravenous
  ERT (Laronidase, Genzyme) followed by its reintroduction in mice with the prototypical
  lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type I, comparing to mice receiving
  continuous treatment, untreated mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice, and normal mice.
  In the animals which treatment was temporarily interrupted, we observed clear benefits
  of treatment in several organs (liver, lung, heart, kidney, and testis) after reintroduction,
  but a worsening in the thickness of the aortic wall was detected. Furthermore, these
  mice had just partial improvements in behavioral tests, suggesting some deterioration
  in the brain function. Despite worsening is some disease aspects, urinary glycosaminoglycans
  levels did not increase during interruption, which indicates that this biomarker
  commonly used to monitor treatment in patients should not be used alone to assess
  treatment efficacy. The deterioration observed was not caused by the development
  of serum antienzyme antibodies. All together our results suggest that temporary
  ERT interruption leads to deterioration of function in some organs and should be
  avoided whenever possible.

  Here are the extracted entities in the requested format:

  primary_disease: mucopolysaccharidosis type I

  medical_actions: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT); temporary interruption of ERT; reintroduction of ERT; intravenous ERT; continuous treatment

  symptoms: worsening in aortic wall thickness; partial improvements in behavioral tests; deterioration in brain function; increased urinary glycosaminoglycans levels

  chemicals: Laronidase

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) TREATS mucopolysaccharidosis type I;
  - temporary interruption of ERT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS aortic wall thickness IN mucopolysaccharidosis type I;
  - temporary interruption of ERT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS brain function IN mucopolysaccharidosis type I;
  - reintroduction of ERT IMPROVES organ function (liver, lung, heart, kidney, and testis) IN mucopolysaccharidosis type I;
  - Laronidase TREATS mucopolysaccharidosis type I;
  - urinary glycosaminoglycans levels MONITOR treatment efficacy IN mucopolysaccharidosis type I

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
