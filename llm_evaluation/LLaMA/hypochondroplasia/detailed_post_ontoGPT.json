The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia.

                    "abstract": "As part of a larger survey of patients with chondrodysplasias, 197 patients or their parents were asked whether they had undergone orthopedic surgery related to their chondrodysplasia and, if so, to rate their impression of the outcome. Seventy-four patients (37.6%) had undergone a total of 152 procedures (221 if concurrent bilateral operations are counted separately). The percentage of patients treated surgically ranged from a low of 8.3% for hypochondroplasia to a high of 87.5% for diastrophic dysplasia. Of the patients who had surgery, the mean number of procedures per patient ranged from 1.0 for hypochondroplasia to 2.69 for pseudoachondroplasia. Of 180 individual procedures related to the limbs, the outcome in 88.8% was judged 'a bit better' or higher and in 68.8% 'much better' or higher. The responses ranged from a low of 70.4 and 66.7%, respectively for proximal femoral osteotomies to a high of 100 and 85.9% for hip replacement. The comparable figures for spine related surgery were 81.8 and 48.5% with a low of 58.3 and 50.0% for foramen magnum-cervical surgery and a high of 93.8 and 43.8% for thoracolumbar procedures. The expressed perception of lack of satisfaction varied not only by procedure but by diagnosis. Overall, patients perceived a high level of post-surgical improvement, although a number experienced subsequent deterioration and the need for further intervention.",
