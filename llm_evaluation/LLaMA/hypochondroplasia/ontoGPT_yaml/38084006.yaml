input_text: 'Prophylactic Intramedullary Rodding After Femoral Lengthening in Patients
  With Achondroplasia and Hypochondroplasia. BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture after femoral
  lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent
  complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication.
  METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures
  in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients)
  were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation
  removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22
  patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean
  age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm
  (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding
  was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%)
  without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due
  to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after
  prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture
  was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding
  group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection
  or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe
  and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening
  in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-a
  retrospective comparative study.'
