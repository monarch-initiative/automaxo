input_text: Growth-promoting effect of human growth hormone on patients with achondroplasia.
  To evaluate the effect of human growth hormone (hGH) on the growth of children with
  achondroplasia, three patients with achondroplasia and one patient with hypochondroplasia
  were treated with 0.5 IU/kg/W of pituitary-extracted hGH for 6-12 months. Mean height
  velocity was significantly increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm/year (P
  less than 0.05) by hGH. The tibial index, defined as the length/width ratio of left
  tibia, did not change during the treatment, indicating that hGH promotes growth
  without exaggeration of tubular bone deformity. Case 2, who had atlantoaxial dislocation,
  developed sleep apnea and neurological deficits during the second hGH treatment,
  but these were cured by operation. Thus, hGH therapy is effective in promoting growth
  in patients with achondroplasia, but the complication of atlantoaxial dislocation
  should be explored and corrected before the treatment.
