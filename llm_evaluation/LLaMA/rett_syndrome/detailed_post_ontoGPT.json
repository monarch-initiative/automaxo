No cure exists for RTT. We previously reported that the behavioural phenotype and brain mitochondria dysfunction are widely rescued by a single intracerebroventricular injection of the bacterial toxin CNF1 in a RTT mouse model carrying a truncating mutation of the MeCP2 gene (MeCP2-308 mice). Given the heterogeneity of MECP2 mutations in RTT patients, we tested the CNF1 therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model carrying a null mutation (MeCP2-Bird mice). CNF1 selectively rescued cognitive defects, without improving other RTT-related behavioural alterations, and restored brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in MeCP2-Bird mice. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential CNF1 effects on the behavioural phenotype, we compared treatment effects on relevant signalling cascades in the brain of the two RTT models. CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308 hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential therapeutic approaches across RTT models.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "title": "Pre-op considerations in neuromuscular scoliosis deformity surgery: proceedings of the half day course at the 58th annual meeting of the Scoliosis Research Society.",
                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

Previous work has demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that naturally travels from the human gut to the central nervous system (CNS), can deliver proteins to host cells. Here we engineered T. gondii's endogenous secretion systems, the rhoptries and dense granules, to deliver multiple large (>100 kDa) therapeutic proteins into neurons via translational fusions to toxofilin and GRA16. We demonstrate delivery in cultured cells, brain organoids and in vivo, and probe protein activity using imaging, pull-down assays, scRNA-seq and fluorescent reporters. We demonstrate robust delivery after intraperitoneal administration in mice and characterize 3D distribution throughout the brain. As proof of concept, we demonstrate GRA16-mediated brain delivery of the MeCP2 protein, a putative therapeutic target for Rett syndrome. By characterizing the potential and current limitations of the system, we aim to guide future improvements that will be required for broader application.",

Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression.

                    "abstract": "MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both Cdkl5-/y and Cdkl5+/- mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. In vivo, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; ex vivo experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in Cdkl5-/y mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder.

Effective therapies for this devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.",

                    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental disorder Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) causes clinical symptoms similar to Rett syndrome (RTT) patients. However, RTT is caused by MECP2 mutations whereas mutations in the TCF4 gene lead to PTHS. The mechanistic commonalities underling these two disorders are unknown, but their shared symptomology suggest that convergent pathway-level disruption likely exists. We reprogrammed patient skin derived fibroblasts into induced neuronal progenitor cells. Interestingly, we discovered that MeCP2 levels were decreased in PTHS patient iNPCs relative to healthy controls and that both iNPCs and iAstrocytes displayed defects in function and differentiation in a mutation-specific manner. When Tcf4+/- mice were genetically crossed with mice overexpressing MeCP2, molecular and phenotypic defects were significantly ameliorated, underlining and important role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology. Importantly, post-natal intracerebroventricular gene replacement therapy with adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-expressing MeCP2 (AAV9.P546.MeCP2) significantly improved iNPC and iAstrocyte function and effectively ameliorated histological and behavioral defects in Tcf4+/- mice. Combined, our data suggest a previously unknown role of MeCP2 in PTHS pathology and common pathways that might be affected in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Our work highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for PTHS, including upregulation of MeCP2 expression or its downstream targets or, potentially, MeCP2-based gene therapy.",

After gene transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Elevated glutamate production and release from glial cells is a common feature of many CNS disorders. Inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate have been developed to target glutamate overproduction. However, many GLS inhibitors have poor aqueous solubility, are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, or demonstrate significant toxicity when given systemically, precluding translation. Enhanced aqueous solubility and systemic therapy targeted to activated glia may address this challenge. Here we examine the impact of microglial-targeted GLS inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), a developmental disorder with no viable therapies, manifesting profound central nervous system effects, in which elevated glutamatergic tone, upregulation of microglial GLS, oxidative stress and neuroimmune dysregulation are key features. Methods: To enable this, we conjugated a potent glutaminase inhibitor, N-(5-{2-[2-(5-amino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-ethylsulfanyl]-ethyl}-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (JHU29) to a generation 4 hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer (D-JHU29). We then examined the effect of D-JHU29 in organotypic slice culture on glutamate release. We also examined GLS activity in microglial and non-microglial cells, and neurobehavioral phenotype after systemic administration of D-JHU29 in a mouse model of RTT. Results: We report successful conjugation of JHU29 to dendrimer resulting in enhanced water solubility compared to free JHU29. D-JHU29 reduced the excessive glutamate release observed in tissue culture slices in a clinically relevant Mecp2-knockout (KO) RTT mouse. Microglia isolated from Mecp2-KO mice demonstrated upregulation of GLS activity that normalized to wild-type levels following systemic treatment with D-JHU29. Neurobehavioral assessments in D-JHU29 treated Mecp2-KO mice revealed selective improvements in mobility. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors conjugated to dendrimers are a viable mechanism to selectively inhibit microglial GLS to reduce glutamate production and improve mobility in a mouse model of RTT, with broader implications for selectively targeting this pathway in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement) of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient 0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise component of the activity continuum.",

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, several challenges need to be addressed before its widespread clinical application. These challenges include the low delivery efficiencies to target cells, the actual efficiency of the genome-editing process, and the precision with which the CRISPR-Cas system operates. Herein, the study presents a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Assisted Genome Editing (MAGE) platform, which significantly improves the transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, and genome-editing accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology, MAGE is applied to correct the mutated MeCP2 gene in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) from a Rett syndrome patient. By combining magnetofection and magnetic-activated cell sorting, MAGE achieves higher multi-plasmid delivery (99.3%) and repairing efficiencies (42.95%) with significantly shorter incubation times than conventional transfection agents without size limitations on plasmids. The repaired iPSC-NPCs showed similar characteristics as wild-type neurons when they differentiated into neurons, further validating MAGE and its potential for future clinical applications. In short, the developed nanobio-combined CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the potential for various clinical applications, particularly in stem cell therapies targeting different genetic diseases.",

The mechanism of DBS benefits has been elusive, however, so we assessed changes in gene expression, splice isoforms, DNA methylation, and proteome following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and mice lacking Mecp2. We found that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function, cell survival, and neurogenesis and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover, DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused predominantly by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2, encoding transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease, these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective. While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations. We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However, careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls and women with RTT.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT.

                    "abstract": "MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, despite some variability in apparent safety and efficacy, all MECP2 gene therapy studies have been united by a single feat: published treatment paradigms have extended the survival of RTT mice, regardless of injection route, treatment age, or viral genome design. With the possibility of a translatable gene therapy treatment for RTT emerging, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical MECP2 gene therapy studies published thus far is warranted. This review highlights the main findings of these publications and discusses future directions.",

It is considered a multifunctional factor with a prominent role in regulating chromatin structure; however, a full comprehension of the consequences of its deficiency is still lacking. Here, we characterize a novel mouse model of Mecp2 bearing the human mutation Y120D, which is localized in the methyl-binding domain. As most models of Mecp2, the Mecp2Y120D mouse develops a severe Rett-like phenotype. This mutation alters the interaction of the protein with chromatin, but surprisingly, it also impairs its association with corepressors independently on the involved interacting domains. These features, which become overt mainly in the mature brain, cause a more accessible and transcriptionally active chromatin structure; conversely, in the Mecp2-null brain, we find a less accessible and transcriptionally inactive chromatin. By demonstrating that different MECP2 mutations can produce concordant neurological phenotypes but discordant molecular features, we highlight the importance of considering personalized approaches for the treatment of Rett syndrome.",

These disorders underscore the conceptual dose-dependent risk posed by MECP2 gene therapy for mosaic RTT patients. Recently, a miRNA-Responsive Autoregulatory Element (miRARE) mitigated the dose-dependent toxicity posed by self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) miniMECP2 gene therapy (scAAV9/miniMECP2-myc) in mice. Here, we report an efficacy assessment for the human-ready version of this regulated gene therapy (TSHA-102) in male Mecp2-/y knockout (KO) mice after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration at postnatal day 2 (P2) and after intrathecal (IT) administration at P7, P14 (+-immunosuppression), and P28 (+-immunosuppression). We also report qPCR studies on KO mice treated at P7-P35; protein analyses in KO mice treated at P38; and a survival safety study in female adult Mecp2-/+ mice. In KO mice, TSHA-102 improved respiration, weight, and survival across multiple doses and treatment ages. TSHA-102 significantly improved the front average stance and swing times relative to the front average stride time after P14 administration of the highest dose for that treatment age. Viral genomic DNA and miniMECP2 mRNA were present in the CNS. MiniMeCP2 protein expression was higher in the KO spinal cord compared to the brain. In female mice, TSHA-102 permitted survivals that were similar to those of vehicle-treated controls. In all, these pivotal data helped to support the regulatory approval to initiate a clinical trial for TSHA-102 in RTT patients (clinical trial identifier number NCT05606614).",

Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

Moreover, caregivers of patients with RTT face stressors related to patients' medical and developmental concerns. Given the indications from case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. METHODS: Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music therapy program. RESULTS: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition, purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures. Lastly, caregivers in the study group exhibited significantly lower stress following the program. CONCLUSION: The 24-week music therapy program was effective in improving social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, hand function, and reducing seizure frequency among RTT patients. Additionally, music therapy was effective in relieving parenting stress, which may help healthcare providers initiate early intervention strategies that can prevent parenting stress and reduce the risk of depression.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

Here we apply this approach to the brain and successfully repair a guanosine-to-adenosine mutation in methyl CpG binding protein 2 RNA that causes the neurodevelopmental disease Rett syndrome. Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this study, the effect of a remotely supervised, home-based, family-centered individualized rehabilitation program of motor activities for individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused predominantly by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2, encoding transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease, these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective. While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations. We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However, careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist, the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.",

Epigenome editing opens a completely new strategy for basic research of the central nervous system and causal treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, because rewriting of epigenetic information can lead to the direct and durable control of the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we review current advances in the design of locus- and allele-specific DNA-binding modules, approaches for spatial, and temporal control of EpiEffectors and discuss some examples of existing and propose new potential therapeutic strategies based on epigenome editing for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These include the targeted silencing of disease-associated genes or activation of neuroprotective genes which may be applied in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or the control of addiction and depression.

CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308 hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential therapeutic approaches across RTT models.",

Despite promising results from strategies aimed at increasing MeCP2 levels, additional studies exploring how hypomorphic MeCP2 mutations impact the therapeutic window are needed. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically introducing a wild-type MECP2 transgene in the Mecp2 R133C mouse model of RTT. The MECP2 transgene reversed the majority of RTT-like phenotypes exhibited by male and female Mecp2 R133C mice. However, three core symptom domains were adversely affected in female Mecp2R133C/+ animals; these phenotypes resemble those observed in disease contexts of excess MeCP2. Parallel control experiments in Mecp2Null/+ mice linked these adverse effects to the hypomorphic R133C mutation. Collectively, these data provide evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of genetically overexpressing functional MeCP2 in Mecp2 R133C mice and suggest that personalized approaches may warrant consideration for the clinical assessment of MeCP2-targeted therapies.",

Although there are drugs such as aripiprazole, risperidone, and lurasidone, these medications are not cures for the disorders and can only help people feel better or alleviate their symptoms. Thus, it is required to discover therapeutic targets in order to find the ultimate treatments of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is suggested that abnormal neuronal morphology in the neurodevelopment process is a main cause of NDDs, in which the serotonergic system is emerging as playing a crucial role. From this point of view, we noticed the correlation between serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) and NDDs including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome (RTT). 5-HT7R modulators improved altered behaviors in animal models and also affected neuronal morphology via the 5-HT7R/G12 signaling pathway. Through the investigation of recent studies, it is suggested that 5-HT7R could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NDDs.",

For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease. Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered, we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis, utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients, we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected. Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular diseases.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) include a broad spectrum of disorders that disrupt normal brain development. Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Girls and women with Rett Syndrome (RTT) have low levels of daily physical activity and high levels of sedentary time. Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affects many children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

We previously showed that forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis with concomitant improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in a mouse model of RTT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the duration of DBS benefits; characterize DBS effects on hippocampal neurogenesis; and determine whether DBS influences MECP2 genotype and survival of newborn dentate granular cells (DGCs) in RTT mice. METHODS: Chronic DBS was delivered through an electrode implanted in the fimbria-fornix. We tested separate cohorts of mice in contextual and cued fear memory at different time points after DBS. We then examined neurogenesis, DGC apoptosis, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after DBS by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After two weeks of forniceal DBS, memory improvements lasted between 6 and 9 weeks. Repeating DBS every 6 weeks was sufficient to maintain the improvement. Forniceal DBS stimulated the birth of more MeCP2-positive than MeCP2-negative DGCs and had no effect on DGC survival. It also increased the expression of BDNF but not VEGF in the RTT mouse dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: Improvements in learning and memory from forniceal DBS in RTT mice extends well beyond the treatment period and can be maintained by repeated DBS. Stimulation of BDNF expression correlates with improvements in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory benefits.",

                    "abstract": "MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus, gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will facilitate future identification of biomarkers.",
