Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities, daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff, thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions: Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming. Improved communication between all parties may increase participation and well-being and provide solutions for handling unpleasant activities and sedentary time.Significance: A more varied range of activities may improve the everyday life for individuals with Rett syndrome.",
