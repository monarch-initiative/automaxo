input_text: 'Respiratory morbidity in Rett syndrome: an observational study. AIM:
  Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome.
  This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation
  type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett
  database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age
  2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
  over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding,
  and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years
  was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation
  groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly
  twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79,
  95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being
  unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk
  6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate
  risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have
  protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology
  in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are
  indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability
  to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding
  is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking
  mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome

  medical_actions: Hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI); enteral feeding; assisted walking

  symptoms: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI); respiratory morbidity; respiratory illness

  chemicals: None

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - Enteral feeding INCREASES risk of hospital admission for LRTI IN Rett syndrome; 
  - Assisted walking PREVENTS hospital admission for LRTI IN Rett syndrome; 
  - Unable to walk INCREASES risk of hospital admission for LRTI IN Rett syndrome; 
  - Independent walking PROTECTS against hospital admission for LRTI IN Rett syndrome.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
