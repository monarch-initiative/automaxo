input_text: "Functioning, participation, and quality of life in children with intellectual
  disability: an observational study. AIMS: To investigate associations between functioning,
  community participation, and quality of life (QoL) and identify whether participation
  mediates the effects of functioning on QoL. METHOD: The caregivers of 435 children
  (211 females, 224 males; mean age 12y; SD 3y 11mo; age range 5-18y) with intellectual
  disability and autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, or Rett
  syndrome reported on their child's functioning (dependence for managing personal
  needs, mobility, communication, eye contact when speaking), frequency of participation,
  and QoL. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships
  between child functioning, participation, and QoL. RESULTS: Children with greater
  dependency for managing personal needs and limited eye contact when speaking experienced
  poorer QoL. Less impaired functioning was associated with more frequent participation,
  which, in turn, was associated with a 3-point gain in QoL for each additional point
  in frequency of participation (coefficient=2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.78).
  The effect of impaired functioning on QoL was partially mediated by participation
  in children with greater dependency in managing personal needs and those with mildly
  impaired communication. INTERPRETATION: Greater levels of impairments with poorer
  functioning, notably a high level of dependence, were associated with poorer QoL.
  Poorer QoL can be partly explained by less frequent community participation."

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: intellectual disability

  medical_actions: 

  symptoms: dependence for managing personal needs; limited eye contact when speaking; impaired communication; impaired mobility

  chemicals: 

  action_annotation_relationships: 

  Note that there are no specific medical actions, chemicals, or drugs mentioned in the text. The text appears to be a study about the relationship between functioning, participation, and quality of life in children with intellectual disability and other related conditions, rather than a treatment or intervention study. 

  However, some implicit relationships can be inferred:

  - dependence for managing personal needs IS ASSOCIATED WITH poorer QoL IN intellectual disability
  - limited eye contact when speaking IS ASSOCIATED WITH poorer QoL IN intellectual disability
  - participation TREATS QoL IN intellectual disability 
  - functioning IS ASSOCIATED WITH participation IN intellectual disability 
  - participation MEDIATES functioning ON QoL IN intellectual disability 

  Please let me know if you'd like me to reformat or expand on these relationships.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
