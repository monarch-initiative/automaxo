input_text: 'Preclinical milestones in MECP2 gene transfer for treating Rett syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations
  in the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). After gene
  transfer in mice, exogenous MeCP2 expression must be regulated to avoid dose-dependent
  toxicity. SUMMARY: The preclinical gene therapy literature for treating Rett syndrome
  (RTT) illustrates a duly diligent progression that begins with proof-of-concept
  studies and advances toward the development of safer, regulated MECP2 viral genome
  designs. This design progression was partly achieved through international collaborative
  studies. In 2023, clinicians administered investigational gene therapies for RTT
  to patients a decade after the first preclinical gene therapy publications for RTT
  (clinical trial numbers NCT05606614 and NCT05898620). As clinicians take on a more
  prominent role in MECP2 gene therapy research, preclinical researchers may continue
  to test more nuanced hypotheses regarding the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of
  MECP2 gene transfer. KEY MESSAGE: This review summarizes the history of preclinical
  MECP2 gene transfer for treating RTT and acknowledges major contributions among
  colleagues in the field. The first clinical injections are a shared milestone.'
