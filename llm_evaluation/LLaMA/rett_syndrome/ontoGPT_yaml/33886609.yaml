input_text: Generation of cryopreserved macrophages from normal and genetically engineered
  human pluripotent stem cells for disease modelling. Macrophages are innate immune
  cells that play critical roles in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and immune oncology.
  Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) overcome
  many limitations of using peripheral blood derived macrophages. The ability to scale
  up and cryopreserve a large amount of end stage macrophages from single clonal iPSCs
  from normal and disease specific donors offers a unique opportunity for genomic
  analysis and drug screening. The present study describes the step wise generation
  and characterization of macrophages from iPSCs using a defined serum free method
  amenable to scale up to generate a large batch of pure end stage cryopreservable
  macrophages expressing CD68, CD33, CD11c, CD11b, CD1a, HLA-DR, CD86, CD64, CD80,
  CD206, CD169, CD47, HLA-ABC, and CX3CR. The end stage macrophages pre and post cryopreservation
  retain purity, morphology, responsiveness to stimuli and display robust phagocytic
  function coming right out of cryopreservation. The same differentiation process
  was used to generate end stage macrophages from isogenic iPSCs engineered to mimic
  mutations associated with Parkinson's disease (SNCA A53T), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
  (GRN2/GRN R493X), and Rett syndrome (MECP2-Knockout). End stage macrophages from
  isogenic engineered clones displayed differential macrophage-specific purity markers,
  phagocytic function, and response to specific stimuli. Thus, generating a panel
  of functional, physiologically relevant iPSC-derived macrophages can potentially
  facilitate the understanding of neural inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration.
