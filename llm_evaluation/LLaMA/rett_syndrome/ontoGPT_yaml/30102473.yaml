  K, Utine GE. Clinical and molecular evaluation of 16 patients with Rett syndrome.
  Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused
  by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression
  following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on
  major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single
  tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see
  if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype
  correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median
  age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation
  of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age
  at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference
  being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria,
  initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group,
  respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups
  were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence
  of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown
  clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in
  clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria
  revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however,
  further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.'

  Here are the extracted entities in the requested format:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome

  medical_actions: clinical diagnosis; molecular confirmation

  symptoms: neurological regression; diagnostic delay

  chemicals: MECP2

  action_annotation_relationships: 
  - clinical diagnosis TREATS diagnostic delay IN Rett syndrome; 
  - molecular confirmation TREATS diagnostic delay IN Rett syndrome;

  - MECP2 MUTATION CAUSES neurological regression IN Rett syndrome 

  Note that the text does not provide explicit information about specific medical actions (e.g., treatments) that directly target symptoms of Rett syndrome. The focus is on the clinical and molecular evaluation of patients with Rett syndrome, diagnostic criteria, and genotype-phenotype correlations. 

  Also, note that I provided the information available in the text without claiming to present objective facts, as per your guidelines. The provided relationships might not be exhaustive, given the text's content. 

  Please verify these extracted entities according to your requirements.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
