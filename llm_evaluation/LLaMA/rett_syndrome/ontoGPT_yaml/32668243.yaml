input_text: In Vivo Repair of a Protein Underlying a Neurological Disorder by Programmable
  RNA Editing. Programmable RNA editing is gaining momentum as an approach to repair
  mutations, but its efficiency in repairing endogenous mutant RNA in complex tissue
  is unknown. Here we apply this approach to the brain and successfully repair a guanosine-to-adenosine
  mutation in methyl CpG binding protein 2 RNA that causes the neurodevelopmental
  disease Rett syndrome. Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile
  Mecp2317G>A mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic
  domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50%
  of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2
  protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type
  levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that
  the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less. This study
  demonstrates that programmable RNA editing can be utilized to repair mutations in
  mouse models of neurological disease.
