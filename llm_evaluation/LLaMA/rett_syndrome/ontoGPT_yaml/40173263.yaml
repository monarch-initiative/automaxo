input_text: Self-regulating gene therapy ameliorates phenotypes and overcomes gene
  dosage sensitivity in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Conventional methods of gene
  transfer lead to inconsistent transgene expression within cells. This variability
  can be problematic, particularly in conditions like Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological
  disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene, because
  overexpression of MECP2 can also cause adverse effects. To address these challenges,
  we devised a gene regulation system called Expression Attenuation via Construct
  Tuning (EXACT), which uses a self-contained, microRNA-based feed-forward loop that
  not only ensures more consistent transgene expression but also protects against
  excessive expression. Through cell-based screening assays, we demonstrated the ability
  of the EXACT circuit to modulate the expression of full-length human MeCP2. Compared
  with a conventional construct, an EXACT-MECP2 construct exhibited a narrower range
  of cellular protein abundance. Furthermore, the degree of regulation by the EXACT
  circuit increased with higher transgene doses in vitro and in wild-type mice and
  mice modeling RTT. On the basis of cellular and in vivo testing, we identified an
  optimal configuration for the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) construct
  for self-regulated MECP2 gene therapy, designated NGN-401. Delivery of NGN-401 to
  neonatal male Mecp2-/y hemizygous mice via intracerebroventricular injection resulted
  in prolonged survival and amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes compared with vehicle-treated
  animals. NGN-401 was also well tolerated by female Mecp2+/- mice and healthy juvenile
  nonhuman primates, in contrast with a conventional construct, which caused toxicity.
  The results from these studies underpin a first-in-human pediatric trial of NGN-401
  in RTT (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05898620).
