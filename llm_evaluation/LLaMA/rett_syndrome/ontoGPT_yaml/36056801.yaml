input_text: 'State-of-the-art therapies for Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome (RTT) is
  an X-linked neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations of the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding
  protein 2) gene. Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal
  roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance,
  and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its
  reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic
  approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of
  innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment
  of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges
  of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement
  therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome.
  WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement
  therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New
  developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome
  open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels.
  Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future
  work is needed to improve brain delivery.'
