input_text: Forniceal deep brain stimulation induces gene expression and splicing
  changes that promote neurogenesis and plasticity. Clinical trials are currently
  underway to assess the efficacy of forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS) for improvement
  of memory in Alzheimer's patients, and forniceal DBS has been shown to improve learning
  and memory in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), an intellectual disability disorder
  caused by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2. The mechanism of DBS benefits has
  been elusive, however, so we assessed changes in gene expression, splice isoforms,
  DNA methylation, and proteome following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and
  mice lacking Mecp2. We found that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function,
  cell survival, and neurogenesis and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered
  in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover, DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated
  in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue
  from patients with Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit
  individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.
