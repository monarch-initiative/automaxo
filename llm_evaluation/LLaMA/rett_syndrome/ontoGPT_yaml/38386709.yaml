input_text: "Variable expression of MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 in the human brain: Implications
  for gene restorative therapies. MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 are three X-linked neurodevelopmental
  genes associated with Rett, CDKL5-, and fragile-X syndrome, respectively. These
  syndromes are characterized by distinct constellations of severe cognitive and neurobehavioral
  anomalies, reflecting the broad but unique expression patterns of each of the genes
  in the brain. As these disorders are not thought to be neurodegenerative and may
  be reversible, a major goal has been to restore expression of the functional proteins
  in the patient's brain. Strategies have included gene therapy, gene editing, and
  selective Xi-reactivation methodologies. However, tissue penetration and overall
  delivery to various regions of the brain remain challenging for each strategy. Thus,
  gaining insights into how much restoration would be required and what regions/cell
  types in the brain must be targeted for meaningful physiological improvement would
  be valuable. As a step toward addressing these questions, here we perform a meta-analysis
  of single-cell transcriptomics data from the human brain across multiple developmental
  stages, in various brain regions, and in multiple donors. We observe a substantial
  degree of expression variability for MECP2, CDKL5, and FMR1 not only across cell
  types but also between donors. The wide range of expression may help define a therapeutic
  window, with the low end delineating a minimum level required to restore physiological
  function and the high end informing toxicology margin. Finally, the inter-cellular
  and inter-individual variability enable identification of co-varying genes and will
  facilitate future identification of biomarkers."
