input_text: Safety and efficacy of genetic MECP2 supplementation in the R294X mouse
  model of Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused predominantly
  by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2, encoding transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding
  protein 2 (MeCP2). Although no disease-modifying therapies exist at this time, some
  proposed therapeutic strategies aim to supplement the mutant allele with a wild-type
  allele producing typical levels of functional MeCP2, such as gene therapy. Because
  MECP2 is a dosage-sensitive gene, with both loss and gain of function causing disease,
  these approaches must achieve a narrow therapeutic window to be both safe and effective.
  While MeCP2 supplementation rescues RTT-like phenotypes in mouse models, the tolerable
  threshold of MeCP2 is not clear, particularly for partial loss-of-function mutations.
  We assessed the safety of genetically supplementing full-length human MeCP2 in the
  context of the R294X allele, a common partial loss-of-function mutation retaining
  DNA-binding capacity. We assessed the potential for adverse effects from MeCP2 supplementation
  of a partial loss-of-function mutant and the potential for dominant negative interactions
  between mutant and full-length MeCP2. In male hemizygous R294X mice, MeCP2 supplementation
  rescued RTT-like behavioral phenotypes and did not elicit behavioral evidence of
  excess MeCP2. In female heterozygous R294X mice, RTT-specific phenotypes were similarly
  rescued. However, MeCP2 supplementation led to evidence of excess MeCP2 activity
  in a motor coordination assay, suggesting that the underlying motor circuitry is
  particularly sensitive to MeCP2 dosage in females. These results show that genetic
  supplementation of full-length MeCP2 is safe in males and largely so females. However,
  careful consideration of risk for adverse motor effects may be warranted for girls
  and women with RTT.
