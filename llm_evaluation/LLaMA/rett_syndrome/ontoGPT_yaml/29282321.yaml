input_text: A mixed modality approach towards Xi reactivation for Rett syndrome and
  other X-linked disorders. The X-chromosome harbors hundreds of disease genes whose
  associated diseases predominantly affect males. However, a subset, including neurodevelopmental
  disorders, Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X syndrome, and CDKL5 syndrome, also affects
  females. These disorders lack disease-specific treatment. Because female cells carry
  two X chromosomes, an emerging treatment strategy has been to reawaken the healthy
  allele on the inactive X (Xi). Here, we focus on methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2)
  restoration for RTT and combinatorially target factors in the interactome of Xist,
  the noncoding RNA responsible for X inactivation. We identify a mixed modality approach
  combining an Xist antisense oligonucleotide and a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA
  methylation, which, together, achieve 30,000-fold MECP2 up-regulation from the Xi
  in cultured cells. Combining a brain-specific genetic Xist ablation with short-term
  5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) treatment models the synergy in vivo without evident
  toxicity. The Xi is selectively reactivated. These experiments provide proof of
  concept for a mixed modality approach for treating X-linked disorders in females.
