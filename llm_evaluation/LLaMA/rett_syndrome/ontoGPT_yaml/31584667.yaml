input_text: 'Feasibility and Effectiveness of an Individualized 12-Week "Uptime" Participation
  (U-PART) Intervention in Girls and Women With Rett Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Girls and
  women with Rett Syndrome (RTT) have low levels of daily physical activity and high
  levels of sedentary time. Reducing sedentary time and enhancing "uptime" activities,
  such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address
  long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was
  to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week
  uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN:
  The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline,
  postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing
  a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized
  programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day
  center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire.
  Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes
  were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment
  scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT
  participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar
  scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with
  small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily
  step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75
  points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were
  maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term
  follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However,
  participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially
  mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible
  and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.'
