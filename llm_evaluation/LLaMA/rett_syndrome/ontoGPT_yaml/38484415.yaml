input_text: "Adolescents with Rett syndrome at critical care pathway junctures: Examining
  clinicians' decision to initiate invasive long-term ventilation. BACKGROUND: The
  initiation of invasive long-term ventilation (I-LTV) for an adolescent with Rett
  Syndrome (RTT) involves many serious bioethical considerations. In moving towards
  a more inclusive model of patient participation, transparency surrounding the main
  influencing factors around this decision is important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify
  the main drivers influencing a clinician's decision to support initiation of I-LTV
  for an adolescent with RTT. METHOD: We used an anonymous online vignette-based factorial
  survey. The survey was distributed internationally through eight professional multi-disciplinary
  organisations to reach clinicians working in paediatrics. RESULTS: We analysed 504
  RTT vignettes completed by 246 clinicians using mixed effect regression modelling.
  The main three significant influencing factors identified were: parental agreement
  with the decision to support initiation, the family's support network, and proximity
  to a tertiary care centre. Additional comments from participants focused on family
  support, and the importance of on-going communication with the family. CONCLUSION:
  As the rights of those with disabilities improve and participation of adolescents
  in decision-making becomes more established, effective communications with the family
  around goals of care and particular sensitivity and reflective practice around methods
  of consensus building will likely contribute to a positive decision-making process
  at this difficult time."

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome

  medical_actions: invasive long-term ventilation; initiation of invasive long-term ventilation

  symptoms: None

  chemicals: None

  action_annotation_relationships: invasive long-term ventilation TREATS respiratory needs IN Rett syndrome; initiation of invasive long-term ventilation TREATS respiratory needs IN Rett syndrome 

  Note that the text does not explicitly mention specific symptoms of Rett syndrome, but it implies that the medical action (invasive long-term ventilation) is related to treating respiratory needs associated with the disease. Also, the text does not mention specific chemicals or drugs. 

  Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on these extracted entities.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
