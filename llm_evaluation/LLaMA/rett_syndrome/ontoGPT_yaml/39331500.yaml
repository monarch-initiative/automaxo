input_text: Protocol for the neonatal intracerebroventricular delivery of adeno-associated
  viral vectors for brain restoration of MECP2 for Rett syndrome. Here, we present
  a protocol for neonatal intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of adeno-associated
  viral vectors (AAVs), achieving gene therapy for a Rett syndrome mouse model. We
  describe steps for preparing mouse lines, replacing foster mothers, sex typing,
  and genotyping. We then detail procedures for ICV delivery and validation through
  immunofluorescent and immunoblot techniques. This protocol is also applicable to
  preclinical gene therapy research that targets the neonatal mouse brain for other
  neurodevelopmental disorders. For complete details on the use and execution of this
  protocol, please refer to Yang et al.1.

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome
  medical_actions: intracerebroventricular delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors; gene therapy; immunofluorescent techniques; immunoblot techniques
  symptoms: None
  chemicals: adeno-associated viral vectors
  action_annotation_relationships: adeno-associated viral vectors TREATS Rett syndrome; gene therapy TREATS Rett syndrome; intracerebroventricular delivery TREATS Rett syndrome; MECP2 gene therapy TREATS Rett syndrome IN mouse model 

  Note that the text does not provide a comprehensive list of symptoms for Rett syndrome. The focus of the text is on a protocol for gene therapy to treat Rett syndrome. 

  Also, I couldn't verify the citations as I don't have access to search or a database, so you should double-check the citation to Yang et al.1.
