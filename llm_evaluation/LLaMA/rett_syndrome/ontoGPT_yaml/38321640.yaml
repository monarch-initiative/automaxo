input_text: 'Atypical brain responses to 40-Hz click trains in girls with Rett syndrome:
  Auditory steady-state response and sustained wave. AIM: The current study aimed
  to infer neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory processing in children with Rett
  syndrome (RTT)-rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by MECP2 mutations. We examined
  two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response
  (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave
  (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS:
  We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1
  years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train
  auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus
  intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used
  to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal
  dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically
  small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from
  typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern
  of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood
  but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but
  not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development
  in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION:
  ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory
  processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between
  genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.'
