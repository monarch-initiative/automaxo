input_text: 'Treating Rett syndrome: from mouse models to human therapies. Rare diseases
  are very difficult to study mechanistically and to develop therapies for because
  of the scarcity of patients. Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome
  (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse
  models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused
  by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant
  mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly,
  or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT
  patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their
  mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence
  of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems,
  it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments.
  Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat
  RTT patients.'

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome

  medical_actions: precision medicine; preclinical studies; treatment of MECP2 gene; treatment of downstream pathways; combination of treatments

  symptoms: Not explicitly mentioned, but mentioned as "development of symptoms"

  chemicals: Not explicitly mentioned

  action_annotation_relationships: precision medicine TREATS Rett syndrome; preclinical studies (targeting MECP2 gene) TREATS Rett syndrome; treatment (of MECP2 gene) TREATS symptoms IN Rett syndrome; treatment (of downstream pathways) TREATS symptoms IN Rett syndrome 

  Note that some of the information is not explicitly mentioned in the text, and some relationships can be inferred. Also, note that the text does not provide a comprehensive list of symptoms, and the symptoms are mentioned as "development of symptoms" which is a general term. 

  Please let me know if you need further clarification. 

  Also, I want to mention that I don't have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the user should double-check any information I provide.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
