input_text: Maternal Experience-Dependent Cortical Plasticity in Mice Is Circuit-
  and Stimulus-Specific and Requires MECP2. The neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome
  is caused by mutations in the gene Mecp2 Misexpression of the protein MECP2 is thought
  to contribute to neuropathology by causing dysregulation of plasticity. Female heterozygous
  Mecp2 mutants (Mecp2het ) failed to acquire a learned maternal retrieval behavior
  when exposed to pups, an effect linked to disruption of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory
  interneurons (PV) in the auditory cortex. Nevertheless, how dysregulated PV networks
  affect the neural activity dynamics that underlie auditory cortical plasticity during
  early maternal experience is unknown. Here we show that maternal experience in WT
  adult female mice (WT) triggers suppression of PV auditory responses. We also observe
  concomitant disinhibition of auditory responses in deep-layer pyramidal neurons
  that is selective for behaviorally relevant pup vocalizations. These neurons further
  exhibit sharpened tuning for pup vocalizations following maternal experience. All
  of these neuronal changes are abolished in Mecp2het , suggesting that they are an
  essential component of maternal learning. This is further supported by our finding
  that genetic manipulation of GABAergic networks that restores accurate retrieval
  behavior in Mecp2het also restores maternal experience-dependent plasticity of PV.
  Our data are consistent with a growing body of evidence that cortical networks are
  particularly vulnerable to mutations of Mecp2 in PV neurons. Moreover, our work
  links, for the first time, impaired in vivo cortical plasticity in awake Mecp2 mutant
  animals to a natural, ethologically relevant behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rett
  syndrome is a genetic disorder that includes language communication problems. Nearly
  all Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that produces the protein MECP2,
  which is important for changes in brain connectivity believed to underlie learning.
  We previously showed that female Mecp2 mutants fail to learn a simple maternal care
  behavior performed in response to their pups' distress cries. This impairment appeared
  to critically involve inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex called parvalbumin
  neurons. Here we record from these neurons before and after maternal experience,
  and we show that they adapt their response to pup calls during maternal learning
  in nonmutants, but not in mutants. This adaptation is partially restored by a manipulation
  that improves learning.
