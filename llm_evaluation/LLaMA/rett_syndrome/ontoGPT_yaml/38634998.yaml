input_text: "Pre-op considerations in neuromuscular scoliosis deformity surgery: proceedings
  of the half day course at the 58th annual meeting of the Scoliosis Research Society.
  Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are
  frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they
  have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies
  have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging
  from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center
  (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012;
  Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg
  Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative
  period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased
  long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular
  patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673,
  2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828,
  2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize
  the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order
  to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their
  treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported
  rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these
  patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in
  Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508,
  2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23%
  of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second
  procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in
  Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to
  surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation
  failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk
  of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of
  scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise
  remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering
  procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013).
  Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can
  be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016).
  Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated
  with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome
  or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following
  article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the
  58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the
  world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular
  scoliosis."
