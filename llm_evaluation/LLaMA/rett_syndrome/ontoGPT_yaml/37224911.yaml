input_text: Photodynamic therapy for intergluteal warts in a child affected by Rett
  syndrome. Genital warts (GWs) are the most common sexually transmitted infections
  worldwide, caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The increasing prevalence of
  GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents
  a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity,
  and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic
  therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral
  warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric
  population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat
  area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an
  X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital
  condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions
  was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult
  lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this
  procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy
  is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side
  effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.

  However, I made some changes as below.

  medical_actions: photodynamic therapy (C-PDT); conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT)
  symptoms: genital condylomatosis; florid genital condylomatosis
  chemicals: 
  action_annotation_relationships: photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) TREATS genital condylomatosis IN Genital warts; photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) TREATS florid genital condylomatosis IN Genital warts; conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) TREATS genital condylomatosis IN Genital warts 

  I removed Rett syndrome as a primary disease since, according to the provided text, it seems to be a comorbid condition rather than the main disease being discussed. The focus appears to be on treating genital warts in a patient with Rett syndrome.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
