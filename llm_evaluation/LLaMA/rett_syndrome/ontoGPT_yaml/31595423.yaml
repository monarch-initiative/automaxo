input_text: Effects of oral administration of common antioxidant supplements on the
  energy metabolism of red blood cells. Attenuation of oxidative stress-induced changes
  in Rett syndrome erythrocytes by CoQ10. Nutritional supplements are traditionally
  employed for overall health and for managing some health conditions, although controversies
  are found concerning the role of antioxidants-mediated benefits in vivo. Consistently
  with its critical role in systemic redox buffering, red blood cell (RBC) is recognized
  as a biologically relevant target to investigate the effects of oxidative stress.
  In RBC, reduction of the ATP levels and adenylate energy charge brings to disturbance
  in intracellular redox status. In the present work, several popular antioxidant
  supplements were orally administrated to healthy adults and examined for their ability
  to induce changes on the energy metabolism and oxidative status in RBC. Fifteen
  volunteers (3 per group) were treated for 30 days per os with epigallocatechin gallate
  (EGCG) (1 g green tea extract containing 50% EGCG), resveratrol (325 mg), coenzyme
  Q10 (CoQ10) (300 mg), vitamin C (1 g), and vitamin E (400 U.I.). Changes in the
  cellular levels of high-energy compounds (i.e., ATP and its catabolites, NAD and
  GTP), GSH, GSSG, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were simultaneously analyzed by ion-pairing
  HPLC. Response to oxidative stress was further investigated through the oxygen radical
  absorptive capacity (ORAC) assay. According to our experimental approach, (i) CoQ10
  appeared to be the most effective antioxidant inducing a high increase in ATP/ADP,
  ATP/AMP, GSH/GSSG ratio and ORAC value and, in turn, a reduction of NAD concentration,
  (ii) EGCG modestly modulated the intracellular energy charge potential, while (iii)
  Vitamin E, vitamin C, and resveratrol exhibited very weak effects. Given that, the
  antioxidant potential of CoQ10 was additionally assessed in a pilot study which
  considered individuals suffering from Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked neuro-developmental
  disorder in which RBC oxidative damages provide biological markers for redox imbalance
  and chronic hypoxemia. RTT patients (n = 11), with the typical clinical form, were
  supplemented for 12 months with CoQ10 (300 mg, once daily). Level of lipid peroxidation
  (MDA production) and energy state of RBCs were analyzed at 2 and 12 months. Our
  data suggest that CoQ10 may significantly attenuate the oxidative stress-induced
  damage in RTT erythrocytes.
