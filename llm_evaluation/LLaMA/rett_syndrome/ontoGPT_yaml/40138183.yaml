input_text: 'A Blueprint for Translational Precision Medicine in Autism Spectrum Disorder
  and Related Neurogenetic Syndromes. Objectives: Despite growing knowledge of the
  underlying neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurogenetic
  syndromes, treatment discovery has remained elusive. In this review, we provide
  a blueprint for translational precision medicine in ASD and related neurogenetic
  syndromes. Methods: The discovery of trofinetide for Rett syndrome (RTT) is described,
  and the role of nonmammalian, mammalian, and stem cell model systems in the identification
  of molecular targets and drug screening is discussed. We then provide a framework
  for translating preclinical findings to human clinical trials, including the role
  of biomarkers in selecting molecular targets and evaluating target engagement, and
  discuss how to leverage these findings for future ASD drug development. Results:
  Multiple preclinical model systems for ASD have been developed, each with tradeoffs
  with regard to suitability for high-throughput small molecule screening, conservation
  across species, and behavioral face validity. Future clinical trials should incorporate
  biomarkers and intermediate phenotypes to demonstrate target engagement. Factors
  that contributed to the approval of trofinetide for RTT included replicated findings
  in mouse models, a well-studied natural history of the syndrome, development of
  RTT-specific outcome measures, and strong engagement of the RTT family community.
  Conclusions: The translation of our growing understanding of the neurobiology of
  ASD to human drug discovery will require a precision medicine approach, including
  the use of multiple model systems for molecular target selection, evaluation of
  target engagement, and clinical trial design strategies that address heterogeneity,
  power, and the placebo response.'
