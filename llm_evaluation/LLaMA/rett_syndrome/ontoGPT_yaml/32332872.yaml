input_text: High rate of HDR in gene editing of p.(Thr158Met) MECP2 mutational hotspot.
  Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder which affects almost
  exclusively girls, caused by variants in MECP2 gene. Effective therapies for this
  devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of
  MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy risky.
  For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a preferable
  option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we developed
  and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming of patient-derived
  primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This cellular model represents
  an important source for our studies, aiming to correct MECP2 variants in neurons
  which represent the primarily affected cell type. We engineered a gene editing toolkit
  composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a hotspot missense variant in MECP2,
  c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct expresses the variant-specific
  sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent reporter system. The second construct
  brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS
  analysis on sorted cells from four independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally
  high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of HDR and less than 1% of indels in all
  patients, outlining the relevant potentiality of the approach for Rett syndrome
  therapy.
