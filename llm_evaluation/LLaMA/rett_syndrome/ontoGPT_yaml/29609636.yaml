input_text: A perspective on "cure" for Rett syndrome. The reversal of the Rett syndrome
  disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families
  and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests
  that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to
  patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between
  enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been
  a fragmentation of the "Rett syndrome community" with some groups giving priority
  to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based
  interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support
  for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development
  that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a "cure" for patients with Rett syndrome.
  While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe
  and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels
  of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that
  it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies
  with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should
  not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected
  patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a "cure". Thus,
  interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should
  not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.

  Here are the extracted entities:

  primary_disease: Rett syndrome

  medical_actions: rational treatments; therapy-based interventions; clinical trials; medical interventions

  symptoms: None

  chemicals: MECP2 gene expression; MECP2

  action_annotation_relationships: rational treatments TREATS Rett syndrome; therapy-based interventions ENHANCES quality of life IN Rett syndrome; clinical trials TREATS Rett syndrome; MECP2 gene expression RESTORES normal levels IN Rett syndrome; interventions TREATS symptoms IN Rett syndrome 

  However, I revised action_annotation_relationships to better represent relationships as per your format guidelines.

  action_annotation_relationships: rational treatments TREATS Rett syndrome; therapy-based interventions PREVENTS poor quality of life IN Rett syndrome; clinical trials TREATS Rett syndrome; MECP2 gene expression RESTORES normal levels IN Rett syndrome; interventions AIMED AT ENHANCING quality of life IN Rett syndrome 

  But note the following better representation of  action_annotation_relationships 
  action_annotation_relationships: rational treatment TREATS Rett syndrome; therapy-based intervention TREATS poor quality of life IN Rett syndrome; MECP2 gene expression RESTORES normal levels IN Rett syndrome

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
