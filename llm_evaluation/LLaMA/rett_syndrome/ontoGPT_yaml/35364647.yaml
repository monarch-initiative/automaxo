input_text: "Impact of a 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention
  on gross motor function in women with Rett syndrome. BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is
  a rare genetic neurological syndrome that affects mostly females. The syndrome leads
  to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including
  speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms
  include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and
  signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the
  quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject
  to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross
  motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome
  Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological
  physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross
  Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012).
  Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for
  a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes.
  CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment
  sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance
  exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant
  impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention
  program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected
  from late motor deterioration."
