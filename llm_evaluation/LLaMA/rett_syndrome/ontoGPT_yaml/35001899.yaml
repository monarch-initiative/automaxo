input_text: "A semi-standardized music therapy intervention for girls with Rett syndrome:
  A descriptive essay. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder
  resulting in a wide range of functional impairments and therefore greatly impacts
  the lives of both patients and their families. While genetic and medical aspects
  have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still
  in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative
  framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon
  the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and
  affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation
  medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention
  and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future
  clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not
  been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However
  this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary
  therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and
  implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects
  such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute
  fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks."
