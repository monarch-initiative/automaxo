input_text: Total RNA Sequencing of Rett Syndrome Autopsy Samples Identifies the M4
  Muscarinic Receptor as a Novel Therapeutic Target. Mutations in the MeCP2 gene are
  responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). MeCP2 is a
  DNA-binding protein whose abundance and ability to complex with histone deacetylase
  3 is linked to the regulation of chromatin structure. Consequently, loss-of-function
  mutations in MeCP2 are predicted to have broad effects on gene expression. However,
  to date, studies in mouse models of RTT have identified a limited number of gene
  or pathway-level disruptions, and even fewer genes have been identified that could
  be considered amenable to classic drug discovery approaches. Here, we performed
  RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on nine motor cortex and six cerebellar autopsy samples
  from RTT patients and controls. This approach identified 1887 significantly affected
  genes in the motor cortex and 2110 genes in the cerebellum, with a global trend
  toward increased expression. Pathway-level analysis identified enrichment in genes
  associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, long-term potentiation,
  and axon guidance. A survey of our RNA-seq results also identified a significant
  decrease in expression of the CHRM4 gene, which encodes a receptor [muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor 4 (M4)] that is the subject of multiple large drug discovery efforts for
  schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. We confirmed that CHRM4 expression was decreased
  in RTT patients, and, excitingly, we demonstrated that M4 potentiation normalizes
  social and cognitive phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice. This work provides an experimental
  paradigm in which translationally relevant targets can be identified using transcriptomics
  in RTT autopsy samples, back-modeled in Mecp2+/- mice, and assessed for preclinical
  efficacy using existing pharmacological tool compounds.
