input_text: "Impact of Gastrostomy Placement on Nutritional Status, Physical Health,
  and Parental Well-Being of Females with Rett Syndrome: A Longitudinal Study of an
  Australian Population. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how age-related trends in nutritional
  status, physical health, and parental well-being in females with Rett syndrome may
  be related to gastrostomy placement and to examine the impact of the procedure on
  mortality. STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome
  Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data
  collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We
  used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures
  of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional
  hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals
  with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy
  placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI)
  improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement
  than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association
  between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental
  physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy
  insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause
  mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with
  those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy
  placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome,
  but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear."
