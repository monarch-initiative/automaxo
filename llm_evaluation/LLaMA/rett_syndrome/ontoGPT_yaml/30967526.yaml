input_text: Auditory sensory memory span for duration is severely curtailed in females
  with Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused
  by mutations in the MECP2 gene, is typified by profound cognitive impairment and
  severe language impairment, rendering it very difficult to accurately measure auditory
  processing capabilities behaviorally in this population. Here we leverage the mismatch
  negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability
  of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of
  auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension,
  has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully
  recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls
  (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for
  excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and
  deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus
  presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900,
  and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency
  of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but
  only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
  group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only.
  MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study
  indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the
  span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications
  for speech decoding abilities.
