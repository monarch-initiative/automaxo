input_text: 'Severe offtarget effects following intravenous delivery of AAV9-MECP2
  in a female mouse model of Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked
  neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily caused by mutations in the methyl
  CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). RTT is the second most prevalent genetic cause
  of intellectual disability in girls, and there is currently no cure for the disease.
  We have previously shown that gene therapy using a self-complementary AAV9 viral
  vector expressing a codon-optimized Mecp2 version (AAV9-MCO) significantly improved
  symptoms and increased survival in male Mecp2-deficient mice. Here, we pursued our
  studies and investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term gene therapy in the
  genetically relevant RTT mouse model: the heterozygous (HET) Mecp2 deficient female
  mouse. These mice were injected with the AAV9-MCO vector through the tail vein and
  an array of behavioral tests was performed. At 16- and 30-weeks post-injection,
  this treatment was able to rescue apneas and improved the spontaneous locomotor
  deficits and circadian locomotor activity in Mecp2 HET mice treated with AAV9-MCO
  at a dose of 5 x 1011 vg/mouse. To examine whether a higher dose of vector could
  result in increased improvements, we injected Mecp2 HET mice with a higher MCO vector
  dose (1012 vg/mouse), which resulted in some severe, sometimes lethal, side effects.
  In order to confirm these effects, a new cohort of Mecp2 HET mice were administered
  increasing doses of MCO vector (1011, 5 x 1011 and 1012 vg/mouse). Again, two weeks
  after vector administration, some Mecp2 HET mice were found dead while others displayed
  severe side effects and had to be euthanized. These deleterious effects were not
  observed in Mecp2 HET mice injected with a high dose of AAV9-GFP and were directly
  proportionate to vector dosage (0, 23 or 54% mortality at an AAV9-MCO dose of 1011,
  5 x 1011, 1012 vg/mouse, respectively), and no such lethality was observed in wild-type
  (WT) mice. In the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the high and medium AAV9-MCO doses,
  blood chemistry analysis and post-mortem histology showed liver damage with drastically
  elevated levels of liver transaminases and disorganized liver architecture. Apoptosis
  was confirmed by the presence of TUNEL- and cleaved-caspase 3-positive cells in
  the Mecp2 HET mice treated with the higher doses of AAV9-MCO. We then studied the
  involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in triggering apoptosis since
  it can be activated by AAV vectors. Increased expression of the C/EBP homologous
  protein (CHOP), one of UPR downstream effectors, was confirmed in Mecp2 HET mice
  after vector administration. The toxic reaction seen in some treated mice indicates
  that, although gene therapy for RTT improved breathing deficits observed in Mecp2
  HET mice, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms
  and caution must be exercised before similar attempts are undertaken in female Rett
  patients.'
