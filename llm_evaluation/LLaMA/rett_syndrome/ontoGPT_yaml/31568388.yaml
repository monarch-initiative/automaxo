input_text: 'Efficacy of an Aquatic Exercise Program for 3 Cases of Rett Syndrome.
  PURPOSE: To examine functional, physiological effects of participating in an aquatic
  exercise program by 3 girls, diagnosed with Rett syndrome (RS), to explore areas
  for possible new research. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: RS is a severe neurodevelopmental
  disorder, which causes multiple disabilities and serious impairments in neuromotor
  and cognitive abilities. Three girls (4, 6, and 7 years), diagnosed stage III RS,
  participated in 20 months of aquatic exercise, with individually tailored, full
  body exercises, progressively targeting functional, cardiorespiratory, muscle, and
  flexibility training. Assessments included resting and exercise heart rates, anthropometric
  measures, functional, clinical aspects, and psychosocial abilities. CONCLUSIONS:
  The participants improved functional ability, mood status, relations with family
  and schoolmates, joint mobility, muscle strength, and endurance during functional
  activities. Periodic evaluation of exercise heart rates averaged an increase in
  intensity of 33% above baseline, indicating cardiorespiratory stimulus. This pilot
  program provides clinical rationale for future studies and clinical interventions
  for RS children.'
